XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant) is a citizen of Liberia. After advocating for children's rights in Liberia as a youth, the Appellant moved to the United States (US) and lived there for many years. He now fears retaliation for his activism dating back to 2010-2013. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dismissed his claim as not credible. On appeal, the Appellant has argued that the RPD's analysis is flawed. I agree that the RPD committed some errors. That being said, I do not find that the Appellant's claim has an objective basis. Here are my reasons explaining why.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD, for other reasons, that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant was born in Monrovia, Liberia. Beginning at about 13 years old, he became involved in activism for children's rights. From 2010 to 2012, he served as the XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In this role, his activities included things such as speaking on radio, travelling to communities to promote awareness of children's rights, and lobbying authorities in particular cases. He faced some threats during this time but did not consider them life threatening.\n[4] In approximately 2013, the Appellant was an exchange student in the US. He returned there with a student visa in XXXX 2014, where he stayed until he came to Canada in XXXX 2019. The Appellant married an American citizen and was being sponsored; this relationship broke down, and the two filed for divorce in XXXX 2019. The Appellant no longer had status in the US. He received an anonymous threatening call two weeks after he filed for divorce, on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and decided to come to Canada to seek protection. Two days after he arrived in Canada, on XXXX XXXX, 2019, the Appellant's father's home was visited by unknown men making threats based upon the Appellant's advocacy work many years before. His father claims to have received some additional threatening calls, but no other visits until XXXX XXXX, 2021. The RPD heard the Appellant's claim on November 19, 2021.\n[5] The RPD rejected this claim for lack of credibility. Upon reviewing the appeal, I felt that objective basis was the determinative issue. To ensure that the Appellant and the Minister had an opportunity to know the case to meet, I sent a notice that I would be considering a new issue on appeal: \"what is the objective, forward-facing, basis for the Appellant's risk in Liberia today?\"\n[6] The Appellant responded, and this response is considered below. The Minister did not respond.\nNEW EVIDENCE ACCEPTED\n[7] The Appellant presents some new evidence in response to the new issue that I raised:\na. Email from XXXX XXXX, who worked in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with the Appellant, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, with identity card attached;\nb. A screenshot of a Facebook profile for the Honourable XXXX XXXX XXXX;\nc. A document from Liberia National Police, dated XXXX XXXX, 2021 (already submitted to the RPD);\nd. A statement from the Appellant, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.\n[8] I can only accept evidence that arose after the RPD decision; or was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.1\n[9] Since the document from the police is already part of the RPD record, I do not need to decide on its admissibility. I have assessed it below. The other documents, though they were available at the time of the RPD's decision, were provided in response to my question. For this reason, I accept that they could not have been expected to have been presented earlier. They appear sufficiently new, credible, and relevant for the purposes of admissibility.\n[10] I can only hold an oral hearing where I have serious concerns about the Appellant's credibility that are raised by the new evidence and that that might justify allowing or dismissing the refugee claim. I have no credibility concerns with the documents. For this reason, I did not hold a hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[11] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 I may also raise new issues by providing notice, as I have done in this case.\n[12] The RPD dismissed the Appellant's claim because of credibility concerns. I agree with the Appellant that some of this analysis was flawed. For example, the RPD was microscopic in its consideration of the specific content of the threats made - I accept that the threats are said to have dealt with the imprisonment of family members as a result of the Appellant's advocacy work.\n[13] I understand, however, why the RPD had credibility concerns. I, myself, find it implausible that the Appellant lived, without threat or incident, for 5 years in the US, and only when he was out of status there did any problems appear in Liberia. The only specific threats coincide fortuitously with when the Appellant came to Canada and then, a year later, just before his RPD hearing.\n[14] This being said, plausibility findings are to be reserved for the clearest of cases. I am prepared to accept, for the purposes of my analysis of the objective basis of this claim, that these threats occurred. I do not find, however, that the Appellant faces a well-founded fear in Liberia today. Here is why.\nThis claim has no objective basis\n[15] A refugee claim has a subjective and objective component. While a claimant may subjectively fear something, this does not mean that the risks are objectively borne out. For a positive claim, there must be evidence to establish that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution under s. 96 of the Act, or that it is more likely than not (a balance of probabilities) that he faces a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under s. 97 of the Act.\n[16] I do not find that this is the case in this claim. I accept that the Appellant advocated for children's rights in his childhood. There is no evidence before me, however, that he has continued to do so or would continue to do so if he returned to Liberia.\n[17] Counsel has cited a lot of objective evidence in his submissions. Much of it does not relate to the Appellant's circumstances (individuals accused of witchcraft, for example).\n[18] Though counsel refers to him as an \"avowed advocate,\" there is no evidence nor action on the Appellant's part since at best 2013 or 2014 to indicate that this is the case now. I have no evidence that he continued this work after he left Liberia or plans to do so if he were to return there.\n[19] I also do not find that the Appellant's past advocacy work creates an objective basis for his fear either.\n[20] I understand that before he moved to the US in 2013, the Appellant faced harassment, verbal abuse, and physical harassment such as having wastewater thrown on him.3 He did not find any of this treatment life-threatening.4\n[21] In XXXX 2019, the Appellant received a threatening telephone call. Unknown individuals made threats against the Appellant's father and his family in XXXX 2019 and again in XXXX 2021. The police report submitted indicates that on the first occasion, the perpetrators threw rocks at the house and threatened to \"make sure to harm [the Appellant's] entire family unless their children or family members are [released] from prison.\"5 In XXXX 2021, the Appellant's father reported that rocks were again thrown at the house, and there had been anonymous calls threatening to harm the entire family, especially the Appellant.6 The Appellant's father says that he relocated. After this relocation, however, there is no evidence of any further threats. It is now more than two years, then, since any threats have been received. The Appellant has stated that he fears the XXXX and the XXXX societies because he used to advocate against their traditional practices. The unknown individuals did not identify themselves as members of those groups, but stated that they were family members of those the Appellant caused to be punished for their crimes. There is no indication that the XXXX and XXXX societies are interested in the Appellant on a balance of probabilities.\n[22] It no longer appears that anyone wishes to harm the Appellant or his family. There have been no further telephone calls or threatening visits to his family's home. These isolated incidents are too remote now to establish an objective basis for this claim.\n[23] I have read the email from Mr. XXXX XXXX,7 who indicates that he used to work with the Appellant at the XXXX XXXX. He recounts cases with which they were involved, and says he, too, received threatening remarks. He indicates that in one case, involving Mr. XXXX, the accused is now a magistrate and that because of this Mr. XXXX decided to move to Ivory Coast. Mr. XXXX's statement does not indicate he ever received threats from Mr. XXXX. It does not indicate when he decided to move to Ivory Coast, nor the details of the threats he received or why he feels Liberia is not safe for him. Without these details, I do not find that this statement helps to establish a forward-facing fear for the Appellant today. There is nothing linking Mr. XXXX to the threats made to the Appellant on a balance of probabilities, nor to the threats made to Mr. XXXX.\n[24] I do not find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his past advocacy. Nor do I find that he faces a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment on a balance of probabilities.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD, for other reasons, that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nL.

XXXX XXXX XXXX(Principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX(Minor Associate Appellants), XXXX XXXX(Associate Appellant) are citizens of South Africa. They are appealing the negative decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rendered from the bench, the day of the hearing on January 11, 2022.\n[2] The RPD ruled that Mr. XXXX XXXX, husband of the Principal Appellant, was excluded on the basis of Article 1F(a) of the Convention. In reaching this ruling, the RPD found that there were serious reasons to consider that he significantly and knowingly contributed to crimes against humanity of apartheid while he was employed as a XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX from 1990 until 1994. He was therefore excluded from claiming refugee status. The RPD further found that, even if Mr. XXXX was not to be excluded, he would still not be a Convention refugee for the same reasons that such status was denied to the other Appellants.\n[3] Indeed, the RPD concluded that the Principal Appellant and her children, the Minor Associate Appellants, had failed to establish an objective basis to their fear of being persecuted as a result of their ethnicity, namely being White South Africans, and the perception of wealth that is attached to it. The Principal Appellant and the two female Associate Appellants also failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of their gender.\n[4] I find that the RPD erred in excluding Mr. XXXX, the Associate Appellant, from refugee protection based on his alleged participation in apartheid, as a crime against humanity. Indeed, I find that: (a) the RPD erred in considering only the Rome Statute in assessing whether the alleged conduct that predated its signature constituted apartheid as a crime against humanity; (b) Apartheid, as a crime against humanity, did not form part of customary international law at the time of the alleged conduct; (c) the RPD erred in applying the mens rea of recklessness to the alleged conduct of the Associate Appellant; (d) the Associate Appellant did not contribute in a significant manner, or alternatively in a knowing manner, to the crimes against humanity, of murder and of torture, nor to the illegal common plan consisting of the implementation of apartheid.\n[5] However, I rule that the RPD correctly found that there is a lack of evidence to establish the objective basis of the Appellants' fear of returning to South Africa.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. I find that the Associate Appellant is not excluded from the refugee protection regime, pursuant to section 98 of IRPA, however, I conclude that the RPD correctly found that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of IRPA.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe evidence presented by the Appellants is accepted\n[7] According to the IRPA,1 I can only accept evidence that:\ni. arose after the RPD decision; or\nii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii. that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[8] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.2\n[9] Also, for the RAD to admit the Post Appeal Additional Evidence that was submitted after the filing of the Appellants' record, the Appellants must satisfy the requirements of Rule 29(4) of the RAD Rules. In particular, the RAD must consider the document's relevance and probative value, any new evidence the document brings to the appeal, and whether the person who is the subject of the appeal, with reasonable effort, could have provided the document or written submissions with the Appellant's record.3 Those criteria are cumulative.\n[10] On November 22, 2022, the Appellants submitted a series of additional evidence in support of their contentions regarding the Second Alazar Notice sent by the RAD on August 30, 2022, that responded to the Minister's second intervention dated October 7, 2022. It consists of academic articles and books, as well and international jurisprudence. I find that, since they are linked to the new issue that was not raised before the RPD, the Appellants could not have provided them prior to the perfection of the appeal or the RPD negative decision, thus meeting the requirements of Rule 29(4) of the RAD Rules and section 110 (4) of IRPA. They are also relevant, credible and new and they will be referred to in the analysis. Indeed, their credibility was not challenged by the Minister as they all concern known academics, or they were issued by international instances. They will be admitted into the record under P-4.\n[11] Since this new evidence does not concern the credibility of the Appellants, I find that the criteria of section 110(6) of IRPA are not met and therefore a hearing was not held.\nANALYSIS\n[12] My role is to look at all the evidence, including to listen to the recording of the hearing, and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.4\nExclusion under Article 1F(a) of the Convention\n[13] This part of the analysis is divided in the following manner: (i) the application of the Rome Statute to Pre-1998 events; (ii) the existence in customary international law of apartheid as a crime against humanity between 1990-1994; (iii)\nThe Application of the Rome Statute to Pre-1998 Events\n[14] According to section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA):\nA person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[15] Section F (a) of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention (the Convention) states the following:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes. [emphasis added]\n[16] In its analysis leading to the exclusion of Mr. XXXX, the RPD member referred to article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute), as it was implemented in Canadian jurisdiction through the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act in 2000 (CAHWCA). However, the alleged criminal conduct of Mr. XXXX took place from 1990 until 1994, at least four years prior to the signing of the Rome Statute in 1998 and eight years before its entry into force on July 1, 2002.\n[17] This is particularly important, as the main international instruments pertaining to international criminal law, prior to the Rome Statute, do not list apartheid as a crime against humanity, and neither does the definition of crimes against humanity under the Canadian legislation. In fact, neither the Charter of the International Military Tribunal of 1945 (IMT)5, the Charter of the International Tribunal enacted to prosecute crimes committed by Japan in 19466, Control Council Law No. 107, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)8, nor the Statute for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)9 list apartheid as a crime against humanity. This apparent retroactive application of a criminal law instrument to the alleged criminal acts prompted me to raise a new issue and requested the parties for additional submissions on July 6, 2022 (First Alazar Notice).\n- Parties' Submissions\n[18] The Associate Appellant submitted that the applicability or relevance of the Rome Statute and the CAHWCA to the exclusion cases dealing with alleged acts that predate their implementation is not settled in Canadian jurisprudence. He pleads that the Federal Court in the Jean-Baptiste and Verbanov cases stated that the Rome Statute should be applied to cases in which the alleged crimes occurred after its signature in 1998.10 He alleges that, when a reproached conduct occurred prior to the Rome Statute, Federal Court decisions relied on the existence of customary international law to make the finding that the enumerated act was indeed recognized as a crime against humanity at the time of the reproached conduct, as opposed to exclusively relying on the Rome Statute. Finally, he quotes the holding of Judge Pamel in the Elve case, affirming that the CAHWCA and Rome Statute attach \"new consequences for acts committed prior\" to their implementation, constituting a retrospective, as opposed to a retroactive application of the CAHWCA, but only after a discussion concluding that torture, as a crime against humanity, had been recognised in international customary law prior to the Rome Statute.11 He noted that no similar analysis was carried out in Canadian jurisprudence regarding the crime of apartheid.\n[19] The Minister relies on the Elve case to argue that a distinction needs to be drawn between the concepts of retroactivity and retrospectivity in the application of the Rome Statute, setting aside the Ventocilla precedent in which it was declared that it could not be applied to acts predating its implementation without violating the non-retroactivity ratione personae clause. The Minister affirms that the RAD must come to the same conclusions regarding apartheid, as the Rome Statute and CAHWCA are not applied retroactively, but rather attach new consequences to acts committed prior to their implementation. He adds that, well before the entry into force of the Rome Statute, the international community agreed that the crime of apartheid had to be considered as a crime against humanity, citing Resolution 2202 of the General Assembly of the United Nations dated December 16, 1966, as well as the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid of 1973 (Apartheid Convention). However, in his Additional Memorandum, the Minister argues that the Rome Statute is not a full codification of customary international law at the time of its signature.12 According to the Minister, the Rome Statute is a multilateral treaty that confers jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court (ICC) but is not an authoritative source of conventional law for the purposes of defining an international crime.13\n- Analysis\n[20] The RAD finds the Minister's arguments confusing and seemingly taking contradictory positions, which is unhelpful. It might also be symptomatic of the confusion prevailing in the Canadian jurisprudence dealing with international criminal law in refugee and admissibility cases.\n[21] The RAD believes that a distinction needs to be drawn between sections 35(1)(a) and 98 of IRPA. The former was amended to require the decision-maker to consider the CAHWCA when deciding on admissibility cases.14 However, the legislator chose not to amend section 98 of IRPA to include such reference to the CAHWCA. Indeed, section 98 of IRPA applies the exclusion regime of Article 1F(a) of the Convention that requires the decision maker to assess whether an asylum claimant could be excluded on the grounds that there are serious reasons to consider that he or she committed a crime against peace, a crime against humanity or a war crime as defined in international instruments. It thus follows that the regime of section 98 of IRPA does not require the decision maker to apply Canadian legislation in the context of its analysis. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court or Canada (SCC) in Ezokola stated that Article 1F(a) of the Convention \"instructs us\" to apply international law to reflect the realities of international crimes, beyond the boundaries of Canadian criminal law:\n[44] Whether an individual is complicit in an international crime cannot be considered in light of only one of the world's legal systems: Ramirez, at p. 315; Moreno v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1993 CanLII 2993 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C. 298 (C.A.), at p. 323. This flows not only from the explicit instruction in art. 1F(a) to apply international law, but also from the extraordinary nature of international crimes. They simply transcend domestic norms.\n[46] We are therefore required by both the text of art. 1F(a) and the realities of international crime to look beyond the bounds of Canadian criminal law. We must refrain from interpreting and applying international criminal law as if it were simply the mirror of our domestic criminal law: Cassese's International Criminal Law (3rd ed. 2013), revised by A. Cassese et al., at pp. 6-7. 15 (emphasis added).\n[22] Consequently, I find that the debate as to whether the application of the Rome Statute, as implemented in the CAHWCA, should be considered prospective, and not retroactive, in accordance with the Canadian legislation not to be relevant to the case at bar. A decision maker must assess whether the alleged crime against humanity was part of international customary law at the time of the reproached conduct, the Canadian legislation being one consideration among others.\n[23] I note that, in Verbanov, Justice Grammond referred to paragraph 223 of the Tadic Appeals Judgement of the ICTY to affirm that the definition of international crimes featured in the Rome Statute reflects the intention of the State Parties to codify international customs, supporting the presumption articulated in section 6(4) of the CAHWCA that articles 6 to 8 of the Rome Statute are part of customary international law starting on July 17, 1998, the date of the signature. I note that the ICTY Appeals Chamber was not so specific. The relevant portion of the Tadic case reads:\n223. As for the Rome Statute, at present it is still a non-binding international treaty (it has not yet entered into force). It was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the States attending the Rome Diplomatic Conference and was substantially endorsed by the General Assembly's Sixth Committee on 26 November 1998. In many areas the Statute may be regarded as indicative of the legal views, i.e. opinio juris of a great number of States. Notwithstanding article 10 of the Statute, the purpose of which is to ensure that existing or developing law is not \"limited\" or \"prejudiced\" by the Statute's provisions, resort may be had cum grano salis to these provisions to help elucidate customary international law. Depending on the matter at issue, the Rome Statute may be taken to restate, reflect or clarify customary rules or crystallise them, whereas in some areas it creates new law or modifies existing law. At any event, the Rome Statute by and large may be taken as constituting an authoritative expression of the legal views of a great number of States.16 (emphasis added)\n[24] Justice Grammond's conclusion also relies on the work of the academics.17 However, as argued by the Minister, the same articles actually discuss that the definitions of the crimes included in the Rome Statute may depart from customary international law as some elements might be the results of a consensus.18\n[25] Consequently, I find that articles 6 to 8 of the Rome Statute are, at large, a reflection of customary international law, but elements could also be the result of negotiations, while \"importing deviations and normative developments.\"19 This approach was echoed in the Ezokola case, in which the SCC stated \" despite its importance, the Rome Statute cannot be considered as a complete codification of international criminal law.\"20 In the Mugesera case, the SCC also inferred that the Rome Statute was not a complete codification of customary international law.21 I note that the Verbanov case concerns the application of section 35 of the IRPA instructing the decision maker to apply the Canadian legislation imposing a legal presumption to the effect that the Rome Statute is a reflection of customary international law, which is not the situation in the instant case. I believe that it is also important to note that the International Criminal Court (ICC) itself recognized that the Rome Statute might not always reflect customary international law, especially regarding the crimes listed under article 7 of the Rome Statute.22\n[26] In any event, the legal presumption of the Canadian legislation to the effect that the Rome Statute is an expression of customary international law featured in the CAHWCA only applies to situations that arose after the signature of the Rome Statute. Indeed, section 6 (4) of the CAHWCA indicates that, for situations that arose before July 17, 1998, the Rome Statute may be used as an indication that those crimes were part of international customary law, falling short of imposing a legal presumption:\nFor greater certainty, crimes described in articles 6 and 7 and paragraph 2 of article 8 of the Rome Statute are, as of July 17, 1998, crimes according to customary international law, and may be crimes according to customary international law before that date. This does not limit or prejudice in any way the application of existing or developing rules of international law. [emphasis added]\n[27] This can only be construed as requiring that an analysis be conducted to ascertain whether the crimes of which the claimant is being suspected formed part of the international customary law at the relevant time prior to 1998. Indeed, the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard of proof in the determination of Article 1F(a) exclusions concerns only allegations of facts, not questions of law. The decision maker must assess whether those facts did constitute a crime against humanity at the time of the alleged crime:\nWhen applying the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard, it is important to distinguish between proof of questions of fact and the determination of questions of law. The \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard of proof applies only to questions of fact: Moreno v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1993 CanLII 2993 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C. 298 (C.A.), at p. 311. This means that in this appeal the standard applies to whether Mr. Mugesera gave the speech, to the message it conveyed in a factual sense and to the context in which it was delivered. On the other hand, whether these facts meet the requirements of a crime against humanity is a question of law. Determinations of questions of law are not subject to the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard, since the legal criteria for a crime against humanity will not be made out where there are merely reasonable grounds to believe that the speech could be classified as a crime against humanity. The facts as found on the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard must show that the speech did constitute a crime against humanity in law.23 (emphasis added)\n[28] As held in the Harb case, the Rome Statute can certainly be used as a guide to evaluate whether the crime against humanity in question did form part of customary international law when the alleged criminal acts were perpetrated prior to 1998, but like in this instant case, further evidence was required to be submitted by the Minister in order to establish that apartheid was indeed a crime against humanity at the time of the alleged conduct.24\n- Federal Court Jurisprudence\n[29] In my view, this conclusion aligns with the rationale expressed by the Federal Court. I do not believe that the decision in Ventocilla stands in contradiction with the subsequent Federal Court decisions on the issue of the retroactive or retrospective application of the Rome Statute. Indeed, in those cases, the Federal Court based their conclusion on additional evidence that, when the reproached conduct occurred prior to the signature of the Rome Statute, the international crimes alleged by the Minister were part of customary international law. The Rome Statute, in and of itself, did not suffice.\n[30] In Ventocilla, the Federal Court declared that the RPD erred when it relied only on the Rome Statute to assume that the alleged war crime could be committed as part of an internal armed conflict, as opposed to an international armed conflict regarding conduct that occurred between 1985 until 1992 in Peru. It implicitly ruled that, since the Rome Statute was not applicable at the time of alleged perpetration, the decision maker needed to ascertain whether such war crimes were part of the laws and customs of war - or customary international law. It relied on the definition of war crimes provided in the CAHWCA that specified that an act or omission is a war crime when \"at the time and in the place of its commission\" it was defined as such by \"customary international law or conventional international law applicable to armed conflicts\".25 Since the Rome Statute was not in force at the time of the conduct, the Minister needed to adduce evidence that it formed part of customary international law. This interpretation is in line with section 6(4) of the CAHWCA, that indicates that for pre-1998 conducts, war crimes described in article 8 of the Rome Statute may be part of customary international law, which is insufficient to meet the legal standard for a question of law.\n[31] In Bonilla, the Federal Court was dealing with torture as a crime against humanity. It opined that, regarding this particular crime, the Rome Statute was a \"consolidation of the traditional definition which was in existence at least since 1945.\" 26 Indeed, as pointed out by the Federal Court of Appeal in the Harb case, this international crime of torture had been recognized as such since at least the trials of Nuremberg in 1945-1946 and other international instruments that came afterwards, including the IMT, ICTY and the Convention against Torture (CAT) of 1984.27 This situation led the Federal Court to declare that, in that regard, the Rome Statute was declaratory of the existence of that crime within customary international law, well before the signature of the Rome Statute. It did not rely solely on the Rome Statute in order to make that finding, but it also considered other older international instruments. The Appellants do not challenge that torture, as a crime against humanity, was part of customary international law prior to 1998.\n[32] In Betoukoumesou, the Federal Court distinguished Ventocilla, as it was dealing with war crimes and not crimes against humanity. However, I do not believe this distinction to be so relevant. In Betoukoumesou, Justice Mosley viewed section 14 of the CAHWRC, as declaratory of the applicable law at the time of the conduct, not the Rome Statute.28 Indeed, the CAHWCA did not proclaim the Rome Statute regime of modes of responsibility set forth in article 25 of the Rome Statute, nor the defense of superior order contained in article 33 of the Rome Statute as a reflection of international customary law. Instead, the Federal Court applied the rationale elaborated in the SCC case Finta in relation to the defence of obedience to superior orders applicable in both war crime and crimes against humanity cases, as it was mostly mirroring section 14 of CAHWCA.29 In my view, this case does not deal with the application of the Rome Statute within the context of an article 1F(a) exclusion.\n[33] Even in the Elve case, the Federal Court rejected Ventocilla, but in fact applied the same rationale, citing extensive evidence as to the existence of torture as a crime against humanity or war crime being part of customary international law before 1998, making the Rome Statute (and section 6 of the CAHWCA) declaratory or prospective.30 It did not rely on the Rome Statute alone to conduct predating its signature. It also cited the Betoukoumesou case which concerns the application of the CAHWCA, not the Rome Statute, but failed to draw a distinction between the inadmissibility regime of section 35 of the IRPA and the one of refugee law of section 98 of IRPA, the latter not requiring the application of the CAHWCA.\n[34] I thus find that the Canadian jurisprudence supports my earlier finding that the Minister was required to adduce additional evidence to establish that the crime of apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was part of customary law at the time of the alleged conduct.\n[35] In his intervention of July 22, 2022, the Minister pleaded that apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was part of customary international law before the signature of the Rome Statute. He relied mainly on the Apartheid Convention of 1973, the first international instrument providing a definition of the crime of apartheid for which individual criminal responsibility could be incurred. However, as revealed by the United Nations Treaty Collection Depository website, Canada never ratified nor signed the Apartheid Convention, neither did its Western counterparts.31 The Minister failed to explain how this was not relevant to the case.\n[36] Consequently, on August 30, 2022, I asked the parties for further submissions to assess whether apartheid, as a crime against humanity, formed part of customary international law between 1990 and 1994 (Second Alazar Notice).\nApartheid as crime against humanity did not form part of customary international law between 1990-1994\n- Procedural Background\n[37] In this Second Alazar Notice, the parties were requested to file further submissions to determine whether apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was part of international customary law at the time of the reproached conduct (1990-1994). The parties were also invited by the RAD to provide submissions on a list of documents annexed to the Second Alazar notice. Abstracts of relevant documents, unavailable online, were also provided by the RAD.\n[38] Following an oral request from the Minister, the Tribunal provided clarifications regarding the new issue on September 21, 2022. It is worth noting that the information then provided could be found in the abstracts and other documents listed in the annex.\n[39] The parties were given another 7 days to provide submissions. On September 22, 2022, the Minister requested an additional 14 days to respond to the new issue. He explained that the new issue further complexified an already complex case and it needed the support of the Ministry of Justice to prepare the submissions. The request was granted.\n- Parties Submissions\n[40] In his supplementary submissions, dated October 7, 2022, the Minister argues that, though the existence of apartheid as a crime against humanity has been the subject of some debate, sufficient evidence supports the allegation that such crime was recognised as a crime against humanity, under customary international law, before the coming into force of the Rome Statute in 2000. According to the Minister, the fact that Canada did not sign the Apartheid Convention is not dispositive of the question. Basing his reasoning on the Nevsun case, he opines that evidence shows the two requirements for a norm of customary international law to be recognized as such are met, namely general practice of States and the belief that such practice amounts to a legal obligation (opinion juris).32 The Minister invoked several international instruments condemning the policies and practice of apartheid that was proclaimed a crime against humanity: (i) three United Nations (UN) General Assembly Resolutions condemning policies of apartheid practised by the Government of South Africa as a crime against humanity in 1965 and 1966; (ii) the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) explicitly requiring State parties to condemn practice of apartheid; (iii) Article I(b) of the 1968 Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity defining apartheid as a crime against humanity; (iv) 1973 Apartheid Convention; (v) the 1977 Additional Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions (AP1) identified practices of apartheid as a grave breach of the treaties; (vi) two UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions stating that apartheid was a crime against humanity; (vii) the 1992 International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind in which apartheid was put \"on par\" with the crime of genocide; (viii) 1996 ILC Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind describing apartheid as a crime against humanity; (ix) ICTY Tadic case; (x) 1966 South West Africa cases, in which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stated that prohibition of racial discrimination is part of customary international law. He opined that those international instruments in which apartheid was condemned by the international community leave little doubt that the crime of apartheid was recognized as a crime against humanity even before the implementation of the Rome Statute. I note that the Minister did not articulate any submission regarding the documents disclosed in the Second Alazar Notice by the tribunal.\n[41] The Associate Appellant replied that apartheid as a crime against humanity, prior to the enactment of the Rome Statute, did not meet the requirements set out by the SCC in the Nevsun case of \"sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent.\" He argued that Canada's failure to ratify both the Apartheid Convention and the ICERD reveals that the Canadian government had the intent not to recognize apartheid as a crime against humanity, as acknowledged by recognized scholars. He cited several of those scholars, including Cassese, Schabas, and Lafontaine who reached the same conclusion after having considered the relevant international instruments. He opined that, though several of those international instruments cited by the Minister recognised apartheid as a crime against humanity, the reluctance of States to include the crime in the Rome Statute during the negotiation phase and the fact that no \"Western States\" have ratified the Apartheid Convention undermined the Minister's allegation that the opinion juris criterion was met.\n- Analysis\n[42] In the context of the international crime of slavery, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), in Nevsun, articulated the following rules underlying the formation of international customary law:\nThere are two requirements for a norm of customary international law to be recognized as such: general but not necessarily universal practice, and opinio juris, namely the belief that such practice amounts to a legal obligation (United Nations, International Law Commission, Report of the International Law Commission, 73rd Sess., Supp. No. 10, U.N. Doc. A\/73\/10, 2018, at p. 124; North Sea Continental Shelf, Judgment, I.C.J. Report 1969, p. 3, at para. 71; Kazemi Estate v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 2014 SCC 62 (CanLII), [2014] 3 S.C.R. 176, at para. 38; Harold Hongju Koh, \"Twenty-First Century International Lawmaking\" (2013), 101 Geo. L.J. 725, at p. 738; Jean-Marie Henckaerts, \"Study on customary international humanitarian law: A contribution to the understanding and respect for the rule of law in armed conflict\" (2005), 87 Int'l Rev. Red Cross 175, at p. 178; Antonio Cassese, International Law (2nd ed. 2005), at p. 157).\nTo meet the first requirement, the practice must be sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent (International Law Commission, at p. 135). To meet the second requirement, opinio juris, the practice \"must be undertaken with a sense of legal right or obligation\", as \"distinguished from mere usage or habit\" (International Law Commission, at p. 138; North Sea Continental Shelf, at para. 77).33 (emphasis added)\n[43] The ICTR Appeals Chamber specified the requirements to determine whether a norm has reached the status of customary international law, in the context of international criminal law:\n14. Norms of customary international law are characterized by the two familiar components of state practice and opinio juris. In concluding that customary international law permitted a conviction for, inter alia, a crime against humanity through participation in a joint criminal enterprise, the Tadic Appeals Judgement held that the recognition of that mode of liability in prosecutions for crimes against humanity and war crimes following World War II constituted evidence of these components. The ICTY Appeals Chamber has placed similar reliance in other cases on proceedings held following World War II, including the proceedings before the International Military Tribunal and before tribunals operating under Allied Control Council Law No. 10 (\"Control Council Law No. 10\"), as indicative of principles of customary international law at that time. For the reasons that follow, the Appeals Chamber concludes that these proceedings, as well as the text and drafting history of the Genocide Convention of 1948, lead to the conclusion that customary international law criminalized intentional participation in a common plan to commit genocide prior to 1992.34 (emphasis added)\n[44] I conclude from that jurisprudence that, in the context of international criminal law, criminalising individual participation in an international crime, the Minister needs to show a sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent State practice in recognizing apartheid as a crime against humanity, for which individual criminal liability can be incurred. This State practice may include the public exercise of executive, legislative, judicial or other functions, including decisions of national courts.35 This needs to be combined with evidence showing that States felt legally bound to implement the practice. As the analysis will show, neither criterion is met in the instant case. Judicial proceedings will have a particular significance in the analysis.\nInternational Instruments\n- UN documents\n[45] The Minister points to the UN General Assembly resolutions of 1965 and 1966 declaring apartheid a crime against humanity, a determination that was endorsed by the UNSC in 1984.36 This determination led the States to impose economic sanctions on the South African government. Indeed, the imposition of a system of apartheid was considered a grave breach of international law posing a great threat to international peace and security, giving rise to State responsibility in the arena of international law. Professor Crawford explained that the maintenance of such regime constitutes an example of peremptory norm whose violation leads to an international crime.37 However, this is distinct from the individual criminal responsibility that can be incurred as a result of one's participation in such crime, which differs from the international responsibility that can be borne by a State.38 None of those UN documents set out a definition of the crime that would allow criminal prosecution to take place while respecting the principle of legality.39\n- Apartheid Convention and other treaties\n[46] In the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of November 26, 1968, the parties condemned the policies of apartheid as crimes against humanity. The Tribunal notes that this Convention was ratified by only 57 countries, and Canada is not one of them, nor are any other Western states.40 I also note that this international instrument does not provide a definition of the crime of apartheid and focuses instead on criminalising the inhumane acts resulting from the policies of apartheid, which probably include murder, torture and persecutions that are recognised as crimes against humanity. I therefore consider the non-ratification of this Convention by Canada and others expresses a State intention not to recognize apartheid as a crime against humanity, leading to individual criminal liability. In my view, this detracts from a sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent State recognition of apartheid as a crime against humanity.\n[47] On November 30, 1973, the Apartheid Convention came into effect and garnered over 100 ratifications. It reiterated that apartheid was considered an international crime, but also provided for the first time a definition of such crime. However, as pointed out by the parties, very few of those States implemented the treaty by prosecuting the crime within their national jurisdictions and the Minister failed to provide evidence that those States implemented the Apartheid Convention in any other way.\n[48] Besides, Canada has still not ratified this Convention, and nor have most Western countries.41 I agree with the Minister that this is not dispositive, in and of itself, but it carries a significant weight, in my view. Indeed, this Convention is the first one that provides a legal definition of the crime, and liberal States championing the application and prosecution of international crimes, either through domestic prosecutions or international supports, failed to recognize it as binding.42 Furthermore, Professor Lafontaine noted that, in a response to the Universal Periodic Review of 2009, Canada responded that it was not considering ratifying this international human rights instrument.43 This is reflected in the absence of apartheid in the list as a crime against humanity in Canadian legislation, at the time of the conduct at issue in this case.44 Canada refused to consider ratifying the Apartheid Convention. It is therefore not a situation of legislative inaction on Canada's part, but rather an express governmental action against the recognition of the Apartheid Convention as a binding treaty.\n[49] The 1965 ICERD received wide support from the international community and is a binding legal instrument. At article 3, States are required to \"condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.\" I note that this provision falls short of qualifying apartheid as a crime against humanity and does not provide a legal definition of the crime. It is not at issue that discrimination and segregation, such as the apartheid policies, are prohibited, but it does not label apartheid as an international crime for which individual criminal liability can be incurred.45\n[50] The AP1, at article 85 (4) c), includes \"practices of apartheid and other inhuman and degrading practices involving outrages upon personal dignity, based on racial discrimination\" as a grave breach that could lead to individual criminal liability. However, a grave breach is considered a war crime, not a crime against humanity, and requires the existence of an armed conflict or a situation of occupation to become applicable, which was not the situation in South Africa during apartheid.46\n- International Law Commission (ILC)\n[51] In 1991, the ILC was charged with preparing a Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind (Draft Code). At that time, the ILC opted to include apartheid in the Draft Code, but to limit its scope rationae personae to \"leaders and organizers\" of the regime.47 Professor Tomuschat, Emeritus of Humboldt University in Berlin, then member of the ILC, highlighted the difference between apartheid as grave violations of human rights and contrary to public international law, and the individual international criminal liability that one can incur as a perpetrator of such crime:\nThere could be no doubt that, as ICJ had found in its advisory opinion concerning the legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia,5 apartheid constituted a denial of fundamental human rights and was therefore contrary to generally accepted rules of international law. However, the Commission was concerned with individual responsibility and the question at issue was therefore whether apartheid was a crime whose perpetrators were liable to incur an international criminal penalty. It had to be admitted that the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid had thus far had only very limited success and that none of the States of one specific region had acceded to it. It was therefore not possible to speak of universally recognized customary law and, that being so, the pacta tertiis nee nocent nee prosunt rule was fully applicable.48 (emphasis added)\n[52] It follows that apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was not included in the 1996 final text of the Draft Code, though it criminalised \"institutionalized discrimination on racial, ethnic or religious grounds\", which was meant to be a broader definition.49 Instead, the practices of apartheid were criminalised as a war crime.50 In my view, this does not show a uniform State practice of criminalising apartheid as a crime against humanity. This militates against the allegation that apartheid, as a crime against humanity for which individual criminal liability could be incurred, was part of international customary law at the time of the reproached conduct.\n- Academics\n[53] In 2008, Professor Cassese stated that apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was not part of customary international law at the time the Rome Statute was signed.51 He later acknowledged, in 2013, that its inclusion in the Rome Statute \"might facilitate the formation of a customary rule.\"52\n[54] In 2014, Eden, a lecturer at the University of Sussex, concluded that, based on its history and the principle of legality, apartheid, as a crime against humanity, giving rise to individual responsibility prior to 1998, was not part of customary international law. In 2015, Lingaas, a PhD candidate at the Faculty of Law of the University of Oslo, based on the widespread mention of apartheid as a crime against humanity in different international instruments, reached the opposite conclusion. In my view, Eden was correct when he drew a distinction between the condemnation of apartheid as a crime against humanity violating international law, and its becoming an international crime indictable in a court of law. Lingaas failed to make this distinction, though she recognized that such a crime had never been charged in any criminal proceedings.53 She also mistakenly stated that Canada had added apartheid as a crime against humanity in its legislation, which is only partially true, as it was done through the incorporation of the Rome Statute into the domestic legislation, but not included directly as such.54\n[55] This approach was also elaborated in an article by Julia Gebhard, published under the auspices of the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law. After pointing to different instruments declaring the prohibition of apartheid as a peremptory norm or ius cogens for which State responsibility can be incurred, she recognized that State practice has been insufficient to meet the criteria necessary for individual criminal responsibility for the same crime to be part of customary international law.55\n[56] Mettraux admitted that \"the only genuine remaining objection to recognizing the customary law status of apartheid as a category of crimes against humanity pertains to the adequacy of its definitional outline.\"56 He added that the definition of this crime will likely crystallise around the definition provided in the Rome Status, which reads \"inhumane acts and the suppression of the rights committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression, discrimination and domination by a racial group over another with the intention of maintaining that regime\".57 This, in the author's view, means that apartheid is now criminalized as part of customary law through the 1998 Rome Statute. Hence, it became an indictable offense when it became part of the Rome Statute, but not before.\n[57] Professor Schabas detailed the process under which the crime of apartheid became part of the Rome Statute. In the Report of the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court of 1996, the crime of apartheid was listed under \"treaty crimes\" along with illicit drug trafficking. The State parties also discussed that it could be included as a war crime, as opposed to being featured under the heading \"crime against humanity\".58 This situation evolved during the Rome Conference, as Professor Schabas explained:\nDuring the Rome Conference, Mexico proposed adding apartheid to the list of crimes against humanity. There was broad support for this, but also substantial opposition. A written amendment was submitted, entitled: 'Institutionalized racial discrimination, including the practices of apartheid.' A similar proposal was made with respect to the war crimes provision. The crime of apartheid was incorporated within the enumeration of crimes against humanity in the Bureau Discussion Paper of 6 July 1998 without any subsequent objection.59 (emphasis added)\n[58] I conclude that the work of the academics, at the very least, exposes the uncertainty of the status of apartheid as an indictable international offense, which militates against its forming part of customary international law as a result of the failure to meet the requirement of a sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent State practice.\n- Judicial State Practice\n[59] The crime of apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was prosecuted for the first time in South Africa in 2021.60 Indeed, the South African authorities opted for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to deal with past human rights violations committed during the apartheid regime that was instituted in 1948 and completely dismantled by 1994.61 While most of those who admitted their crimes were granted amnesty, only 800 cases were forwarded to the Public Prosecution Office for further investigations.62\n[60] Before then, as repeatedly observed in the academia, such a crime was never indicted nor tried, whether at the national or international levels.63 Though it seems that some national jurisdictions incorporated this crime into their national jurisdictions, the extent of such incorporation remains unclear and unambitious.64 It is therefore safe to say that, in practice, the implementation of the crime of apartheid as a crime against humanity, for which individuals could be indicted, remained marginal. This lack of judicial State practice militates against a finding that apartheid was part of customary international law at the time of the reproached conduct of the Associate Appellant.\n- Conclusion\n[61] Consequently, I find that the two requirements for the crime of apartheid to be part of customary international law, namely the general and uniform State practice as well as the opinion juris, are not met because: (i) the UN international instruments qualifying apartheid as a crime against humanity lead to economic sanctions, but failed to provide a legal definition of the crime to make it an indictable offense; (ii) that Canada and other like-minded countries failed to ratify the Apartheid Convention and other treaties dealing with the criminalisation of apartheid; (iii) that it was not listed within the CAHWCA definition of crimes against humanity; (iv) that members of the ILC acknowledged that it did not form part of customary international law as an indictable offence during their exchanges between 1991-1996; (v) that some States still opposed its featuring in the Rome Statute as a crime against humanity up to 1998; and (vi) that it was not prosecuted until after the adoption of the Rome Statute. I am therefore of the opinion that, between 1990 and 1994, the crime of apartheid, as a crime against humanity, as defined in article 7 of the Rome Statute, as well as the Elements of the Crime, did not form part of customary international law. Despite this conclusion, the evidence, including the UN documents and different treaties discussed above, clearly shows that, by imposing the apartheid regime, South Africa was violating a peremptory norm resulting in an international crime and thereby engaging its international responsibility as a State.\nMurder and Torture as Crimes against Humanity were Committed in South Africa between 1990 and 1994\n[62] The Minister argues that other crimes against humanity could be identified to have been committed during the apartheid regime, including murder and torture as a crime against humanity. The Associate Appellant does not contest that there are serious reasons to consider that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX(XXXX) committed those crimes during apartheid, nor that they existed as part of customary international law between 1990-1994. He submits that, as a member of the XXXX, he did not participate in those crimes and that finding otherwise would be based on his mere membership in the group, which is contrary to the Ezokola jurisprudence.\n[63] The Minister alleges that the crimes of murder and torture formed part of the international customary law system at the time of the alleged conduct.65 Indeed, both international crimes were listed in the IMT, Control Council Number 10, ICTY and ICTR Statutes and prosecuted at both national and international levels. The RAD agrees with those allegations and notes that the Appellants did not object. The tribunal therefore finds that both international crimes were part of the international customs between 1990-1994, based on the reasoning put forward by the Minister in his Additional Memorandum.\n[64] The Minister pleads that the acts committed by the XXXXamounted to murder and torture as crimes against humanity during the time of the reproached conduct, namely between 1990 and 1994. The Appellants seem to allege that the RPD and the Minister failed to conduct or submit a proper analysis of the Mugesera test, arguing that they lack references to a particular timeframe.\n[65] In the Mugesera case, the SCC distilled the following elements for crimes against humanity to be established:\n1. An enumerated proscribed act was committed (this involves showing that the accused committed the criminal act and had the requisite guilty state of mind for the underlying act);\n2. The act was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack;\n3. The attack was directed against any civilian population or any identifiable group of persons; and\n4. The person committing the proscribed act knew of the attack and knew or took the risk that his or her act comprised a part of that attack.66\n- Proscribed Acts or Conduct\n[66] The Minister alleges that the RPD rightfully found that the following acts were perpetrated as part of a widespread and systematic attack between 1990 and 1994:\n(1) widespread torture by the police; evidence of widespread ill-treatment by the police. This included widespread evidence of the police's involvement in the mistreatment of suspects;\n(2) police involvement in killing and executions. This included widespread evidence of the killing of African National Congress (ANC) supporters;\n(3) the police's key role in upholding apartheid, a general institution creating a separate system designed to uphold the privilege and power of the White minority. In this regard it was systematic, in addition to being widespread as it was perpetrated by the police against the Black population throughout South Africa.\n[67] Indeed, the evidence shows that the XXXX, mainly through the security forces division, were involved in committing such crimes. Here are some factual illustrations:\nEvents of 1990\n* Security forces were implicated in the killings of more than 1000 South Africans in the townships of Johannesburg. On March 26, 1990, the police killed 17 Black protesters in Sebokeng.67 [emphasis added]\nEvents of 1991\n* At least 217 opposition activists were detained under the Internal Security Act permitting the indefinite detention without charge of suspects. Some were reported to have been tortured.68\n* The police and military Special Forces units were widely alleged to have taken part in political assassinations and to have assisted those responsible for such killings. The police were also alleged to have acted in a biased manner in favour of the LFP and against the ANC by failing to protect ANC supporters from attack, and by not investigating killings or bringing those responsible to justice. The government denied these allegations, but a growing body of evidence emerged during the year which pointed to official responsibility for or acquiescence in a series of political killings, largely of ANC supporters.69\nEvents of 1992\n* More than 3000 people killed in Natal, many of them victims of security forces action in the fighting between supports of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and ANC. The worst incident occurred on June 17 where 49 people were killed, including children by IFP supporters. New evidence showed that covert security forces were involved in those killings.70\n* There were reports of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, with at least 121 deaths in custody in suspicious circumstances, despite the government guidelines prohibiting torture.71\nEvents of 1993\n* By the end of October 1993, a total of 3521 people were killed in political attacks as a result of the conflict between ANC and IFP.72\n* Police misconduct, including the indiscriminate use of lethal force in crowd control, and the torture and ill-treatment of individuals in police detention, remained routine during 1993. According to the HRC, 115 people were killed in actions by the security forces, and thirty-five people died in police custody in South Africa in 1993 up to the end of October. One of the most noteworthy incidents of bad crowd policing occurred in April, when police fired on a demonstration in Soweto protesting the death of Chris Hani, killing four people.73\nEvents of 1994\n* The security forces remained powerful and largely autonomous, despite profound changes;\n* the year 1994 was a turning point with the entry into force of the Interim Constitution and the Bill of Fundamental Rights. The provision of the Security Act allowing for indefinite detention without charge was repealed. Nevertheless, politically motivated killings persisted through the year. The number of unexplained deaths in police custody continued at a high level.\n* A pattern of police torture of detainees in the Vaal Triangle area of Johannesburg was revealed.74\n* A total of 94 extrajudicial killings were computed in 1994.75 The majority of those killings were a result of the conflict opposing the ANC to the IFA. The Goldstone Commission continued to show that the IFA was supported by coveted operations conducted by the security forces.76\n[68] The RPD also correctly considered evidence to the effect that the South African government established a system aiming at the separation based on race, discriminatory against the non-White population. Based on the foregoing, I rule that the RPD correctly found that the XXXXcommitted acts of murder and torture as crimes against humanity between 1990 and 1994, and that those acts were perpetrated in the context of a regime of systemic oppression and domination by the White South Africans against the non-White population.\n- Widespread and Systematic Attack Against the Population\n[69] The Minister argues that the chapeau requirement of crimes against humanity, namely the widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population, was constituted by the imposition of the system of apartheid, referring to the Mugesera case. The Appellants did not contest this allegation or RPD finding.\n[70] The regime aimed at segregating a portion of the population based on race through the violations of their human rights which constitutes, in my view, an attack against the civilian population, namely against the non-White South Africans. The ICTR in the Akayesu Trial Judgement held that the \"attack\" can also be comprised of non-violent acts, like the imposition of an apartheid regime:\n581. The concept of 'attack' may be defined as an unlawful act of the kind enumerated in Article 3(a) to (I) of the Statute, like murder, extermination, enslavement, etc. An attack may also be non-violent in nature, like imposing a system of apartheid, which is declared a crime against humanity in Article 1 of the Apartheid Convention of 1973 or exerting pressure on the population to act in a particular manner, may come under the purview of an attack, if orchestrated on a massive scale or in a systematic manner.77 [emphasis added]\n[71] This definition of an attack was later followed by the ICTY that explicitly recognized that this notion also includes mistreatments of the civilian population:\nAn 'attack' may be defined as a course of conduct involving the commission of acts of violence. In the context of crimes against humanity, an 'attack' is distinct from the concept of 'armed conflict' and not limited to the use of armed force. Rather, it may encompass any mistreatment of the civilian population. The attack may precede, outlast or continue during the armed conflict and need not be part of it.78\n[72] I understand that the ICC in the Ntaganda case rejected this approach to the application of the explicit requirement that the attack must include acts listed under article 7 of the Rome Statute. 79 However, since I am not applying the ICC definition of crimes against humanity, but rather the one hailing from customary international law, I will apply the jurisprudence of the ICTY\/ICTR and consider that the policy of apartheid formed part of the widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population.\n[73] I note the Minister's submissions at paragraphs 52 to 56 of his Additional Memorandum regarding the requirement that the attack be carried out in furtherance of a state or organizational policy was not part of customary international law, at least prior to the 1998 Rome Statute. As it was already discussed above, the RAD does not consider the Rome Statute to be a full codification of the customary international law at the time of its signature, in application of the SCC jurisprudence.80 However, it is not disputed that, the apartheid regime in South Africa was a state policy, openly codified through state legislation.81 I therefore find that, regardless of whether or not the requirement of a state or organizational policy was part of customary international law prior to 1998, the issue is not determinative in this case.\n[74] I therefore find that murder and torture were perpetrated as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a portion of the South African population, namely the non-White South Africans, between 1990 and 1994, by the XXXX.\nActus Reus and Mens Rea of Complicity as a Mode of Responsibility of an International Crime\n- RPD Findings\n[75] The RPD found that the Associate Appellant knowingly and voluntarily provided a significant contribution to the crime of apartheid through his employment as a XXXXof the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Regarding the actus reus of the mode of responsibility, it found that for four years, the Associate Appellant \"helped create openings for other positions that would further the organization's more brutal purposes\" and that he was \"involved with specifically arrested criminals\" who would be handed off to the detective unit that perpetrated widespread torture to suspects.82 Finally, it considered that assisting the XXXX in its goal, \"even its goals that were unrelated to maintaining the apartheid, nonetheless did assist them in their overall goal of maintaining apartheid\", which was found to be the basis of the Associate Appellant's \"significant contribution\". For the mens rea, the RPD found that, since the Associate Appellant worked for the XXXX on a voluntary basis, it led to the conclusion that the voluntary criterion was met. Regarding the requirement of knowledge, the RPD considered that the Appellant had been reckless as to whether his actions would further the role of the XXXX in implementing the apartheid policies, citing the Hadhiri case.\n- Parties' Submissions\n[76] In their supplementary submissions, both parties addressed this issue.\n[77] The Associate Appellant argues that the RPD's findings to exclude him were based merely on the fact that he had been a XXXX XXXX during the apartheid era, a finding akin to guilt by association. He contends that the SCC eliminated the \"guilt by association\" approach in Ezokola. He insists that a link between him and the criminal purpose of the group must be established and that he made a \"significant contribution\" to the criminal purpose, not just \"a contribution.\" In application of the Verbanov case, he opines that the RPD \"shifted its focus towards the criminal activities of the group and way from the individual's contribution to that criminal activity.\" Finally, he contests the RPD's finding to the effect that the Associate Appellant's recklessness as to whether his actions constituted part of the crime against humanity to be sufficient. He argues that the Hadhiri case must be distinguished, as it involved a high-ranking employee of the Tunisian Ministry of Interior, holding a supervisory role, who failed to look into whether torture was practised as part of the Ministry. He insists that, contrary to that case, he had a low-level position XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in a branch that was dedicated to serving the community. Finally, he contests the negative credibility findings regarding the unreasonable use of force that he might have witnessed while working in the XXXX XXXX.\n[78] In his Reply to the Minister's Additional Memorandum of November 22, 2022, he reiterates that the Minister relies on his mere membership in the group to allege his complicity in the crimes against humanity, which stands against the holding in Ezokola. He refers to the Federal Court Eriator case in which it was found that being the member of the Nigerian police force was insufficient to a conclusion of significant contribution and akin to guilt by association or passive acquiescence.83 He also suggests that, even if the imposition of apartheid is accepted to constitute \"an attack\", it is irrelevant to his case, as he was born decades after the system was put in place and he joined the XXXXwhile it was in the process of transformation and remained employed after the apartheid era.\n[79] The Minister argues that the RPD correctly concluded that the Associate Appellant knowingly made a voluntary and significant contribution to the crimes and the criminal purpose of the XXXX. He argues that the XXXXhad no legitimacy as a XXXX XXXX, since its role was limited to enforce the apartheid laws and to make sure that the system would continue. He opines that the RPD correctly found that he provided a substantial contribution to the goal of the XXXX, namely the implementation of the apartheid regime. The Minister submits that, contrary to the Associate Appellant's arguments, recklessness is enough to find a person \"knowingly\" contributed to a criminal common purpose, in light of the Ezokola case. Finally, he contends that it was reasonable for the RPD to find that it was implausible that the Associate Appellant did not know of the XXXXcriminal activities. In his Additional Memorandum, the Minister relies on the RPD findings regarding apartheid as a crime against humanity to support his position that the Associate Appellant significantly and knowingly contributed to the crimes of murder and torture as crimes against humanity.\n- Analysis\n[80] In the Ezokola case, the SCC provides a guide to assess \"whether an individual has voluntarily made a significant and knowing contribution to a crime or criminal purpose.\"84 From this statement, I understand the actus reus to be comprised of \"a significant contribution to the criminal purpose or crimes\" and the mental element to have contributed in a \"knowingly and voluntary\" manner. After a long study of the applicable customary international law, including the jurisprudence of the ICC, ICTY and ICTR, as well as other national jurisdictions, the SCC listed a series of factors against which the IRB should assess the actus reus and mens rea of the modes of responsibility:\n(i) the size and nature of the organization;\n(ii) the part of the organization with which the refugee claimant was most directly concerned;\n(iii) the refugee claimant's duties and activities within the organization;\n(iv) the refugee claimant's position or rank in the organization;\n(v) the length of time the refugee claimant was in the organization, particularly after acquiring knowledge of the group's crime or criminal purpose; and\n(vi) the method by which the refugee claimant was recruited and the refugee claimant's opportunity to leave the organization.\n[81] I find the RPD's analysis confusing: it first assessed the above-listed factors, without reaching an overall conclusion, and then moved on to determine the \"three-prong\" Ezokola test that includes whether the appellant made a \"voluntary and knowingly significant contribution\" to further the common criminal purpose, but without considering its previous assessment of the factors. According to my understanding, the SCC put forward those factors against which the Board must assess whether the appellant made a \"voluntary and knowingly significant contribution\" to the alleged crimes. These are not two separate exercises. Also, the RPD rendered its decision orally, which did not provide a clear structure to this complex analysis.\n[82] This tribunal found that the underlying acts perpetrated by the XXXXincluded murder and torture as crimes against humanity, but that the attack against the civilian population consisted, inter alia, of the imposition of the system of apartheid by the South African governmental apparatus that included the XXXX. The system of apartheid was therefore part of the common unlawful purpose imposed by the South African government. Indeed, though the tribunal found that individual criminal responsibility for apartheid was probably not part of customary international law at the time of the conduct, there is no doubt that pursuing this policy was a violation of peremptory norm by South Africa, constituting an international crime at State level.85 In Ezokola, the SCC specified that, in the context of the application of article 1F(a), \"there must be serious reasons for considering that the claimant has voluntarily made a significant and knowing contribution to the organization's crime or criminal purpose.\"86\nThe RPD erred in finding that the contribution of the Associate Appellant was significant\n[83] I believe that the RPD erred when omitting to assess the significance of the impact of the Associate Appellant's acts and conduct on the overall criminal purpose consisting of apartheid and on the crimes against humanity of murder and torture. In my view, it conflated the \"knowledge\" with the \"significant contribution\" of the Associate Appellant to the crimes committed by the XXXXand the overall implementation of the system of apartheid. I find that it also erred when it found that, by discharging his duties, he helped create openings for other positions that would further the organization's more brutal purposes. This, in my view, is dangerously close to participation through membership, since, arguably, everyone's work in the organisation allows the others to accomplish their own. Though the evidence shows that the XXXXplayed a prominent role in implementing apartheid through repressive measures, the institution was of a mix nature and the evidence needs to show more than just a mere membership to the XXXXto result in a conclusion that the RPD also mistakenly took into account the Associate Appellant's testimony that he had been \"involved with specifically arrested criminals\" in 1997 and 1998, as those events clearly fall outside of the reproached conduct period of 1990-1994 under the apartheid regime.87\n[84] I also note that this RPD conclusion was the result of the application of the Federal Court jurisprudence of the Hadhiri and Uriol Castro cases that applied the reasoning of the Rutayisire case:\nAny realistic approach to state-sanctioned crimes against humanity and genocide must acknowledge that the circle of complicity is much broader than simply those directly ordering or carrying out violent acts. It should properly encompass those who, with knowledge of the crimes being perpetrated, acted or acquiesced in administrative positions that facilitated violence and normalized brutality.88\n[85] When it comes to the actus reus of the complicity, namely the \"significant contribution\" of the appellant to the crime, it is imperative to assess the impact of possible assistance on the commission of the underlying crimes. The SCC was adamant in the Ezokola case:\nThat said, even for groups with a limited and brutal purpose, the individual's conduct and role within the organization must still be carefully assessed, on an individualized basis, to determine whether the contribution was voluntarily made and had a significant impact on the crime or criminal purpose.89 [emphasis added]\n[86] I find that the RPD erred in relying on the holding in the Rutayisire case to conclude that the Associate Appellant's contribution raised to the level of significant. The assessment of the significance of the contribution is fact intensive and one must avoid directly applying a rationale that was clearly elaborated to suit a different context. I note that the facts of the Rutayisire case, rendered before the Ezokola case, involved the commission of the genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity in Rwanda in 1994, during which 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were brutally killed in four months, between April 1994 until July 1994.90 Mr. Rutayisire was holding a high-ranking position within the administration as sous-pr\u00e9fet in the Butare prefecture during the massacres and was in charge of travel passes and military escorts that could directly save people's lives. The Federal Court relied on specific expert evidence of Alison Des Forges filed in the ICTR Butare case to establish how Mr. Rutayisire, when discharging his administrative duties, could not ignore the impact of his conduct to the commission of the acts of genocide, where his administrative acts could have a direct impact on whether a person would live or die, in the particular context of the Rwandan genocide.91 Though the Federal Court broadened this rationale to all state-sanctioned crimes against humanity in the Hadhiri and Uriol Castro cases, I believe that it is important not to apply the same reasoning to different contexts without the proper adjustments, including the impact of the alleged contribution of the appellant on the furtherance of the criminal purpose.92 As contended by the Associate Appellant, both the Hadhiri and Uriol Castro cases also involved individuals that held high-ranking positions within their respective units.93 I do not believe that the situation in South Africa between 1990 and 1994 compares to the high-level intensity of the massacres that took place between April and July 1994 in Rwanda. The direct link between Mr. Rutayisire and the possibility that his administrative actions could save lives contrasts with the far-removed connection between the Appellant and the epicentre of international crimes committed by the XXXX. I find that the RPD erred in applying a general statement meant to fit a different situation, without analysing the actual impact of the alleged conduct on the commission of the crimes and the furtherance of the illegal purpose.\n[87] I will thus proceed with my own analysis of the significant contribution of the Associate Appellant to the crime against humanity of murder and torture in light of the Ezokola factors to determine whether his alleged contribution was significant, knowing and voluntary.\n(i) The Size and Nature of the Organization\n[88] The RPD considered that, due to its limited and brutal purpose of maintaining apartheid, this factor \"pointed\" towards complicity, even in light of the large size of the XXXXand the fact that it carried out both criminal and legitimate functions. However, as it was noted by the RPD, the XXXXcounted more than 100,000 members, both XXXX XXXX XXXX. I note document\nM-10 reporting that the XXXXlacked legitimacy and functioned as an instrument of control of political opponents, while poorly equipped for crime control and prevention. M-20 states that the XXXXwas designed to be a paramilitary force, not a civilian force, especially regarding Black South Africans. However, Document M-14 describes the XXXX, with its different divisions and functions. Though the XXXXwere not structured like a regular XXXX XXXX characterizing a democratic system, it did fulfill tasks that aimed at general \"conventional\" policing, including investigating frauds, providing child protection, discharging some level of crime prevention proactive policing functions. I consider therefore the XXXXto be of a mix nature.\n[89] As it was outlined by the SCC in paragraph 94 of the Ezokola case, \"if the organization is multifaceted or heterogenous, i.e. one that performs both legitimate and criminal acts, the link between the contribution and the criminal purpose will be more tenuous.\" Consequently, I find that the size and mixed nature of the overall organization of the XXXXconstitute such a structure that it provides a tenuous link between the Associate Appellant's conduct, as a XXXX inXXXX XXXX XXXXassigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the crimes committed by the Security Forces or the common purpose of implementing the apartheid by the South African government.\n(ii) The Part of the Organization with which the Appellant Was Most Directly Concerned\n[90] It is worth emphasizing that the particular division of the XXXX that concerned the Associate Appellant, namely the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, performed day-to-day operations and comprised of around 900 XXXX XXXX around the country.94 Its functions included: the administration XXXX XXXX XXXX, crime prevention, investigation of certain categories of crime, and all other XXXX XXXX which fall outside the ambit of the other branches.95 Though the XXXX XXXX was used to implement the apartheid regime as a national policy, so was the entire governmental apparatus at the time of the alleged criminal conduct. There was no evidence that pointed at crimes that had been committed by this particular branch, as opposed to the Security and Operational branches that were responsible for murder, execution, torture and crowd control operations.96 This militates against a finding that the Associate Appellant significantly contributed to the crimes of murder and torture as crimes against humanity and the overall illegal implementation of the apartheid regime.\n(iii) The Appellant's Duties and Activities, Position and Rank\n[91] The Associate Appellant carried no executive or supervisory role within the XXXX from 1990 until 1994. In fact, the evidence shows that he was a simple XXXX who was assigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX from members of the population. There is no evidence to suggest that he refused to accept complaints from Black individuals or that he was involved in any illegal detention or arrests that resulted in torture. As articulated earlier, the RPD mistakenly took into consideration arrests that the Associate Appellant conducted in the years post-apartheid. The fact that by discharging his duties he was making room for others to possibly contribute is clearly insufficient to elevate \"possible\" contribution to the crimes to the level of \"significant\" to furthering the common illegal objective. As reiterated by the Federal Court in the Eriator case: \"Mere membership or failure to dissociate from a multifaceted organization do not find complicity. Contrary to what is implied by the IAD, guilt by association or passive acquiescence will not do.\"97\n[92] As stated before, I cannot subscribe to the reasoning that by fulfilling his duties, he was allowing the other branches to carry out the crimes, the Appellant was significantly contributing to the common purpose. I believe this link to be too stretched out and dangerously close to encompassing anyone working for the XXXX, leading to guilt by association.\n(iv) The Length of Time the Appellant Was in the Organization, particularly after Acquiring Knowledge of the Group's Crime or Criminal Purpose\n[93] Considering that the South African illegal regime had received constant condemnation from the international community since 1949, but most importantly through the UN Convention against the crime of Apartheid in 1973, it would be difficult to imagine that the Associate Appellant had no knowledge of the crimes committed by the South African government, including the police force. There was also the establishment of the Goldstone Commission in 1990 that was set up to investigate the alleged crimes, and more specifically those perpetrated by the Security Forces.98 I agree with the RPD that, considering the nature of the political regime in place, the Associate Appellant could not ignore that crimes were being committed by the XXXXover the years. This general knowledge is not sufficient to support a finding that there were serious reasons to believe that the Associate Appellant made a knowing significant contribution to the crimes against humanity. I note in particular that the Associate Appellant remained an employee of the XXXXafter the dismantling of apartheid in 1994, which could militate against a finding that he knew (or even desired) to contribute to the maintaining of the apartheid regime through his employment as a XXXX XXXX.\n(v) The Method by which the Refugee Claimant Was Recruited and the Opportunity He Had to Leave the Organization\n[94] This concerns the voluntary requirement of the mode of responsibility. I agree with the RPD's reasoning that the Associate Appellant was never under duress or forced to remain in the police force and that he joined the force voluntarily. In fact, this finding was not contested by the Associate Appellant. This could militate in favour of a contribution to the common purpose.\nConclusion as to the Appellant's Significant Contribution to Committing Apartheid\n[95] I believe that, based on the Associate Appellant's rank, duties, size of the organization and the department in which he was hired, the Minister failed to establish that there were serious reasons to consider that the Appellant significantly contributed to the common purpose of apartheid or to the crimes against humanity of torture and murder while he was employed by the XXXX.\n[96] The RPD reasoned that, by fulfilling his duties for four years, he allowed the other departments to commit the crime of apartheid. I believe the possible link between the Associate Appellant's duties and the crimes committed by another department of 100,000 strong force over the course of four years to be rather tenuous and too close to a \"guilt by association\", especially in light of his low rank and assignment to a branch that, according to the evidence submitted by the Minister, was not directly involved in the crimes recorded by Amnesty International and other NGOs.\n[97] I also note that this RPD holding was reliant on the finding that the XXXXwere one of the \"key drivers\" in charge of implementing the apartheid, which the RPD believed was not the case of every government institution that existed during the apartheid. I believe that this consideration ignores the relevant objective evidence on the topic contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP). Indeed, the whole governmental apparatus was involved in implementing the policy, including the education system, the financial network, the business and judiciary sectors. They all aimed at maintaining the privilege of the minority White population over the majority Black population with the socio-economic and legal discriminatory system, through repressive means used by the security forces or members of the justice system, though clearly the police force remained an important tool in the forced implementation of the policies of apartheid and repression.99 Also, the evidence shows that the acts of murder as crimes against humanity mostly took place between the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and African National Congress (ANC), while the security services were found to have supported those crimes through coveted operations. The crimes of torture were mostly perpetrated in prisons and during investigations, in which the Associate Appellant did not participate. I find that the Associate Appellant's duties were too far removed from the epicenter of those involved in the international crimes to have significantly contributed to them.\n[98] Consequently, I find that the RPD erred and that the Minister did not meet his burden of proof of establishing that there were serious reasons to consider that the Associate Appellant had provided a \"significant contribution\" to the illegal common purpose of implementing apartheid or of any of the crime against humanity put forward by the Minister, including murder and torture. I consider this finding to be the determinative issue regarding the exclusion in this case.\n[99] In a subsidiary manner, I will also address the mental element issue of \"recklessness\", even if it is not determinative, as I already found that the evidence does not show a \"significant contribution\" of the Associate Appellant.\nRecklessness: mens rea for mode of responsibility in international criminal law\n[100] The RPD found that it was sufficient to find that the Associate Appellant was reckless as to whether his actions would have significantly contributed to crimes against humanity of murder and torture. The Minister underlines the holding of the SCC to the effect that \"recklessness\" is an acceptable subjective awareness linking the Associate Appellant to those crimes, so therefore the RPD's finding is correct. The Associate Appellant submits that, according to the test of Ezokola, knowledge remains an important factor in determining complicity.\n[101] I agree with the Associate Appellant on this issue. The Minister refers to paragraph 68 of the Ezokola Judgement to support his position that recklessness is sufficient in the context of exclusion under article 1Fa) of the Convention. However, I note that this paragraph is located under the heading \"Summary of Complicity Under International Law\", and constitutes a preliminary finding, as opposed to the finding regarding the mens rea test finally adopted by the SCC at paragraphs 89-90 of the Judgement:\nTo be complicit in crimes committed by the government, the official must be aware of the government's crime or criminal purpose and aware that his or her conduct will assist in the furtherance of the crime or criminal purpose.\nIn our view, this approach is consistent with the mens rea requirement under art. 30 of the Rome Statute. Article 30(1) explains that \"a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge\". Article 30(2)(a) explains that a person has intent where he \"means to engage in the conduct\". With respect to consequences, art. 30(2)(b) requires that the individual \"means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events\". Knowledge is defined in art. 30(3) as \"awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events\".\n[102] As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), the International Criminal Court most likely rejected recklessness as being insufficient to meet the threshold of article 30 of the Rome Statute.100 When summarising the doctrine of the third form of Joint Criminal Enterprise (JCE III) elaborated by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda (ICTY and ICTR or ad hoc Tribunals), the SCC mainly relied on the Tadic and Brdanin Appeals Judgements.101 As pointed out in Ezokola, JCE III, according to the ad hoc tribunals, requires a finding that the accused shared the intent of the participants to the common plan. Only then can the mens rea of recklessness regarding the foreseeable crimes, namely those that were not part of the common plan, be applied.102 JCE III is a form of principle liability, not an accessory.103 In my view, this is very important, as the accessory doctrine of aiding and abetting, that could allow for the mens rea of recklessness in international customary law, requires a higher level of contribution to the crimes or to the common plan to result in criminal liability.104 Such contribution must have a \"substantial\" effect over the crimes or common plan, as opposed to only be significant.105\n[103] The actus reus of \"significant contribution\" combined to a mens rea of \"recklessness\", divorced from any finding of intent to participate in the common criminal purpose, as a form of participation in an international crime, was considered insufficient to result in criminal liability by the ad hoc tribunals. Responding to concerns raised by the Brdanin Defence Team, the ICTY Appeals Chamber reiterated, in the excerpt cited by the SCC in Ezokola, that a finding of intent to participate in the common plan is necessary for the significant contribution to result in a criminal liability, in order to avoid guilt by association.106 This interpretation concurs with the one of the Refugee Convention by the UNHRC's recommendation requiring that a substantial contribution of the asylum claimant to the international crimes be established with his or her knowledge that his or her act or omission would facilitate the criminal conduct in the context of an article 1F(a) analysis.107 This corresponds to the material and mental elements of aiding and abetting, not the ones of JCE III.\n[104] In short, the common Appeals Chambers of the ICTY and ICTR teach us that, for recklessness to be accepted as mens rea standard, the Minister needs to prove that the Appellant intended to participate in the furtherance of the common purpose. It follows that the RPD erred in applying the recklessness standard to the instant case without a finding that the Associate Appellant shared the intent to participate in the furtherance of the common plan, namely the imposition of apartheid, or that his alleged contribution had a substantial effect over crimes against humanity of murder and torture.108\n[105] The SCC requires that the Canadian jurisprudence and legislation be construed in such a way that it is not in conflict with Canada's international obligations.109 In my view, the analysis of the SCC elaborated in paragraphs 62 to 68 of the Ezokola judgement constitutes a summary of the different modes of liability recognized by the ad hoc tribunals to determine whether guilt by association was an accepted form of liability in international customary law: its conclusion is not operative or meant to be directly applied to the 1F(a) cases. Paragraphs 84 to 90 contain the operative findings of the SCC, that rejects the application of recklessness as a mens rea in application of article 30 of the Rome Statute.\n[106] I believe that the Federal Court in Hadhiri misconstrued Ezokola. Indeed, it considered that paragraph 68 of Ezokola permitted \"to find individuals guilty of complicity under international law if they have knowingly or recklessly made a significant contribution to a crime or criminal purpose of the group to which they are associated.\"110 This interpretation is misleading as it fails to reflect international customary law standards.\n[107] I therefore conclude that the RPD erred when it found that recklessness was sufficient to meet the mental requirement for participation in international customary law and, therefore, that the Associate Appellant recklessly participated in the crimes against humanity of murder and torture or in furthering the illegal common purpose.\n[108] I already found that I do not believe that the alleged contribution of the Associate Appellant rose to the level of \"significant\". Even if it did, the Minister did not adduce sufficient evidence to support a finding that there were serious reasons for considering that the Associate Appellant, through his position as a XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, knowingly contributed to the commission of crimes against humanity (murder or torture), or to the implementation of the apartheid policy as an illegal common purpose of the South African governmental apparatus. Indeed, his duties were too far removed from the alleged crimes against humanity. Nothing reveals that he would know he was contributing to them, even if he was aware that the XXXXwere committing those crimes. Also, since all government apparatus were implementing the policy of apartheid, everyone in the government was contributing to this illegal common purpose. I understand that the police force was particularly involved in implementing the policy, but nothing reveals that the Associate Appellant's branch was directly involved in the perpetration of those crimes, like, for instance, the Security Forces.\n[109] Consequently, I am of the opinion that the RPD erred in excluding the Associate Appellant from the refugee protection regime pursuant to article 1F(a) of the Convention either because the Minister failed to establish serious reasons to consider that the Associate Appellant significantly contributed to crimes against humanity or, alternatively, that he knowingly contributed to the crimes or common plan. I am therefore reversing this conclusion and will assess whether Mr. XXXXqualifies as a Convention refugee as alleged and found by the RPD.\nThe RPD Was Correct when It Found that the Appellants Were not Convention Refugees\n[110] The RPD found that the Appellants testified in a credible manner. However, their allegations remained unsupported by the country condition evidence that, instead, indicated that crimes alleged were economically, as opposed to racially motivated. The RPD considered that, though evidence pointed at some instances of crimes directed against White South Africans that were racially motivated, the objective evidence indicates that the vast majority of crimes against the White population are not so. All in all, the RPD acknowledged the genuine subjective fear of the Appellants of returning to their birth country, but ruled that there was a lack of evidence underpinning their allegation of an objective basis of that fear. Finally, it decided that the Appellants would face the same risk linked to generalised criminality plaguing the South African society as a whole, which does not allow for granting protection under section 97 of IRPA.\n[111] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred when it assessed whether there was a serious possibility that they would be subjected to one of the specific types of crimes that are included in the country conditions evidence, instead of assessing whether they would be subject to persecution based on the Convention grounds of race as White South Africans and membership in a particular social group as White South Africans perceived wealthy. They opined that the RPD also erred by applying an incorrect test by requiring evidence that extreme violence is disproportionately felt solely by White South Africans. They also submit that the RPD erred in reaching its conclusions by ignoring relevant evidence which supported the Appellants' narrative, while rejecting the claim because not all crimes experienced by White South Africans are racially motivated. In any event, they plead that they still benefited from the Maldonado truthfulness presumption and were not required to produce corroborative evidence. They argue that the RPD reached inconsistent findings by first holding that they will likely experience similar attacks when they returned to South Africa, but falling short from qualifying those recurrences as a serious possibility of persecution. They also opine that the RPD member erred by attaching too much weight to the lack of evidence of racially motivated crimes towards White South Africans in annual international reports contained in the NDP. They further submit that the tribunal erred by discarding documents on the basis that they were crowdsourced, while not clearly identifying the documents to which the tribunal attached low weight. Finally, they contend that the tribunal erred in its reading of the surveys, by failing to understand the connection between the feared crimes and the racial animus against South Africans Whites by Black South Africans, pointing at the public hate rhetoric of Black politicians against the Whites.\nNexus to the Convention\n[112] It is unclear what the RPD member considered to be the nexus to the Convention, but the member stated that he was \"willing to provisionally accept\" that the Appellants are members of a particular social group (PSG) formed by individuals targeted for their perceived wealth as a result of the apartheid. The tribunal specified that PSG would have to be targeted for more than economic reasons, as this has been excluded by the jurisprudence.\n[113] In his Basis of Claim form (BOC), Mr. XXXXwrote that he was not asking for refugee status as a member for the social group \"Whites in South Africa\". Instead, he claims that he is basing his refugee claim on \"race\", because he is White. Unfortunately, I am not sure I understand the difference. In their appeal submissions, the Appellants argue that they are members of a PSG defined as \"White South Africans perceived as wealthy\". He affirms that the international human rights reports do not reflect the reality in South Africa, as, contrary to what it is reported, \"violence of Blacks against Whites\" is a frequent occurrence among his circles. They also put forward that a refugee claim cannot fail only because they did not adduce extrinsic evidence to corroborate it.\n[114] I note that in the Yusuff case, the Federal Court reiterated that \"this Court has consistently held that perceived wealth, without more, does not constitute a particular social group\". 111 In the case of South Africa, the nexus is mixed, as race and perception of wealth can intertwine.\n[115] However, and it will be further analysed, objective evidence contained in the NDP states that White South Africans do not face particular challenges when it comes to employment, education and housing, a statement that is not contested by the Appellants.112 It also indicates that the White South Africans still hold a \"privileged position\" within the society, explaining that \"the net wealth of Black South Africans is only about five per cent of the average net wealth of White South Africans. White South Africans in South Africa live in the \"First World\"; their social and economic standard of living is similar to that in Eastern Europe or Israel.\"113 This, in my view, supports the finding of the RPD to the effect that the White South Africans are mostly targeted as a result of the high crime rate plaguing the country and because of their actual, as opposed to perceived, wealth.114 As wealth is not recognized as a valid ground of persecution, I will analyse whether there would be a serious possibility that the Appellants be subjected to persecution based on their race, if they were to return to their birth country. I will also analyse the risk under section 97 of IRPA.\nThe RPD Correctly Assessed the Appellants' Evidence\n[116] The Appellants testified that they were themselves victims of racially motivated crimes: (1) in XXXX 2011, when XXXX was almost snatched from Mrs. XXXXarms while at the bank machine; (2) in XXXX 2017, the adult Appellants were afraid that their daughter would be taken from the hospital; (3) six incidents in 2016 when Mrs. XXXXand her children were almost run over by Black taxi drivers. They also alleged that several White children were 'mowed over' by Black taxi drivers in recent years. They report the case of a friend's mother, XXXX XXXX, who was brutally tortured and murdered by her garden domestic helper. In XXXX 2017, the Appellant's aunt was attacked trying to prevent her own daughters from being raped by four Black men. The Appellants also talk about the six incidents during which their house was broken into by Black people. Finally, he recalls an incident when his car was almost stolen.\n[117] I agree with the RPD that, even if some of the violence seems to be racially motivated, the bulk of them were rather perpetrated for economic purposes, such as the breaking in the house. Even the attempt to snatch the boy from Mrs. XXXX can probably be seen as targeting to obtain a possible ransom, as she was taking money out of the bank machine at the relevant time.\n[118] As alleged by the Appellants, the racial tensions run high in South Africa. Corroborated by the objective evidence, utterances from some politicians display unacceptable racial hatred against the White minority.115 I also note the Facebook posts submitted by the Appellants in support of their allegations that they fear persecution based on their skin colour if they were to go back to South Africa.\n[119] I agree with the RPD that the episodes of racially motivated violence, such as the attempted run overs the Appellants experienced or those reported in the objective evidence they submitted, do not amount, in and of itself, to a serious possibility of persecution. As pointed out by the tribunal, though those incidents can be distressful, they do not support a systemic criminality based on racial discrimination against White South Africans.\n[120] I reject the Appellants' contentions to the effect that the RPD erred in ignoring evidence or selecting evidence that did not support their narrative. I note that the Appellants failed to identify which documents were in fact ignored and the impact it would have had on the conclusion.\n[121] As it will be later analysed, other pieces of evidence that demonstrate violence based on racial hatred are not sufficient to rise to the level of serious possibility of persecution.\nThe RPD Correctly Found the Lack of Objective Basis of the Fear of Persecution\n[122] The RPD accepted that the Appellants genuinely fear returning to South Africa, a finding that is correct according to my reading of the evidence. However, I agree with the RPD that the targeting of White South Africans is predominantly based on economic reasons as they are, in fact, wealthier, as noted above.\n[123] The RPD noted that documents contained in exhibits C-16, C-13, C-17 and C-23 report clearly racially motivated crimes, as well as video 5. I agree with this assessment.\n[124] I also note the affidavit of Mr. XXXX, XXXX of XXXX XXXX, dated March 2, 2012, in which he opined that English-speaking White South Africans are the subject of hate crimes, and when racial epithets are uttered during the commission of a crime, such crime can be deemed to be motivated by hate. As for violent crimes against White South Africans that remain unreported, it mostly concerns farm murders as indicated in the affidavit by XXXX XXXX, dated June 2, 2012. As pointed out by the RPD, the Appellants are not part of that group. In another affidavit dated October 10, 2014, the same affiant complains that main NGOs do not report hate crimes perpetrated against White individuals, but no explanation is provided. Also, I note that Mrs. XXXX explains in this affidavit that the upper-class and middle-class homes can afford to strengthen their security systems to repel possible aggressors, a commodity that the poorer Black communities can probably not afford, which explains why they are more likely to fall victim to violent crimes.\n[125] I also find that the Appellant's documents show that, at times, the justice system properly intervened to investigate and prosecute the suspects of those racially motivated violent crimes. At page 97 of the Appellants' disclosure material, the author stated: \"The country's high crime statistics (nearly 19,000 murders a year) have undermined cohesion and investment. Following the erosion of their privilege, Afrikaners feel particularly vulnerable, both as Whites and as linguistic minority.\" I believe that this accurately describes the situation of the Appellants as feeling vulnerable in the face of high crime rates, which does not necessarily follow that they would face a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to South Africa.\n[126] The Appellants also submitted the former Response to Information Request (RIR) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) dated 28 May 2013, under Exhibit 16, p. 100 stating that: \" ... based on the 2011-2012 XXXX annual report, White and Asian South Africans are less likely than African or Coloured South Africans to be murdered, and stresses that socio-economic status, rather than racial classification, determines the likelihood of being a victim of a violent crime.\" In effect, this supports the RPD conclusion that, while White South Africans are victims of violent crimes that are sometimes also hate crimes, the overall statistics show that Black South Africans remain the primary victims of those crimes that are a result of socio-economic status, as opposed to based on racial hatred.\n[127] I note the additional information provided by the Appellants that include two new incidents that occurred to individuals in their circles. The first incident described in an email dated October 24, 2019, involves a robbery of a family house during which no one was gravely harmed, though an elderly victim succumbed from PTSD. This indicates that the motives were most probably economical, as opposed to based on racial hatred.\n[128] The Wikipedia page that was attributed no weight by the RPD concerns the movement Black First Land First (BLF) which pleads for the policy 'expropriation without compensation' aiming at taking the lands from White-owned land. This mainly relates to White farmers, a group to which the Appellants do not belong. Also, I am cognizant of the racial tensions in South Africa as a consequence of the apartheid and hate speech that take place against the White minority as a result. However, South Africa is also plagued by a very high crime rate that affect the population as a whole. Though the White population is more likely to face a certain kind of crime due to their actual or perceived wealth, they are less likely to face others, as it will be more extensively discussed below.116\nObjective Documents of the NDP Do Not Support the Appellants' Allegations\n[129] I reject the Appellants' contention that the RPD erred in attaching weight to the absence of information in the annual international reports contained in the NDP. As pointed out by the member, it is reasonable to expect that either the US Department of State's human rights report, the Amnesty International's State of the World Human Rights report, the Human Rights World Watch Report, or the Freedom House's Freedom in the World report would have reported if the White South Africans were persecuted on the basis of their race, if that were the case. I note that, in the newest NDP, the US Congressional Research Service report that White farmers are \"periodically victimised in criminal attacks\".117 Those attacks were labelled as opportunistic and, sometimes, also racially motivated. It specifies that the xenophobic mob violence target mainly foreigners, while many Whites often live in gated, highly secured communities.118\n[130] I note that in document C-10, that Trade union Solidarity submitted a complaint to the United Nations (UN) Committee on the elimination of Racial Discrimination regarding hate speech targeting minorities. Yet, I observe that the Appellants have failed to submit any report from the competent UN or African international mechanisms that could reveal the extent of the violence waged by Black individuals against White South Africans. I therefore reject the Appellants' contention that the RPD erred by attributing too much weight to the absence of information in the NDP. Indeed, the burden lays on them to show that reliable reports, whether governmental or not, provide the information to support their allegations. The evidence of single incidents, though relevant, is insufficient. I believe that going on a case-by-case basis can be misleading and is preferable to rely on reports that show the bigger picture concerning the situation of White South Africans within the population as a whole.\n[131] I also reject the Appellants' contention that the RPD erred in omitting to understand the connection between the feared crimes and the anti-White rhetoric. I reviewed the analysis elaborated at pages 14 to 18 of the oral decision, and I find that the RPD was correct in its observations. The Appellants failed to point at any error in that regard.\n[132] Indeed, I agree in particular with the conclusion that, even if White-headed households seem to fall disproportionally victims to burglary and car theft, it finds a reasonable explanation by the fact that the White minority still owns a majority of the wealth in South Africa, including business opportunities and landownership. The NDP reveals that South Africa still arbours the highest rates of inequality of the world and the richest 10% still hold around 71% of the country's wealth.119 The disparity must also take into account that \"crimes experienced by poor and vulnerable individuals are far less likely to be reported or recorded by the police.\"120 In any event, it is to be expected that wealthier individuals will be more likely to be targeted by economic crimes, such as robbery and car hijacking, which, in South Africa, translates into White minorities.\n[133] I note that the RPD conducted a cross analysis between the statistics regarding the crimes and the possible racial motivation behind them. It correctly considered that, had those crimes been perpetrated based on racial hatred, it would have been expected that a much higher proportion of cars belonging to White individuals to be targeted, which is not the case. The Appellants did not show how this analysis was flawed, especially when 91% of White individuals own a car, as opposed to 20% for their Black counterparts. Consequently, I believe that the RPD correctly concluded that the slightly disproportionate number of economic crimes to which the White South Africans fall victim is explained by their advantageous economic situation.\n[134] Regarding violent crimes, I note that South Africa ranks fifth in the world as the number rate per capita. The reasons for such a high rate were attributed to diverse causes including socio-economic inequality and marginalization and social bias. However, violent crimes, including assault, sexual assault and murder, combined correspond to 5.5% of the totality of the criminal offences registered.121 As pointed out by the RPD, out of the 16,000 murders reported, only 182 concerned White South African victims. Those numbers reveal that the White South African group is therefore less at risk of a violent crime than their Black countrymen. Though hatred-fuelled violent crimes do take place against the White population, the overall statistics do not support the allegation that the risk faced concerns more than a mere possibility.\n[135] The survey also shows that White South Africans enjoyed a better relationship with the police, contrary to the Appellants' experience, especially in comparison with the Black population. As pointed out by the RPD, this does not support the Appellants' allegation that the police force is discriminating against the White population. Again, the Appellants did not explain how this analysis is erred.\n[136] As it was pointed out by the RPD, the Appellants failed to address the conclusion of the Race Relations report in South Africa stating that \"race relations in South Africa held up surprisingly well during 2018\", despite the strong racial rhetoric from the political parties, especially noting Mr. Malena's hate speeches.122 I find that the analysis of the RPD regarding this issue is correct and that the Appellants failed to identify any errors.\n[137] I therefore agree that, overall, the objective evidence of the NDP shows that South Africa experiences a very high crime rate affecting the population as a whole. While the White population is more targeted when it comes to economic crimes based on their actual greater wealth, the surveys show that the Black population is more likely to be victims of violent crimes, especially as a result of gang violence.123\n[138] Consequently, I rule that the RPD correctly found that there was a lack of evidence to support the allegation that the White South Africans perceived as wealthy are disproportionally targeted because of their race, rather than because they are actually wealthier and thus represent better targets for economical crimes. The Appellants failed to establish a nexus to the Convention, as perceived or actual wealth is not recognized as a basis for persecution.124\nThe RPD Correctly Found Insufficient Evidence of Gender-Based Persecution\n[139] The RPD judged that the female Appellants have failed to lead evidence showing an increased risk of gender violence, beyond the one faced by the population as a whole.\n[140] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred by requiring that they provide evidence that would put the female Appellants specifically and personally at an increased risk in comparison to the rest of the population. They further argue that the RPD failed to take into account the Chairperson Guidelines 4 regarding refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution. They underline the passage of the Guidelines referring to the Salibian case stating that it was unnecessary for them to put forward a basis of an individualized set of facts. They opine that the RPD ignored the ample country condition evidence of the NDP, indicating that women face severe discrimination and are at risk of sexual violence and failed to refer to evidence in support of its conclusion.\n[141] I agree with the Appellants that the RPD omitted to refer to the Gender Guidelines in the context of its analysis on allegations of gender-based persecution. I will ensure that the RPD analysis respects such guidelines in the framework of my own analysis and I will also consider them as part of my independent review of the evidence.\n[142] The objective evidence reveals that South African women face discrimination in all areas of life:\nAlthough all South Africans are nominally equal under the law, discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ability, nationality and sexual orientation is still widespread. South Africa remains a socially conservative and patriarchal state and this manifests in exceptionally high levels of gender-based violence and rape.125\n[143] As pointed out by the Appellants, documents contained in the NDP, either the one of July 30, 2021, or the newest one, establishes that gender-based violence (GBV) and feminicide are a problem in South Africa, 51% of surveyed women in the Gauteng province and 44% of the Western Cape were victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives. Domestic violence is very prevalent and constitutes the cause of 54% of feminicide.126 The Appellants are from Johannesburg, a city located in the Gauteng province.\n[144] Other documents of the NDP put forward the following relevant information:\nAlthough the law criminalizes domestic violence and rape of men or women, the number of reported raped cases rose from 41,583 in 2018-2019 to 42,289 in 2019-2020. South Africa has some of the world's highest rates of gender-based-violence and femicide. Most perpetrators were acquaintances or family members of victims. Although laws prohibit sexual harassment, it remains a widespread problem for women.127 [emphasis added]\n[145] The violence against women is said to be a pervasive issue in South Africa. It triggered State action through the creation of independent institutions to safeguard civil rights and a governmental action plan to combat GBV in 2019.128 I note that the evidence does not segregate White from Black victims.\n[146] Mrs. XXXXdoes not allege having been the victim of or fearing violence from her partner. There is no allegation that the female Appellants fear acquaintances or family members either. I understand that none of them have been victims of GBV in the past from family members or others. I note that violent crimes account for only 5.5% of all crimes in South Africa. According to the Appellants' evidence, a person aged above 16 years old faced a 0.25% chance in 2018-2019 of being the victim of sexual violence.129 Though the GBV is a scourge in South Africa, the Appellants do not possess the profile of females that would face a serious possibility of persecution based on their gender, as demonstrated by the objective evidence. Nothing in the Chairperson's Guidelines would indicate otherwise.\n[147] Even when considering the intersectionality between gender and race in the context of a fear based on perceived wealth, I am unable to find evidence that would put the female Appellants in a position of facing a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to South Africa. There is no evidence that the White South African females are being targeted by gender-based violence through the lens of perceived wealth, but rather in the context of personal, domestic relationships.\n[148] Consequently, I believe that the RPD was correct when it ruled that the Appellants failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of their allegation that they would face a serious possibility of gender-based persecution if they were to return to South Africa.\n[149] Based on the facts alleged, the Appellants also failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that they would face a personalised risk, as define by section 97 of IRPA, beyond general criminality. Indeed, as illustrated above, the crime rate in South Africa is particularly high, but section 97 (1) b) (ii) of IRPA excludes a risk that is faced generally by other individuals in a country, such as general criminality.\nCONCLUSION\n[150] I dismiss the appeal. I find that the Associate Appellant is not excluded from the refugee protection regime, pursuant to section 98 of IRPA, however, I conclude that the RPD correctly found that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of IRPA.\n(signed)\nMe Martine Durocher\nMe Martine Durocher\nFebruary 2, 2023\nDate\n1 Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration v.

In her BOC Form, your spouse states that she is a citizen of Rwanda. In their BOC Forms, your two sons state that they are citizens of Burundi.1 That said, during the hearing, you all stated that you are citizens of both countries.2\n[3] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the Minister) intervened in your claims for refugee protection and submitted that your identity had not been established.3\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) identified your identity as the determinative issue and concluded that you had not established your identity.4\n[5] In your appeal, you state that you are submitting new evidence and you are requesting an oral hearing if the panel is of the view that the new evidence is not credible.5 You have submitted that your counsel before the RPD acted negligently by not adequately representing you and that the RPD erred with respect to your identity.6\n[6] Based on my analysis of your record, the evidence presented with your appeal is inadmissible (I) and there is no cause to hold a hearing (II). Moreover, the RPD did not err as you allege (III). Your appeal is dismissed.\nI. THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN YOUR APPEAL\n[7] The Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules) state that your appeal record must include:\n* a written statement indicating whether you are relying on any evidence referred to in subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA);\n* any documentary evidence that you want to rely on in your appeal; and\n* a memorandum that includes full and detailed submissions regarding how any documentary evidence on which you want to rely meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) and how that evidence relates to you.7\nA. The evidence filed with your appeal and your submissions regarding the evidence\n[8] You included five documents in your appeal record:\nA-1: The driver's licence issued by Burundi to XXXX XXXX8\nA-2: The driver's licence issued by Rwanda to XXXX XXXX XXXX9\nA-3: The birth certificate of XXXX XXXX XXXX10\nA-4: The old passport of XXXX XXXX XXXX11\nA-5: The certificate of nationality of XXXX XXXX12\n[9] You state in your affidavit13 that during the hearing:\n* you explained that you were scared when you arrived and therefore did not provide all the information in a coherent manner;14\n* you only indicated your nationality of birth and omitted the fact that you had a national identity card from Rwanda, as you were a Rwandan national because your wife is Rwandan;15\n* you indicated, however, that your passport is genuine and even that you skipped a step in obtaining your Rwandan nationality, knowing that you had not taken all the required steps, such as taking the oath and publishing your name in Rwanda's official journal;16\n* your wife indicated her nationality of birth and your sons indicated their nationalities of birth, that they were born to a Burundian father;17\n* as the head of the XXXX district, you indicated that it would be easier for the children to state that they were born in Rwanda to make it easier to obtain the identity card and passport later, and thus, at the border, you stated that your children's passports contained incorrect information about their place of birth;18\n* you already had Rwandan identity cards at that time, but you could not provide them because they were in Rwanda, as you only had some of your identity documents in XXXX 2021, when your son XXXX sent you those documents;19\n* other identity documents (your wife's Rwandan driver's licence and your Burundian driver's licence) had not all been found at that time, as your son was unable to find them or give them to you;20\n* in XXXX 2022, your son gave all the documents he had been able to find in your affairs to a friend, XXXX XXXX XXXX;21\n* you testified twice confirming that you are Burundian, but that testimony is not mentioned in the assessment of your identity;22\n* your spouse's sister welcomed you when you arrived, but due to family problems, your ties became strained; but, through a friend, after the RPD hearing, your wife was able to speak with her sister, who could testify to prove your wife's identity;23\n* if you had known that your wife needed to provide testimony about her identity despite her genuine passport, you would have provided such testimony to corroborate her identity; unfortunately, your counsel did not give you adequate advice in that respect, and he said that the name appearing on her passport would be corrected following the hearing, which was not done.24\n[10] In your appeal record, I found an affidavit from XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022.25 In it, she states that she is a friend of your spouse, that she is aware of the family conflict between your spouse and her sister, and that your spouse was unable to speak with her sister until XXXX 2022.\n[11] In your memorandum, you submit that the driver's licences (A-1 and A-2) were received on XXXX XXXX, 2022, a day before the RPD rendered its decision, meaning that those documents were not reasonably available. Moreover, those documents could have changed the RPD decision, since the Rwandan driver's licence contains biometric data.26\n[12] You also submit that your spouse's birth certificate (A-3) and your certificate of nationality (A-5) were not submitted, even though they were available, because you could not reasonably have been expected to have presented them in the circumstances at the time of the rejection. In addition, these documents rebut the RPD's finding that your spouse did not establish her identity and attest to you being a Rwandan citizen, as Rwandan national identity cards contain 13 unchanging numbers.27\n[13] Finally, you submit that your spouse's birth certificate (A-3) is consistent with the way your spouse writes her name, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that Tab 3.5 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Rwanda explains that given names and family names are often interchanged, including from one passport to another.28\nB. Subsection 110(4) creates an exception to the general rule\n[14] Subsection 110(3) of the IRPA provides that, in general, the RAD must proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the record of the proceedings of the RPD. Subsection 110(4) creates an exception to this general rule. The existence of criteria governing the admissibility of evidence on appeal helps to preserve the integrity of the process by promoting finality with respect to the factual record at the first level of decision-making (with very limited exceptions) and encouraging the narrowing of issues as matters move up the appellate ladder.29\n[15] When analyzing the evidence presented on appeal, I must determine whether or not it is admissible, pursuant to subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and the case law that has interpreted this provision. For such evidence to be declared admissible, it must first fall within one of the three categories described in subsection 110(4): (i) it arose after the rejection of the refugee protection claim; (ii) it was not reasonably available; or (iii) the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it before the RPD. The admissibility criteria for this evidence also includes those developed in Raza.30\n[16] The circumstances of a specific case may allow the RAD to apply the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA with more or less flexibility.31 However, in Hassan, the Federal Court stated that the flexible approach referred to in Singh applies only to the admissibility of new evidence when the requirements in subsection 110(4) are met. The Court then noted that subsection 110(4) must be narrowly interpreted and that the role of the RAD is not to provide the opportunity to complete a deficient record before the RPD.32\nC. This evidence is not admissible\n[17] Based on my analysis, this evidence is not admissible for the following reasons.\n[18] The reasons you cite for allowing the evidence included in your appeal memorandum are unfounded. Indeed, these documents seek to remedy deficiencies in the evidence presented before the RPD, which is not the objective of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA,33 as it was your responsibility to put your best foot forward to the RPD.34\n[19] These documents are not related to facts that occurred after your refugee protection claims were rejected. The fact that a document was created after your refugee protection claim was rejected does not mean that the facts to which it refers are new or that they occurred after the rejection. In this respect, I find it useful to reiterate what the Federal Court clearly stated in Davoodabadi:\n19. The admissibility of new evidence on an appeal to the RAD is governed by subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. ...\n20. The RAD must apply this test when determining whether or not to admit new evidence presented by the person who is the subject of the appeal (Singh at paras 34-35). It has no discretion to disregard these criteria (Singh at para 63). The only time they do not apply is when the person who is the subject of the appeal presents evidence in response to evidence presented by the Minister (see IRPA, subsection 110(5)). The factors discussed in Raza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 385 at paras 13-14 [Raza] (credibility, relevance, newness, and materiality) are also applicable, although they must be adapted to the context of a RAD appeal (Singh at paras 44-49). ...\n32. Similarly, the respondent submitted to the RAD that the letters he had filed were admissible because they all arose after the RPD's decision. While they were all apparently written after the RPD's decision, this is not the test (Raza at para 16; Galamb v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1230 at paras 15-21). The relevant question is whether their contents relate to events occurring after the hearing or not.35\nYour driver's licence (A-1)\n[20] Your Burundian driver's licence (A-1) was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and was valid until XXXX XXXX, 2019. This driver's licence is clearly not related to events that occurred after the RPD's rejection of your refugee protection claims on XXXX XXXX, 2022.\n[21] In your memorandum, you submit that the driver's licence was received on XXXX XXXX, 2022, one day before the RPD rendered its decision, meaning that the document was not reasonably available before the RPD rejected your refugee protection claims. In your appeal memorandum, you included an affidavit dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, from one of your friends, who stated that he went to Rwanda from XXXX XXXX, to XXXX XXXX, 2022, and that he brought you a package containing, among other things, your Burundian driver's licence.36\n[22] Even if I accept that the driver's licence was not reasonably available before the RPD rejected your refugee protection claims, I see no information in the driver's licence that could establish that you are indeed a citizen of Burundi. It can be inferred that such a driver's licence can also be obtained by a resident living in Burundi, not just a citizen. Certainly, you did not include documentary evidence in your memorandum indicating that, in Burundi, driver's licences are primary identity documents that can independently establish that the holder is a citizen of Burundi. In other words, to reiterate one of the criteria set out in Raza, I do not consider this driver's licence to be relevant, that is, it is unable to prove or disprove a fact relevant to your refugee protection claim,37 in your case the fact that you are indeed a citizen of Burundi.\nYour spouse's driver's licence (A-2)\n[23] Your spouse's Rwandan driver's licence (A-2) was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2007, and is still valid. That being agreed, it is not related to events that occurred after the RPD's rejection of your refugee protection claims on March 8, 2022.\n[24] In your memorandum, you submit that the driver's licence was received on XXXX XXXX, 2022, a day before the RPD decision was issued, meaning that the document was not reasonably available before the RPD rejected your refugee protection claims. In your appeal memorandum, you include an affidavit dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022, from one of your friends, who states in it that he went to Rwanda from XXXX XXXX, to XXXX XXXX, 2022, and brought you back a package containing, among other things, your spouse's Rwandan driver's licence.38\n[25] Even if I accept that the driver's licence was not reasonably available before the RPD rejected your refugee protection claims, I see no information in the driver's licence that could establish that your spouse is indeed a citizen of Rwanda. It can be inferred that such a driver's licence can also be obtained by a resident living in Burundi, not just a citizen. Certainly, you did not include documentary evidence in your memorandum indicating that, in Rwanda, driver's licences are primary identity documents that can independently establish that the holder is a citizen of Rwanda. In other words, to reiterate one of the criteria set out in Raza, I do not consider this driver's licence to be relevant, that is, it is unable to prove or disprove a fact relevant to your refugee protection claim,39 in your case the fact that your spouse is in fact a citizen of Rwanda.\nYour spouse's birth certificate (A-3)\n[26] Your spouse's birth certificate (A-3) was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2022. It indicates that her name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, that she was born on XXXX XXXX, 1969, and that she was the declarant. It lists two witnesses, but their signatures cannot be seen, although the document indicates that they signed. It also lists the civil registrar, but his signature cannot be seen, although the document indicates that he signed, and his stamp cannot be seen either. There is no information in the document to establish what documents were presented at the Civil Status Office for the registrar to be able to issue the birth certificate.\n[27] The documentary evidence explains the requirements and steps to be taken to obtain a copy of a birth certificate. It also describes the appearance of a birth certificate and the information it contains and provides concrete examples.40 Based on my analysis of that birth certificate, it is not consistent with the examples given in the documentary evidence. I therefore find that the document is not credible or trustworthy and that there is no cause for it to be considered.41\n[28] It is also clear that the document is not related to a fact that occurred after your refugee protection claims were rejected. In your memorandum, you explain that although the birth certificate was reasonably available before the rejection, you could not reasonably have been expected to have presented it in the circumstances because your counsel at the time did not provide you with adequate advice about this. In my view, your statement is not acceptable, as a birth certificate is a fundamental identity document in Rwanda and all births must be reported within 30 days of giving birth.42 Not to mention that your BOC Form clearly indicates that you are required to obtain and submit any documents to the IRB in support of your refugee protection claim, including identity documents, and that you are required to submit two copies of them without delay.43 In signing her BOC Form on XXXX XXXX, 2018, your spouse declared that she could read French and that she fully understood the contents of the form.44 In other words, even accepting that your former counsel did not inform you of your obligation to provide documents to prove your spouse's identity, I am of the opinion that simply reading your BOC Form would have shown that you had such an obligation to obtain all identity documents, including birth certificates, and to submit them without delay.\nYour spouse's old passport (A-4)\n[29] In your memorandum, I do not see any full and detailed submissions regarding how your spouse's old passport (A-4) meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) and how it relates to her. This document is clearly not related to events that occurred after the RPD's rejection of your refugee protection claims.\n[30] You also did not include any submissions in your memorandum regarding the old passport issued in XXXX 2021 not being reasonably available or, if it was, why you did not submit it as evidence before the RPD. Regardless, before the RPD, the Minister filed in evidence a more recent passport for your spouse.45\nYour certificate of nationality (A-5)\n[31] Your certificate of nationality (A-5) was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2022, in XXXX, Gasabo, by XXXX XXXX, the executive secretary for the XXXX sector. It indicates that your name is XXXX XXXX and that you are a Rwandan national. There is no information in this document to establish what documents were presented at the Civil Registrar's Office for the secretary general to issue this certificate of nationality.\n[32] Given the source and the circumstances in which it appeared, I find that the certificate is not credible or trustworthy and therefore that there is no cause for it to be considered.46\n[33] It is also clear that this certificate of nationality is not related to a fact that occurred after your refugee protection claims were rejected. In your memorandum, you explain that although the certificate of nationality was reasonably available before the rejection, you could not reasonably have been expected to have presented it in the circumstances, but you do not explain why. In my view, your statement is not acceptable, given that, during the hearing before the RPD, you submitted in evidence a national identity card from Rwanda that appears to me to be equivalent to such a certificate of nationality.\nII. HOLDING AN ORAL HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[34] The RAD Rules state that you must include in your memorandum full submissions regarding why you believe the RAD should hold an oral hearing.47\n[35] In your statement, you request that an oral hearing be held if the panel is of the view that the new evidence is not credible.48 In your memorandum, you request that a hearing be held if the panel questions the credibility of the evidence so that you can respond orally to any questions from the member.49\n[36] The onus rests with the RAD to determine whether or not the criteria set out in subsection 110(6) have been met.50 I am of the opinion that the evidence presented with your appeal is not admissible. An oral hearing therefore cannot be held under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.51\n[37] Even if I had concluded that one of the documents you presented with your appeal were admissible, I would have no obligation to hold an oral hearing simply because new evidence was deemed admissible, as the RAD has discretion in this respect and must ensure that the three criteria set out in subsection 110(6) are fulfilled.52 The RAD must exercise its discretion as to whether to hold an oral hearing reasonably.53\n[38] Subsection 110(6) of the IRPA states that the RAD can hold an oral hearing only if it finds that new documentary evidence is admissible that (a) raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of appellants; (b) is central to the decision with respect to their refugee protection claims; and (c) if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim, as applicable. Based on my analysis of the documents you presented with your appeal, they are not central to the decision with respect to your refugee protection claims and cannot justify allowing or refusing your claims. Thus, all the criteria set out in subsection 110(6) of the IRPA have not been met, and even if I had concluded that one of the documents presented in your appeal record were admissible, there would be no cause to hold an oral hearing in your appeal.\nIII. ANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\n[39] The role of the RAD is to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged,54 without necessarily limiting itself solely to the arguments presented in the appeal memorandum.55 The RAD is entitled to substitute its own opinion for that of the RPD when the RPD has erred.56 Except in the limited circumstances described in subsection 111(2) of the IRPA, the RAD makes the final call, subject to judicial review, in order to promote the finality of the claims process.57\n[40] I have reviewed your record,58 which included reading the transcript of the hearing before the RPD59 and the documentary evidence. I have also applied the principle of responsive justification by ensuring that my decision is justified in light of the facts and law and considers the potential consequences for your life, liberty and dignity.60 With respect to the RPD decision, I am of the opinion that the standard of correctness should be applied.61\nA. The errors you allege the Refugee Protection Division made\n[41] The RAD Rules require that you specify: (i) the errors that are the grounds of the appeal, and (ii) where the errors are located in the RPD decision or in the transcript of any recording of the hearing.62\n[42] You did not include in your appeal record the full or partial transcript of the RPD hearing. The RAD Rules require you to do so if you want to rely on it in your appeal.63 In any case, the transcript of the hearing before the RPD is part of your record and I, of course, read it.\n[43] In your memorandum, you identify four issues:64\n* Did the member err in failing to consider the evidence presented concerning the principal appellant's identity?\n* Did the member err in conducting a microscopic analysis of the evidence presented to prove the appellants' identities?\n* Was the appellants' counsel before the RPD negligent by not providing adequate representation to the appellants?\n* Did the member err by focusing on the appellants' statements when they arrived in Canada?\n[44] With respect to the first question, you submit that the member erred by failing to consider the evidence before him, particularly the two testimonies provided by members of the Alliance des Burundais du Canada [Burundian alliance of Canada] that are not mentioned in his decision.65 You state that it is essential that the RPD refer to evidence that calls its conclusion into question. However, at paragraph 154, the member states that no testimony was provided, which is not the case and confirms that he did not assess the testimonies provided to prove your identity.66\n[45] With respect to the second question, you submit that the member erred in capriciously dismissing the evidence presented to establish your identity.67\n[46] You cite as an example the Burundian special travel document issued to you that the member, at paragraph 81 of his decision, considered to be unreliable because it does not contain any biometric data, even though the document contains your date of birth. You also refer to the documentary evidence indicating that this type of document is the equivalent of a pass and that the member erred in questioning the document's reliability.68\n[47] You also cite the example of your Rwandan national identity cards, which the member dismissed based on a signature that was supposedly not exactly the one on your BOC Form, when he should have considered the fact that those signatures were created on a touch screen, which can change your signature each time, not to mention that a person's signature can change over time.69\n[48] You cite another example regarding your Rwandan passport. The member incorrectly concluded that your passport was false, even though on your arrival in Canada you declared that your Rwandan passports were genuine but that you had skipped a step in obtaining Rwandan nationality.70\n[49] As for the third question, you submit that your former counsel failed to inform you of the need to provide documents or testimony to corroborate your spouse's identity, which explains why no documents or testimony were provided to prove her identity, even though you and your two sons provided several documents to prove your identity. The failure to inform you of this had an impact on the member's decision, since the decision is based on the evidence submitted.71\n[50] As for the fourth question, you submit that the member's decision placed considerable emphasis on the statements you made at the border, when the Federal Court has repeatedly cautioned against placing too much emphasis on such statements.72\n[51] In the conclusion of your memorandum, you ask that the RPD's determination be set aside and replaced by a positive RAD determination granting you refugee status.73\nB. The Refugee Protection Division's decision\n[52] In its decision, the RPD indicates that the parties agreed at the start of the hearing that it would first decide on your identity and that the hearing would then continue, if necessary.74 It refers to the Minister's intervention75 and lists the documents you presented to the Canadian authorities to establish your identity.76 It identifies your identity as the determinative issue77 and, after hearing your testimony and analyzing the evidence on the record, it concludes that you did not discharge your burden of establishing your identity.78\n[53] I consider it useful here to reproduce the main paragraphs explaining its conclusion:\n[Translation]\n15. The claimants did not provide any identity documents with sufficiently reliable probative value to establish their identity, and more specifically, their nationality.\n16. All of the claimants' passports present a reliability issue, either due to how they were obtained or due to the information they contain that contradicts the claimants' statements.\n17. According to the claimants' statements, the female claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Rwanda by birth. Consequently, the information in the National Documentation Package on Rwanda suggests that her two children, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, are legally entitled to obtain Rwandan nationality by filiation. Despite this, the claimants instead decided to obtain Rwandan passports for their two children through fraud, using a false declaration about their place of birth. That behaviour raises questions about the motivation and actual identity of the three claimants.\n18. Several of the claimants' national identity cards present reliability issues. XXXX XXXX's card contains a typographical error, XXXX XXXX XXXX's card does not contain her own fingerprint and XXXX XXXX's card contains an error in his date of birth. Moreover, all the national identity documents on the record are from a friend of the family named XXXX instead of directly from formal administrative authorities in Burundi. According to the National Documentation Package on Burundi, corruption and document fraud are major problems in Burundi. This raises doubts about the reliability and authenticity of these documents.\n19. The birth certificates of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX contain contradictory statements about the actual nationality of their mother, Ms. XXXX.\n20. Based on an assessment of the record with particular consideration of the above, the Minister is of the view that the claimants failed to provide identity documents that are sufficiently compelling, on a balance of probabilities.\n21. The history of fraud and the reliability issues cast significant doubt on the credibility, identity and actual nationality of the claimants.79\nC. The Refugee Protection Division did not err as you allege\n[54] Based on my own analysis of your record, the RPD did not err as you allege, for the following reasons.\nThe legal principles guiding the analysis of a claimant's identity\n[55] The question of whether a refugee protection claimant has established their identity is a question of fact and credibility.80 Claimants bear the onus of establishing on a balance of probabilities that they are who they claim to be, as identity is a key element of any refugee protection claim.81 Claimants must provide acceptable documents establishing their identity, failing which they must explain why they do not have such documentation and what steps they took to obtain the documentation.82\n[56] It is the task of the trier of fact to weigh the testimonial and documentary evidence and to draw conclusions as to whether the evidence is sufficient to establish the claimant's identity on a balance of probabilities.83 The trier of fact can decide that documents are fraudulent and give them little or no probative value. It can also be decided that the explanations provided about irregularities in a document simply do not add up. Nonetheless, the finding that identity documents found to be false can have an effect on a claimant's overall credibility must be cautiously approached.84 While it would be unreasonable to conclude that, because a claimant has submitted a fraudulent document, all of the claimant's documents are fraudulent, the trier of fact may analyze the documents used to persuade a country's authorities to issue a passport to the claimant, the reliability of which would be based on the reliability of the documents used to obtain it.85\n[57] It is also well-established that determination of identity is at the core of the RPD's expertise.86 The RPD is not required to conduct a forensic assessment of identity documents presented to it as long as there is sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the authenticity of the document or how an authentic document may have been obtained.87\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not fail to consider all the evidence\n[58] In your memorandum, you submit that the RPD erred in considering the evidence before it, particularly the two testimonies provided by members of the Alliance des Burundais du Canada that are not mentioned in the decision.\n[59] As you state in your memorandum, the RPD wrote at paragraph 154 of its decision that it was of the view that you did not provide credible or probative testimony or documents to establish your identities and, as a result, did not discharge your burden of establishing your identity.88\n[60] In my view, that paragraph must be read in light of the RPD decision as a whole. At paragraph 25 of its decision, the RPD or the panel clearly wrote that it had considered all the evidence, including your testimonies and the documents you presented in evidence, namely exhibits D-1 to D-12.89 The written testimonies from the members of the Alliance Burundais du Canada are therefore mentioned in the RPD decision, and your argument that it failed to consider them is therefore unfounded.\n[61] For my part, I have carefully read document D-1. It was signed on XXXX XXXX, 2020, by the president of the association, who also states that two witnesses attested that you are a Burundian national. To reach that conclusion, the two stated that they have known you for several years and have seen you carrying out activities in Burundi. The president states that the document was issued to inform immigration authorities of your nationality.90\n[62] In your memorandum, referring to a Federal Court decision, you submit that it is essential that the panel refer to evidence that challenges its conclusion and that its decision must be set aside because it ignored two important testimonies regarding your nationality and the work you carried out in Burundi.\n[63] With respect, I consider your arguments to be unfounded. Indeed, while it is true that there is a need to refer to evidence that, at first glance, contradicts the RPD's conclusions,91 after reading the written testimonies in the document from the Alliance des Burundais du Canada, I am of the opinion that it is too far a stretch to say that these testimonies contradict the RPD's conclusions. This is simply because the two witnesses in question simply relied on their personal knowledge, without doing any research whatsoever that would enable them to conclude, based on official identity documents, that you are in fact a Burundian citizen.\n[64] In truth, it is quite possible that these witnesses personally believe that you are a Burundian citizen, but their statements in that respect cannot, in my view, constitute a sufficiently trustworthy or reliable basis to support a conclusion92 that you are in fact a citizen of that country. In that respect, it should be noted that the lack of reliability of evidence may lead a decision-maker to give the evidence minimal or no weight.93 The assertions by the two witnesses cited in document D-1, although they were made in good faith, do not have a high level of reliability, and in my view, it is permissible to not give them any probative value.\n[65] In conclusion on this point, I am of the view that it would certainly have been better for the RPD to directly discuss these two testimonies, but it did so, however indirectly, by writing that you had not provided any credible and probative documents to establish your identity.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not capriciously dismiss the evidence of your identity\n[66] In your memorandum, you submit that the RPD erred by capriciously dismissing the evidence presented to establish your identity. Whether it was your Rwandan national identity cards, your Rwandan passport or the Burundian special travel document, based on my own analysis of your record, the RPD methodically analyzed each document while considering the Minister's intervention, your testimonies and the documentary evidence. Your argument that the RPD capriciously dismissed your identity documents or microscopically analyzed them is unfounded.\n[67] It should be noted that section 106 of the IRPA and rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules94 place the onus on individuals claiming refugee protection to provide acceptable documents establishing their identity, on a balance of probabilities. 95\n[68] Major issues were identified concerning several of your identity documents in the Minister's intervention.96 During the RPD hearing, you were confronted with these issues.\n[69] With respect to the fact that your Burundian national identity cards had fingerprints that were not yours, you and your spouse acknowledged that the prints were not yours.97 The Minister addressed this issue in his written submissions.98 Based on my own analysis of your record, the RPD did not err in finding these cards to be false, giving no weight to them and drawing a negative inference about your credibility.99\n[70] You and your spouse were also confronted with the fact that the signatures on your Rwandan identity cards did not match the signatures on your BOC Form. Your initial responses were that the two signatures were yours, that they could change depending on the circumstances.100 At the time, you did not mention a difference caused by your having signed the cards on a touch screen. I have compared the signatures in question, and I too find them to be different.101\n[71] However, the RPD's analysis was not limited to the single issue of the difference in your signatures. Referring to the NDP on Rwanda,102 the RPD pointed out to you that these cards are supposed to include fingerprints, which your cards do not. You replied that there were no fingerprints, that there were signatures.103 It is clear to me that you did not answer the question raised at that time by the RPD and that you therefore did not explain the absence of fingerprints on your Rwandan national identity cards. Based on my own analysis of your record, the RPD did not err in finding these cards to be false, giving no weight to them and drawing a negative inference about your credibility.104\n[72] In addition, during the hearing, the Minister's representative asked you if you had obtained a Rwandan passport and national identity card without providing the required documents when you obtained them. Your response was yes.105\n[73] The RPD confronted you with the fact that, at your interview when you arrived in Canada, you stated that the Rwandan passport was false. You then replied that it was a way of saying that you had acquired it before you had all the required documents. You added that you repeatedly told the police and the officer that the passport was genuine but that you had forgotten or skipped a step in obtaining it. The RPD then asked you if it was true that you had stated that you had fraudulently obtained your passport. You replied no, that it was not true, that you had legally acquired your passport in accordance with the law, that because of problems you had, your obtaining your passport was made easier for you by skipping a step, that is, by presenting the marriage certificate, but you obtained it officially.106 In the interview, you stated that it was a real passport but that it had been obtained by presenting false information.107 However, the reliability of a passport is dependent on the reliability of the documents used to obtain it.108 Based on my analysis of your record, the RPD did not err in finding that that document was false, not giving any weight to it and drawing a negative inference about your credibility.109\n[74] With respect to the special travel document that was issued to you in Burundi, the RPD found that it did not contain any biometric data and gave it little weight in establishing your identity.110\n[75] I have read the document in question, which was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2014, and expired on XXXX XXXX, 2015. It is true that it includes a photograph of you, your surname, your given name, your place and date of birth, XXXX 1966, and your address, XXXX. It also indicates that you have no profession,111 which is not consistent with the information that you provided on immigration form IMM 5669, namely that you were a self-employed worker who owned a XXXX from XXXX 1994 to XXXX 1995.112 I also note that the place of birth indicated on the document is not consistent either with what you provided on immigration form 0008, namely XXXX.113\n[76] I agree with you that that document is a pass and that it allowed you to travel in the three countries that recognize it, namely the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi and Rwanda, given that it is the citizens of these three countries who benefit from it.114 I also agree with you that that document includes relevant information about you and that the RPD erred in finding that it contains no biometric data.\n[77] That said, the RPD nonetheless assigned some weight to this document. Based on my own analysis of your record, the document cannot be analyzed independently of the other documents you presented to the RPD. Compared to a national identity card or passport, it seems clear to me that this document does not have the same weight in establishing an individual's national identity. In any event, I am aware that excessive reliance should not be placed on such a classification and that it is important to independently assess all of the documents submitted in evidence.115 Even giving it some weight, I am of the opinion that this document is not sufficient on its own, at the time of your refugee protection claim and your appeal, to establish that you are in fact a citizen of Burundi, as the document has not been valid since XXXX XXXX, 2015, and contains information that differs from what you provided on your immigration forms.\nThe Refugee Protection Division adequately analyzed the evidence of your spouse's identity\n[78] In your memorandum, you submit that your former counsel failed to inform you of the need to provide documents or testimony to corroborate your spouse's identity, which explains why no documents or testimony were provided to prove her identity. You also submit that the failure to inform you of this had an impact on the member's decision, since the decision is based on the evidence submitted.\n[79] I am not persuaded by these arguments.\n[80] First, it is wrong to claim that no documents or testimony were provided to prove her identity. As indicated by the RPD in its decision, four documents were submitted and analyzed to prove her identity: a national identity card from Burundi, a Rwandan passport, a marriage certificate and an excerpt of a marriage certificate.116 Each of these documents was carefully analyzed by the Minister's representative and the RPD. You and your spouse were asked about the problems in each of these documents.117 I would add that your spouse was also asked by the RPD about a fifth document, the Rwandan national identity card on which the signature does not match her signature on her BOC Form.118\n[81] Second, with respect to your former counsel's conduct, I note that he did not respond to the message sent to him by your current counsel, even though you had authorized him to release solicitor-client privilege to respond to your allegations of professional negligence.119 According to the Practice Notice on Allegations Against Former Counsel, had he intended to respond, your former counsel should have provided a written response no later than ten days after receiving your allegations.120 He did not do so. For your part, again according to the Practice Notice, if you had made a complaint against your former counsel to his provincial law society, you could have done so and, had you done so, you would have been required to provide us with a copy of that complaint.121 You did not do so.\n[82] Obviously, it is essential for an immigration advisor or counsel to demonstrate competence with their clients and provide adequate representation.122 Based on my own analysis of your record, given that I do not have access to the private exchanges between you and your former counsel, I am not persuaded by your allegations.\n[83] First, I note that your BOC Form indicates that this counsel helped you complete your forms.123 Your BOC Form clearly indicates that you are required to obtain and submit any documents to the IRB in support of your refugee protection claim, including identity documents, and that you are required to submit two copies of them without delay.124 In signing her BOC Form on XXXX XXXX, 2018, your spouse declared that she could read French and that she was able to fully understand the contents of the form.125\n[84] Furthermore, at the start of the hearing, after identifying the documents that had been filed in evidence before it, including the Minister's intervention with his documents and your own documents, the RPD indicated that it would first address the issue of your identity and asked you and your spouse if you were ready to proceed. Both of you replied yes.126 Your former counsel also indicated that everything was complete in relation to your documents.127 In my view, your former counsel remained alert throughout the hearing and intervened to ensure your own statements were better understood.128 He did not ask you any questions, but he presented submissions in support of your testimonies and the identity documents analyzed during the hearing.129\n[85] That said, even accepting that your former counsel did not inform you of your obligation to provide documents to prove your spouse's identity, I find that simply reading your BOC Form would have shown that you had such an obligation to obtain all identity documents, including birth certificates, and to submit them without delay. I also find that the way the hearing was conducted and the fact that you were questioned about several identity documents concerning you, your spouse and your two sons, ensured that natural justice and procedural fairness were respected and that you had the opportunity to tender any evidence that supported your claims, including with regard to your identity.130 In short, even accepting that your former counsel failed to mention your obligation to provide documents to prove your spouse's identity, in my view, that omission had no impact on the RPD's decision concerning her identity.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not focus on the interview conducted at the port of entry\n[86] Finally, in your memorandum, you submit that the RPD's decision placed considerable emphasis on the statements made at the border, where the Federal Court has repeatedly cautioned against placing too much emphasis on such statements.\n[87] With respect for your argument, I consider it to be unfounded.\n[88] I agree with you that care must be taken before questioning the credibility of a claimant based on omissions between a document signed at the port of entry upon arriving in Canada and the subsequent content of the BOC Form.131 The same reasoning can apply to statements made in an interview when an individual arrives and claims refugee protection in Canada.\n[89] During the hearing, the RPD and the Minister's representative sometimes referred to statements you made during the interview with a Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer. For example, the Minister's representative asked you to explain why, during that interview, you stated that you were only a citizen of Burundi and no other country. You replied that you did not remember saying that. The Minister's representative also asked your spouse to explain why she had replied at that interview that she had no nationalities other than Rwandan. Your spouse initially replied that, if she responded no at the time, it was because she knew being Rwandan was enough. She then replied that, when she was fleeing Rwanda, she was afraid and that a person is often afraid when answering questions. The Minister's representative also asked you to explain why, during the interview, you referred to certificates of residence, without any reference to the fact that your wife was Rwandan. You then replied that answers are sometimes given without focusing because of fear. The representative asked you what you were afraid of at that time. You replied that you were afraid that you and your family could be deported, that you had gone through an illegal route, that you were met by armed police officers and that you gave vague answers at that time. The RPD then intervened and pointed out to you that stating that you had a fraudulent Rwandan passport was not vague and that, if someone is afraid, they do not tell an armed police officer that they have a fraudulent document. You replied that you were afraid because there was no Canadian visa in your passport and you had entered illegally.132\n[90] In my view, your explanations themselves are contradictory. In any event, most of the questions you were asked at the RPD hearing were not about the contradictions between your statements at the point of entry and those included on your BOC Forms. Indeed, based on my own analysis of your record, most of the concerns that were identified in the Minister's intervention and in the questions you were asked at the hearing were related to the identity documents that were carefully analyzed. That is obviously an important, even central, aspect of your refugee protection claims.133 In my view, the RPD did not unduly focus on the contradictions between your statements in the interview with a CBSA officer and those in your BOC Form.\nSince your identity was not established, the Refugee Protection Division did not need to analyze your fear\n[91] Since your identity was not established, the RPD did not need to analyze your fear of being persecuted within the meaning of section 96 or of being subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.134\nCONCLUSION\n[92] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD's determination that you have not established your identity and are therefore not a refugee under section 96 or a person in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA.\n[93] Your appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nAlain Bissonnette\nAlain Bissonnette\nMay 11, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Your Basis of Claim Forms (BOC Forms), including the amendments, are reproduced at pages 31 to 79; the documents you entered into evidence are reproduced at pages 289 to 313; and the general list of documents is reproduced at page 80 of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) record.\n2 Transcript of the RPD hearing on February 22, 2022, 54 pages, at pages 6, 7 and 9.\n3 The Minister's amended notice of intervention and documents M-1 to M-19, October 13, 2020, are reproduced at pages 323 to 381 of the RPD record.

Her minor children, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX (the minor appellants), are citizens of the United States of America (United States).\n[2] According to their Basis of Claim Forms (BOC Forms), in Ghana they fear the appellant's ex-husband (the ex-husband), whom she married against her will around 20011 because her parents had arranged the marriage for financial reasons. She was a victim of domestic violence throughout her marriage and, in 2007, she took advantage of a trip to the United States to escape this relationship. The appellant obtained a Ghanaian divorce in 2009 and married the father of her eldest daughter, in the United States, the same year. Sponsorship proceedings initiated by him were unsuccessful because of their divorce in 2010, and the appellant then applied for asylum in the United States. Her youngest daughter is from a subsequent relationship. Fearing removal to Ghana after her US asylum application was rejected, the appellants came to Canada to claim refugee protection on May 18, 2018.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected their refugee protection claims. It considered the evidence insufficient to conclude that the appellant is a person referred to in Article 1E of the Convention. The RPD did not examine the credibility of the appellant's allegations of domestic violence at the hands of her ex-husband from 2004 to 2007, but accepted them as true for the purposes of its analysis. However, it considered that the appellant did not establish the well-foundedness of her prospective fear of her ex-husband, 15 years after their separation, or as a divorced woman. The appellant's claim that her ex-husband is angry with her for leaving him and having children with someone else was not established, as she has had no contact with him since 2007 and the divorce was concluded in agreement with both families in 2009. The claim that her ex-husband began making threats in 2017, 10 years after their separation, is not credible because her testimony was vague, evasive and shifting in this regard. Her cousin's letter is also vague as to the nature and timing of the threats, since it states that the appellant's aunt was approached directly by her ex-husband in 2014. The claim that her family has become estranged from her since the divorce and that it will insist that the appellant go back to her ex-husband, for financial reasons, contradicts her statements in her US asylum application. Her convoluted testimony about when and why she became estranged from her family undermines the appellant's credibility, and means that she did not establish that money is an additional reason to fear being sent back to her ex-husband today. Although the appellant faces certain risks as a woman in Ghana, she did not establish that, in her case, there is more than a mere possibility of persecution, taking into account her personal circumstances and the objective evidence. The minor appellants did not establish a well-founded fear or a risk in the event that they return to the United States, and the RPD does not have the jurisdiction to take into account the humanitarian and compassionate considerations raised by the appellants.\n[4] Before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), the appellants argue that the appellant's overall credibility should not be called into question given that the RPD noted no inconsistencies or omissions, let alone contradictions that could undermine her credibility. The RPD underestimated the nature of the risk and failed to rigorously apply the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Guideline 4), which requires that social, cultural, traditional and religious norms, etc., be taken into account in assessing the feared harm. The RPD failed to note that the groups of women referred to in the documentation it cited do not constitute an exhaustive list. The RPD seems to have failed to take into account the context that led to the appellant's marriage to her ex-husband, now a potential agent of persecution. Her ex-husband stated that he did not forgive the appellant for the money spent for her trip to the United States. The subjective fear that she expressed is an objectively well-founded fear, based both on the documentation and on her oral testimony at the hearing. The RPD erred in relying on the appellant's age and education to exclude her from the registry of people who could be persecuted, since culture and tradition continue to be at the forefront of people's minds. The RPD itself acknowledged that, despite a legal system that cracks down on the harassment of women in the workplace, this remains a common practice. Despite the statutory and jurisdictional authorities cited by the RPD, Ghana continues to be a country where respect for human rights remains a challenge, and several categories of women continue to be subjected to the worst forms of persecution.\n[5] The determinative issue for the RAD is credibility, specifically, the credibility of the evidence relating to the prospective fear.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in determining that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nINDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BY THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[7] My role is to review all the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.2 To this end, I have considered Guideline 4.\nThe RPD was correct in finding that the appellant is not credible with respect to threats made after 2007 and that she did not establish that, in her case, there is a serious possibility of persecution by her ex-husband or his family on a forward-looking basis. It correctly took into account Guideline 4.\n[8] Several times in their memorandum, the appellants argue that the appellant's overall credibility should not be called into question given that the RPD noted no inconsistencies or omissions, let alone contradictions that could undermine her credibility.\n[9] With respect, I disagree with this for several reasons. First, the RPD was careful to point out that it accepted as true that the appellant had been a victim of domestic violence from 2004 to 2007, although it did not assess credibility in this regard. I will apply the same presumption, even though I note certain inconsistencies that predate 2007, because the appellant did not have the opportunity to provide explanations for them.\n[10] Nevertheless, assuming that these events, which predate 2007, were established in no way diminishes the credibility issues noted with regard to subsequent events.\n[11] For example, the appellant testified at the hearing that her ex-husband began making threats in 2017, 10 years after their separation. I agree with the RPD that this statement is not credible. As the RPD correctly pointed out, the appellant tried to change the subject when asked whether any of her family members had been approached directly by her ex-husband, which already undermines her credibility. She then testified that she had found out from her cousin, who in turn had found out from friends who had heard the threats. However, she adjusted her testimony to finally state that her ex-husband had gone to the home of her cousin's mother, her aunt. This late and changing testimony again undermines the appellant's credibility. Next, her cousin's letter states that her mother was visited by the ex-husband in 2014 and that the threats resumed in 2017, which is yet another version as to when her ex-husband began making threats after 2007. This again undermines the credibility of this evidence. The RPD did not err in this regard.\n[12] I would add that, in my view, the appellant's failure to mention these important facts about the prospective fear in her BOC Form and to state under oath that the BOC Form is complete also undermines her credibility, regardless of the version that should be accepted. I consider that it is worth noting that the appellant is an educated woman who has completed XXXX years of XXXX-XXXX education, that she drafted her BOC Form in English without the assistance of an interpreter, and that she was assisted by a lawyer when the document was drafted and at the hearing.\n[13] I will focus on this one example because the appellants do not specify where in the RPD decision the alleged overall credibility should have led to the multiple credibility issues noted by the RPD being given the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, these arguments do not meet the requirements of paragraph 3(3)(g) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules), which sets out the obligation to present full and detailed submissions regarding the errors made with references as to where those errors are located in the written reasons for the decision or in the transcript or in any audio recording.\n[14] The same applies to the appellants' arguments that the RPD underestimated the nature of the risk and did not rigorously apply Guideline 4, which requires that social, cultural, traditional and religious norms, etc., be taken into account in assessing the feared harm.\n[15] The appellants do not explain the nature of the risk that the RPD allegedly failed to consider, nor which social, cultural, traditional and religious norms it failed to take into account. They do not indicate specifically where the RPD erred. These arguments do not meet the requirements of paragraph 3(3)(g) of the RAD Rules. That, in my opinion, is enough to reject them.\n[16] Nevertheless, I would add that, in my opinion, the RPD considered Guideline 4, as it stated, and it did not underestimate the nature of the risk. It relied on the absence of credible evidence concerning each of the appellant's claims that would establish the prospective risk, providing reasons in each separate case.\n[17] The RPD correctly noted the evidence, according to which the appellant has had no contact with her ex-husband since 2007, that the divorce was concluded in agreement with both families in 2009, and that the claims that her ex-husband made threats for whatever reason thereafter were not established.\n[18] The appellants do not explicitly challenge the conclusions that the appellant did not establish that her ex-husband is angry with her for leaving him and having children with someone else, that her family has estranged itself from her since the divorce and will insist that the appellant return to her ex-husband for financial reasons, and that the minor appellants did not establish a well-founded fear or a risk in the event that they return to the United States. Based on my own analysis, these conclusions are correct.\n[19] I would also add that none of these allegations relating to a prospective risk are stated in the BOC Form and that the appellant made a solemn affirmation at the beginning of the hearing that the BOC Form was complete. Once again, this undermines the credibility of all of these allegations.\n[20] It was not established that there are any social, cultural, traditional or religious norms that would justify the appellant having difficulty in testifying consistently with regard to the facts that she alleges, leading to a prospective risk, namely, essentially, the question of whether her ex-husband made threats after 2007 or after the amicable divorce in 2009, for any reason.\n[21] With regard to her ex-husband's threat that he would never forgive the appellant for the money he spent for her trip to the United States, it follows that since contact with the family through whom this threat was allegedly made was not credibly established, this threat was not established either.\n[22] In short, I consider that the RPD was correct in concluding that the appellant is not credible with respect to the threats made after 2007 and that she did not establish a serious possibility of persecution by her ex-husband or his family on a forward-looking basis. It correctly took into account Guideline 4.\nThe RPD was correct in concluding that the appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution because of her profile as a divorced single mother.\n[23] After concluding that the appellant had not established a well-founded fear of her ex-husband on a forward-looking basis, the RPD assessed the possibility of persecution because of her profile as a divorced single mother. It considered numerous pieces of evidence in the National Documentation Package, which it summarized in the decision.\n[24] The appellants argue that the RPD failed to note that the groups of women referred to in the documentation it cited do not constitute an exhaustive list. The RPD seems to have failed to take into account the context that led to the appellant's marriage to her ex-husband, now a potential agent of persecution.\n[25] The RPD did not claim that the lists of persons named in the documents it cited are exhaustive, and I have already explained why I consider that the appellant's prospective fear of her ex-husband is unfounded. Therefore, the RPD did not err in this regard.\n[26] The appellants argue that RPD erred in relying on the appellant's age and education to exclude her from the registry of people who could be persecuted, as culture and tradition continue to be at the forefront of people's minds.\n[27] That is not how I interpreted the RPD's reasons. It did not claim that the appellant's age and level of education are sufficient to exclude her from all the persecution that women in Ghana are subjected to.\n[28] It noted that, according to the documentary evidence, adolescent girls, young women, young girls from rural areas, those at risk of forced marriage and those who are forced into marriage because they are pregnant face a greater risk of violence. It also cited the objective evidence according to which poor women who have no formal education are often targeted.\n[29] The RPD was correct in concluding that the appellant's age distinguishes her from these first five groups and that her level of education distinguishes her from the last one. It did not claim that those are the only two factors that distinguish her from those groups and from the others it listed in the decision. Those were just two of the factors it took into account. For example, the RPD also noted that the appellant benefits from a large family. Therefore, the RPD did not err in this regard.\n[30] Although the discrimination and harassment of women in the workplace remain common, the documentary evidence indicates that these practices are less prevalent in urban areas, as the RPD correctly noted.\n[31] Lastly, the appellants argue that, despite statutory and jurisdictional authorities, cited by the RPD, Ghana continues to be a country where respect for human rights remains a challenge, and several categories of women continue to be subjected to the worst forms of persecution.\n[32] The RPD agrees that this is the case. However, the evidence does not support that all women face a serious possibility of persecution, especially since the appellant's cousin, aunt and a female friend live alone without being subjected to such problems. It is up to the appellants to establish that they have a profile whereby they face more than a mere possibility of persecution. They failed to discharge that burden. The RPD did not err in this regard.\nCredibility finding and conclusion regarding a prospective risk.\n[33] For all the above-mentioned reasons, I conclude, as the RPD correctly did, that the appellant is not credible with respect to the well-foundedness of her prospective fear of persecution or the existence of a prospective risk under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[34] As I have already stated, the appellants are not challenging the RPD's conclusions that the minor appellants did not establish a well-founded fear or a risk in the event that they return to the United States. I am of the opinion that those conclusions are correct.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in determining that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMichel Colin\nMe Michel Colin\nFebruary 21, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 According to her Basis of Claim Form, she was married around 2001, but according to her marriage certificate C-13, she was married on XXXX XXXX, 2004.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They are appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting their refugee protection claim for lack of credibility.\n[3] The appellants fear that, should they return to the DRC, they will be arrested, tortured, and killed by the military, police, and civilian authorities and the DRC's Agence Nationale de Renseignements (ANR) [national intelligence agency], because the male appellant allegedly witnessed the massacres committed by these authorities against the civilian population in Grand Kasai.\n[4] In their appeal memorandum, the appellants' counsel submits that:\n- The RPD deliberately refused to carefully read his clients' Basis of Claim Forms (BOC Forms) because it analyzed the case on the basis of preconceived ideas.\n- His client has XXXX XXXX.\n- The RPD exaggerated the content of his clients' BOC Forms.\n- The RPD failed to understand that his client had given two dates for the threats allegedly made against him: one being the date they began and the other being the date they continued.\n- The RPD did not apply the presumption of truthfulness.\n- His client suffers from health problems that affected his XXXX.\n[5] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the appellants' credibility.\n[6] I find that the appellants are not credible and that the RPD's decision is correct.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[7] The RPD hearing took place on March 23, 2022. The decision was rendered on May 5, 2022. The RAD must assess the admissibility of new evidence under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and the Raza1 criteria as adapted in Singh,2 since it was not part of the RPD record.\n[8] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA provides that, on appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present to the RAD only evidence that arose after the rejection of their refugee protection claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[9] New evidence that meets at least one of these requirements must also meet the three jurisprudential criteria of credibility, relevance, and newness.\n[10] The male appellant submitted an affidavit, asking that it be considered as new evidence; I have labelled it A-1. He also presented a document entitled [translation] \"Patient Visit Information\" dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, which I have labelled A-2.\n[11] The appellants have not made submissions to explain how this new evidence complies with the relevant legislation and case law.\n[12] I am of the opinion that exhibits A-1 and A-2 do not comply with the statutory and case law requirements for the admission of new evidence. Therefore, for the reasons that follow, I do not accept this evidence.\n[13] The male appellant's affidavit: Although it post-dates the RPD's decision, this affidavit contains no new information. In his affidavit, the male appellant reiterates his main allegations, namely, that he is being pursued by the Congolese authorities for his imputed political opinion. He criticizes the RPD for incorrectly analyzing his case. I am of the opinion that this affidavit is not relevant, as it does not provide new evidence.\n[14] Exhibit A-2: This is medical information that post-dates the rejection of the appellants' claim. However, it is neither relevant nor new.\n[15] This evidence indicates that the male appellant is being seen by a health professional for a recent onset of XXXX.\n[16] The issue of the male appellant's health problems, as they relate to his argument about XXXX XXXX, was discussed before the RPD. To explain some contradictions in his evidence, the male appellant argued that he has a XXXX XXXX. The RPD noted that no report was filed in support of this allegation. I am of the opinion that in filing Exhibit A-2, the appellants are trying to complete evidence the RPD considered deficient.\n[17] In addition to the fact that the purpose of an appeal before the RAD is not to perfect evidence already analyzed by the RPD, I find that this evidence does not mention any problems with the male appellant's XXXX, either before or at the time of the RPD hearing. It concerns another illness. I understand that the purpose of filing this evidence is to establish that the male appellant had health problems that affected his XXXX. However, notwithstanding their argument, the appellants do not explain how this illness, which was discovered a few weeks after the RPD hearing, could have altered the male appellant's XXXX during his testimony. I have no evidence. Neither the appellants' nor their counsel's submissions constitute scientific expertise.\n[18] I am sympathetic to the male appellant's illness, but I am of the opinion that this document is not relevant and does not add any new information to support the appellants' allegations, to substantiate their claim or to establish that the male appellant may have XXXX XXXX.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n[19] The female appellant is basing her refugee protection claim on the male appellant's allegations.\n[20] The male appellant's allegations are contained in his BOC Form. Mainly, he alleges that in XXXX 2016, he survived the massacres committed by the Congolese authorities against civilians in Grand Kasai, where he is from. He adds that he was an eyewitness to these massacres. The male appellant states that he XXXX XXXX a delegation (XXXX XXXX (KM)) in order to prepare for the peace conference in Grand Kasai, which was held on September 19, 2017. He states that he XXXX XXXX XXXX of the civilian and military officials who committed the massacres and that he started receiving threats XXXX XXXX after the conference. He writes in his BOC Form that he was arrested and tortured by the Congolese authorities in XXXX 2017 because of his XXXX XXXX the KM delegation.\n[21] Acquaintances allegedly helped the male appellant escape from his prison. He adds that he hid at the home of a friend (JC). He states that he left the DRC for Canada with the intention of returning to his country when the situation calmed down.\n[22] While he was in Canada, his friend JC informed him that the Congolese authorities were still looking for him. These authorities allegedly killed his friend JC because he tried to help him XXXX against those responsible for the massacres in Grand Kasai. The appellants stated that, following this incident, they changed their minds and claimed refugee protection.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[23] The RAD's role is not to carry out a de novo consideration of refugee protection claims, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged. The RAD may apply a deferential standard in certain circumstances.3 The RAD reviews RPD decisions, applying the correctness standard after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it.4\n[24] I have conducted my own review of the RPD record and the male appellant's record. I have applied the correctness standard in this case.\nANALYSIS\nThe male appellant is not credible\n[25] After analyzing the evidence, including the appellants' testimony, I find that they are not credible for the following reasons.\nWitness of the massacres in the male appellant's village\n[26] The RPD considered that the male appellant did not establish that he had witnessed the massacres that took place in his village. It drew a negative credibility inference.\n[27] Counsel for the appellants submits that the RPD deliberately refused to carefully consider the male appellant's BOC Form, which mentions the violence in Grand Kasai in 2016 and 2017. He adds that the RPD should have understood that the massacres started in 2016 and continued in 2017. He criticizes the RPD for its preconceived ideas in assessing the evidence. Counsel for the appellants argues that his clients did not fail to mention relevant facts or adjust their testimony. He reiterates an argument made before the RPD that his client was suffering from XXXX XXXX.\n[28] I do not agree with the appellants' counsel's arguments. The RPD did not err.\n[29] First, the male appellant's XXXX XXXX have not been established: I consider it important to address this issue of the male appellant's XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX or XXXX at the outset of the analysis of this appeal. This argument has been raised repeatedly since the discussion before the RPD and is at the heart of the appellants' grounds of appeal.\n[30] The male appellant's XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX have not been established. The RPD made it clear to the appellants that there was no psychological report identifying XXXX XXXX caused by any XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the male appellant is experiencing. I agree. Neither the appellants nor their counsel are experts who can attest to the male appellant having any kind of XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I do not accept this argument.\n[31] Second, preconceived ideas on the part of the RPD: The appellants' counsel submits that the RPD had preconceived ideas when assessing his clients' case. He does not identify these preconceived ideas that he is criticizing the RPD for. When I listened to the male appellant's testimony regarding the date of XXXX XXXX, 2017, I asked myself the same question the RPD did: Why did he not mention this important date in his BOC Form? I also asked myself what the connection was with the date of XXXX 2016? As will be seen in the following paragraphs, the appellants were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for this omission. I do not agree with this argument from the appellants' counsel, which has no place in an appeal memorandum, especially when it cannot be demonstrated.\n[32] Third, the male appellant testified that he became a source of embarrassment for the Congolese authorities because he had witnessed the massacres committed by the Congolese armed forces in his village on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The RPD confronted him with the fact that he had not mentioned this date of XXXX XXXX, 2017, in his BOC Form and instead wrote that he had survived the massacres that took place in XXXX 2016 in Central Kasai following the murder of the customary high chief Jean-Prince Mpandi. He acknowledged that he had not mentioned that date. He added that the massacres had spread from Central Kasai to his village, leading to the events of XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[33] The RPD did not err in rejecting these explanations, because they are unsatisfactory.\n[34] The male appellant states that he was persecuted because of the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017, to the KM delegation about the massacres committed by the Congolese military on XXXX XXXX, 2017, hence the importance of the information about these massacres, which are central to the appellants' allegations. I consider that the RPD was right to inquire about the subject of the male appellant's XXXX, which is the alleged source of these problems with the Congolese authorities.\n[35] The RPD did not err in noting that there was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX difference between the two dates. This is a discrepancy that raises questions and can only give rise to doubts as to the truthfulness of the appellants' allegations if they are not satisfactorily explained.\n[36] I do not accept the appellants' arguments, which reiterate the explanations they gave the RPD that the clashes started in XXXX 2016 and spread to their village in XXXX 2017. The male appellant stated that he is being persecuted by his country's authorities because of his XXXX concerning facts and massacres that he allegedly saw and witnessed personally in his village on the specific date of XXXX XXXX, 2017. The male appellant did not report that he was being persecuted because he witnessed all of the massacres that allegedly occurred between Grand Kasai and his village between XXXX 2016 and XXXX 2017. It follows that the argument that the clashes or attacks started in XXXX 2016 and continued until XXXX 2017 is irrelevant and does not address this failure to mention the date of XXXX XXXX, 2017, in his BOC Form. The RPD is correct that the male appellant attempted to adjust his testimony when confronted about this omission.\n[37] As I will discuss later, the appellants and the RPD debated another issue related to this, namely, whether the male appellant witnessed the massacres in question on XXXX XXXX, 2017, during the day or at night. This further undermines the appellants' arguments that these events extended from XXXX 2016 to XXXX 2017.\n[38] Unless a satisfactory explanation is provided, the fact that material information-the date of the massacres that were the subject of the male appellant's XXXX XXXX the KM delegation and the alleged cause of his persecution by the Congolese authorities-was not spontaneously mentioned in his written account can only undermine his credibility. The male appellant failed to meet his evidentiary burden. I consider that he has not established the truthfulness of the allegation that on XXXX XXXX, 2017, he witnessed massacres committed by the Congolese authorities in his village. The male appellant is not credible. The RPD's conclusion is correct.\nWitness of the authorities responsible for the massacres in the male appellant's village\n[39] The RPD considered that the male appellant's written account and testimony were contradictory regarding the identities of the officials whom he allegedly witnessed committing the massacres in his village. It did not accept the appellants' explanations and drew a negative inference.\n[40] Counsel for the appellants submits that his clients used exaggerated terms in their written account, but that this should not be cause for drawing a negative inference about their credibility. He adds that the male appellant testified before the RPD that the people who committed the massacres came during the day to identify the houses to be attacked. According to counsel, it is more likely than not that the assailants came during the day because [translation] \"visiting during the day while the sun was out was an excellent way to be able to recognize the same houses in the evening, at the time of the massacres.\"5 He states that, in the DRC and in Black Africa, houses are not numbered, which makes it impossible to write down or indicate remotely which houses to attack without making mistakes.\n[41] I do not agree with these arguments. The RPD did not err.\n[42] Before the RPD, the male appellant testified that he saw those responsible for the massacres that occurred in his village on XXXX XXXX, 2017. When asked to name the people he saw massacring civilians in his village, the male appellant named two XXXX who were members of the civil authorities and who were allegedly responsible for telling the soldiers which houses to attack. He added that he saw some soldiers, but did not know their names. The RPD confronted him with the fact that this testimony contradicted his written account, in which he alleges that when the KM delegation XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017, he gave them the names of a few civilian and military authorities involved in the massacres he witnessed. The male appellant explained that there was no difference because the military and police authorities responsible are still there.6\n[43] The RPD was right not to accept this explanation, which is not satisfactory.\n[44] As noted above, the event that gave rise to the alleged persecution against the appellants is the male appellant's XXXX XXXX the KM delegation against the civilian and military officials who allegedly committed the massacres in his village. Furthermore, the panel was told that it was because of this XXXX XXXX the KM delegation that he was arrested and tortured in XXXX 2017. Therefore, I consider the information relating to this XXXX XXXX the KM delegation to be important and central to the appellants' allegations. In particular, the fact that the male appellant XXXX XXXX, both civilian and military, would certainly give his XXXX XXXX this delegation greater impact and be more disturbing to the authorities who, according to the appellants, wanted to silence him.\n[45] For a decision-maker in a refugee protection claim, in order to correctly assess the extent and seriousness of the male appellant's XXXX XXXX the KM delegation, and unless a satisfactory explanation is provided, it is legitimate to expect consistent and coherent information on this XXXX XXXX the KM delegation. The discrepancy between the written account and his testimony, with respect to the content of the male appellant's XXXX XXXX the KM delegation, is troubling because it has not been satisfactorily explained. It is reasonable to wonder whether it is true that the male appellant XXXX the KM delegation XXXX XXXX of civilians and military members who were allegedly responsible for the massacres he allegedly witnessed.\n[46] In my opinion, if the male appellant had actually XXXX XXXX XXXX of civilian and military officials who committed these massacres, he should have been able to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to the RPD. If he cannot, he must give a satisfactory explanation. The male appellant did not state that he does not remember the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I consider that his response that he did not know XXXX XXXX clearly contradicts his written statement that he had XXXX both civilians and soldiers who were involved in these massacres.\n[47] I do not agree with the appellants that the RPD erred as to the meaning of the phrase [translation] \"some XXXX\" that they used in their account. In order to make the male appellant's written account agree with his testimony before the RPD, the appellants are attempting, unnecessarily, to rely on a \"linguistic\" argument that does not resolve this contradiction.\n[48] In my opinion, this contradiction is dangerous. It calls into question the truthfulness of the male appellant's allegations that he witnessed the massacres or that he knew the XXXX of the officials who committed these massacres in his village or even that he gave any XXXX XXXX the KM delegation, which is what supposedly led to his alleged persecution by the Congolese authorities. I consider that he has not established that he saw the perpetrators of the massacres in his village.\n[49] I consider the RPD's reasoning to be correct and consistent because it demonstrates that the RPD analyzed the evidence as a whole. The male appellant failed to establish that he was a witness or that he saw the massacres allegedly committed in his village.\n[50] The male appellant's credibility is further complicated when it comes to determining whether he was present when the massacres that were allegedly the subject of his XXXX XXXX the KM delegation took place on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[51] The male appellant stated in his written account and testimony that he left the village before the massacres began. He added that this was because of a telephone call from a prominent friend in Kasai who asked him to leave the village because he had information that the military and police were going to attack the appellants' village. He stated that when the weapons started firing, he had already left the village.7 This was why the RPD asked him to explain how he could have seen the massacres allegedly committed on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and those responsible for them. The male appellant responded that on XXXX XXXX, 2017, during the day, he saw the XXXX going around with the soldiers to show them which houses to attack, as well as how to enter and exit.8 He added and clarified that on the evening of XXXX XXXX, 2017, he received the call from his friend, the prominent person in Kasai, who encouraged him to leave, which he did before the massacres began.\n[52] The RPD did not err in concluding that the male appellant cannot confirm that the people he saw during the day were the people who allegedly committed the massacres on the evening of XXXX XXXX, 2017. In other words, if the male appellant left the village before the attacks began, he could not possibly have seen with his own eyes the acts of massacre or the people who allegedly committed those killings. I agree with the RPD that the male appellant's allegations are based on assumptions.\n[53] I do not agree with the appellants' submissions that coming during the day, while the sun was out, was an \"excellent way\" for the assailants to be able to recognize the same houses in the evening during the massacre. They do not indicate how the RPD erred. I also do not accept the argument that houses in the DRC and in Black Africa are not numbered as a response to the RPD's conclusion that the male appellant's explanations are hypothetical and contradict his assertion that he saw the perpetrators of the massacre on XXXX XXXX, 2017. In addition to the fact that the appellants did not testify to this before the RPD, it is unclear to me how this [translation] \"idea of the soldiers to visit during the day, while the sun was out\" can establish that the male appellant witnessed the massacre or those responsible for it. It is not a question of war tactics in this case, but of establishing the consistency and veracity of the appellants' allegations that the male appellant saw the people who committed the massacre. Since the male appellant states that he left the village before the attacks began, it must be inferred that he could not have seen the massacre or those responsible for the killings, regardless of the tactics of those responsible for them.\n[54] The appellants' arguments do not respond to the RPD's questions concerning whether or not the male appellant witnessed the massacre and those who committed the killings, given that he left the village before the attacks began.\n[55] In my opinion, the male appellant has not established that he witnessed the massacre or saw the alleged perpetrators. This must have an impact on the truthfulness of his allegations that he XXXX XXXX the KM delegation on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and that he witnessed the massacres and saw those responsible for it. The male appellant is not credible. The RPD's conclusion is correct.\nDeath threats\n[56] There is a contradiction between the male appellant's testimony and his written account with respect to when the authorities in his country began to threaten him. In his testimony before the RPD, he stated that he started receiving threats on XXXX XXXX, 2017, when he XXXX XXXX the KM delegation. However, in his written account, he states that these threats started XXXX XXXX XXXX the peace conference in Grand Kasai, which took place on September 19, 2019. The RPD did not accept the male appellant's explanations regarding this contradiction and drew a negative inference.\n[57] The appellants submit that the RPD was mistaken in thinking that the male appellant was tying the onset of the threats to a particular event. They add that the RPD was speculating with respect to the male appellant's answers. They criticize the RPD for not applying the presumption of truthfulness.\n[58] In my opinion, the RPD did not err.\n[59] The male appellant testified before the RPD that the threats began a few XXXX XXXX the departure of the people who questioned him on XXXX XXXX, 2017. However, the RPD confronted him with the fact that his written account states that the threats started XXXX XXXX after the peace conference in Grand Kasai, which was held on September 19, 2017, to which he replied that the threats started after he XXXX XXXX the delegation and before the conference took place. He added that, since receiving the threats, he has stopped leaving his house.9\n[60] The RPD was correct not to accept that explanation, as it is not satisfactory.\n[61] Contrary to the appellants' arguments, it appears from the male appellant's testimony that the beginning of the threats is tied to an event, namely, the XXXX XXXX the KM delegation, which supposedly took place on XXXX XXXX, 2017. This testimony is inconsistent with his written account, in which he clearly states that the threats started after the peace conference in Grand Kasai, held on September 19, 2017. The appellants' submission that the threats started on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and continued after September 19, 2017, cannot be accepted, as this information is not in their written account and is inconsistent with both their written account and their testimony. The male appellant provided two dates for when the threats started. The start of the threats made by the Congolese authorities against the male appellant is an important fact, because it also helps to pinpoint when he started to fear his agents of persecution.\n[62] The authorities' threats and actions against the male appellant are central to the allegations underlying this refugee protection claim. It is therefore important to situate when the alleged threats began. The written account ties the start of the threats to a particular event. However, the male appellant's testimony tied them to another, different event. The male appellant has not offered a satisfactory explanation for this inconsistency in the dates he provided. This contradiction undermines the appellants' credibility.\n[63] In addition, when asked how he had received these threats, the male appellant replied that some acquaintances who had attended the peace conference in Grand Kasai had informed him that his name was on a blacklist of people who were a problem for the authorities. The RPD rightly considered this response to be inconsistent with his testimony that the threats had started before the conference took place, a few XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with the delegation on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[64] The appellants argue that this information, which came to light after the conference, is unrelated to the issue of when the threats started.\n[65] I disagree, because the RPD asked when the male appellant had received these threats. In my opinion, it is logical for the panel to question him about how he received these threats. This is an integral part of the issue of when the threats began. In addition, it should be noted that, when asked whether he had attended the peace conference, the male appellant answered that he had not, because he was not leaving his home due to the threats he had allegedly received a few XXXX XXXX XXXX with the KM delegation on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The male appellant's response that he had received these threats from people who had attended the conference, which was held on September 19, 2017, is inconsistent with his testimony before the RPD that he started receiving threats within XXXX XXXX XXXX with the delegation and before the conference took place.\n[66] This inconsistency, which has not been satisfactorily explained, is troubling because it is not known when he started receiving the threats that are the basis for his refugee protection claim. If it is true that he received information about the threats against him after the conference on September 19, 2017, it becomes impossible that those threats started a few XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with the KM delegation and before this peace conference was held. This also contradicts his testimony that he did not attend that conference because he was afraid for his life as a result of threats allegedly made prior to September 19, 2017.\n[67] The RPD did not err in giving no weight to the documents filed by the appellants, namely, an article on the peace forum in Grand Kasai and an article on the trial for the murder of two UN experts responsible for investigating mass graves linked to the armed conflict in Grand Kasai.\n[68] The appellants criticize the RPD, arguing that if it accepts the content of the first article about the rebuilding in Grand Kasai, it must accept that the massacre alleged by the male appellant took place. They add that these articles bolster their allegation that the massacre in Grand Kasai indeed occurred.\n[69] I do not agree with the appellants.\n[70] The central allegations underlying the appellants' refugee protection claim were not aimed at establishing the occurrence of clashes and massacres in Grand Kasai. The appellants' allegations were unrelated to this issue. The appellants had the burden of establishing the truthfulness of the allegations that the male appellant had seen and witnessed the massacres that occurred in his village on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and that he had seen the perpetrators of these killings and had XXXX XXXX XXXX to the KM delegation. These are the alleged events that were the basis for his alleged persecution by the Congolese authorities.\n[71] The clashes that took place in Grand Kasai between 2016 and 2017 following the appointment of customary chief Jean-Prince Mpandi are documented. The rebuilding in this region and the trial related to the murders of UN members who worked in the region have nothing to do with the allegations at the heart of this refugee protection claim. In my opinion, these documents fail to remedy the appellant's credibility problems, in that they do not show that he XXXX the perpetrators of this massacre, that he witnessed the killings or that he saw the people who attacked the UN members. I consider the RPD's conclusion concerning these documents to be correct.\n[72] While the case law has recognized the principle that a claimant's testimony is presumed to be true, it should be remembered that this presumption can be rebutted. In this case, the male appellant's credibility problems are significant and have still not been satisfactorily explained. The case law has established that the presumption of truthfulness can be set aside in the presence of credibility problems for which the claimant has provided no explanation. This is the case here.\n[73] As I noted above, the RPD analyzed all of the appellants' evidence and formed its opinion after assessing all of that evidence. The male appellant did not establish that on XXXX XXXX, 2017, he witnessed the massacres allegedly committed in his village. He did not establish that he saw those responsible for the massacres in his village. It follows that he did not establish that he XXXX XXXX the KM delegation on XXXX XXXX, 2017, about these alleged massacres on XXXX XXXX, 2017, or the perpetrators. It is clear that the death threats that were a consequence of his alleged XXXX XXXX the KM delegation have not been established and are not credible. In my opinion, the appellants' credibility is seriously undermined by this series of credibility problems. Therefore, the RPD's conclusion is correct.\nCommunications with his friend who stayed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the circumstances of his death\n[74] The RPD concluded that the male appellant had not established the truthfulness of the allegation that he had remained in constant contact with his friend JC. It also did not believe the allegation that JC had told the male appellant that the authorities in his country were looking for him. The RPD did not find credible the allegation that this friend had been killed because he had tried to help him XXXX in the DRC about the massacre allegedly committed in his village by Congolese military and police forces. It drew a negative inference as to the appellants' credibility.\n[75] The appellants' explanation is that these contradictions and inconsistencies are the result of the male appellant's medical condition.\n[76] The RPD did not err.\n[77] The panel recalls the male appellant's statement that when he arrived in Canada, he did not intend to remain here; he wanted to stay until the situation in his country had stabilized.\n[78] Two days before his RPD hearing, the male appellant provided additional information, a document signed on March 21, 2022, in which he explains that he had remained in constant contact with his friend JC to inquire about developments regarding the situation in his country. In this supplementary document, he states that his ongoing communication with his friend and his friend's desire to help him XXXX about the massacre in his village cost him his life. However, before the RPD, he testified that he had spoken to JC for the last time on XXXX XXXX, 2021. He stated that his friend died on XXXX XXXX, 2021. When asked whether he had had any other contact with his friend JC, apart from on XXXX XXXX, 2021, the male appellant replied that his last previous contact with him was on XXXX XXXX, 2019, stating that he had not spoken to or contacted JC between those two dates.\n[79] When confronted with the contradiction between his testimony and his written account with respect to his contact with JC, the male appellant replied that he sometimes gets confused, especially since his friend's death. He added that he felt responsible for JC's death.\n[80] In my opinion, the RPD did not err in not accepting this explanation, because it is not satisfactory.\n[81] In my opinion, the RPD was correct in concluding that the male appellant's testimony contradicts his written account stating that he remained in constant contact with JC. The evidence shows that, in fact, the male appellant and JC communicated only twice in two years. This does not show or constitute constant contact between the male appellant and JC.\n[82] The male appellant's supplementary written account was provided to inform the RPD of new facts, which are essentially the efforts of the Congolese authorities to find him in order to arrest and silence him. He allegedly learned this information through his communications with his friend JC. If it is true, this information and these communications are important elements in the appellants' evidence. I have difficulty understanding how the male appellant could describe being in touch on two occasions over the course of two years as constant contact.\n[83] This is not the first contradiction in the male appellant's evidence. He was also unable to explain this new contradiction. This is a problem with respect to the male appellant's credibility. In my opinion, he has not established any health condition that could explain this contradiction.\n[84] The male appellant states that JC was killed by the Congolese authorities because of his communications with the male appellant and because he had tried to help him XXXX about the massacre these authorities committed in his village.\n[85] The RPD considered it odd that JC had agreed, after being in touch with him twice over the course of two years, to assist the male appellant in giving XXXX about the massacre committed in his village by the Congolese authorities, knowing that he was exposing himself to reprisals by the authorities in his country. The RPD's reasoning is correct. In my opinion, JC's alleged decision to defy the authorities in his country by assisting the male appellant is illogical.\n[86] Furthermore, the RPD confronted the male appellant concerning a further contradiction between his testimony and his written account. He testified that his friend was arrested and tortured after he asked him to assist him in giving his XXXX about the massacre, but his written account states that JC was killed in front of his wife. The male appellant explained that this was a mistake in the French, meaning that JC had been beaten [battu], not killed [abattu].\n[87] The appellants argue that this confusion in the French can be explained by the male appellant's level of education.\n[88] The RPD did not err.\n[89] Later in his testimony before the RPD, when questioned about the death of his friend JC, the male appellant told his counsel that JC had been shot and killed. He added that he did not know why he had told the RPD that his friend JC had been arrested and tortured.10\n[90] In my opinion, these contradictions have not been explained and relate to the same issue, which is JC's death. If the story of JC's death is true, and if it is true that it is connected to his attempt to help the male appellant XXXX against those responsible for the killings in his village, I consider the account of JC's death or murder to be very important. It is central to the appellants' allegations. It is reasonable to expect the story to be consistent in both versions, oral or written. However, that is not the case, and the panel does not know the reason for this contradiction.\n[91] Initially, the allegation was that JC had been murdered. Subsequently, the male appellant denied his written version and stated that he had been arrested and tortured, arguing that it was a language mistake in his written account. This attempt to blame a language mistake does not hold for long, because the male appellant returned to his written version when he testified that, contrary to his initial testimony, JC had not been arrested and tortured, but rather shot and killed by the Congolese authorities. He has provided no explanation for this contradiction.\n[92] These contradictions are serious and have not been satisfactorily explained. They undermine the male appellant's credibility.\n[93] Finally, the RPD did not accept a document filed by the appellants, namely a photograph of a gravestone. It does not give it any weight in the appellants' evidence.\n[94] The appellants submit that this document confirms JC's death.\n[95] It cannot be concluded from this photograph that what it shows is JC's gravestone. The date of death shown in the photograph is XXXX XXXX, 2021, yet the date given for JC's death is XXXX XXXX, 2021. JC's name is not on the gravestone. Most importantly, the photograph does not establish the circumstances of JC's death. I am of the opinion that this document does not resolve the appellants' credibility problems. I give it no weight in their evidence.\n[96] I do not believe any of the story regarding JC, namely, the male appellant's ongoing contact with him, that he tried to help him XXXX about the massacre in his village, and that he was murdered because of his ties to the male appellant. The male appellant has not established his allegations regarding JC. He is not credible. The RPD's conclusion is correct.\n[97] Given the multiple contradictions, inconsistencies, and omissions in the evidence in this case, I find that the male appellant's overall credibility has been undermined. Since the female appellant's claim is based on the male appellant's allegations, her credibility is also undermined. I consider that these credibility problems have not been satisfactorily explained. This is sufficient grounds to reject this refugee protection claim.\n[98] The RPD's decision is correct.\nDETERMINATION\n[99] The RAD dismisses the appeal and, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, confirms the RPD's determination that the appellants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nEzzeddine Saidi\nMe Ezzeddine Saidi\nMarch 23, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Raza v.

XXXX XXXX XXXX (Brazilian appellant) is a citizen of Brazil.\n[2] Should the appellants return to Angola, they fear for their lives at the hands of General XXXX XXXX XXXX. In Angola, the appellant was employed in a business owned by this general. Following thefts and a fire at the business, General XXXX XXXX threatened to kill the appellant and his family, as he attributed the incidents at his business to his employees.\n[3] The appellants also fear for their lives should they return to Brazil. Street vendors threatened the appellant with death while he was working as a XXXX XXXX and having to seize their goods. The appellant was also threatened by an associate of General XXXX XXXX whom he met in Brazil.\n[4] The appellants are appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). They argue that the RPD erred in concluding that XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are referred to in Article 1E of the Convention.\n[5] I note that the RPD did not analyze the risk to which the Angolan appellants would be subjected should they return to Angola. Given the evolution of case law1 regarding the need to analyze risk in the country of citizenship when applying the factors set out in Zeng (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Zeng, 2010 FCA 118) [Zeng], I consider that it would have been better for the RPD to analyze this risk. Nevertheless, for the reasons outlined below, I conclude that the RPD's decision is correct. After weighing the factors set out in Zeng, I conclude that the Angolan appellants are persons referred to in Article 1E of the Convention.\n[6] As for the Brazilian appellant, she did not establish a serious possibility of persecution or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, the existence of a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) if she returned to Brazil.\n[7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\nANALYSIS\n[8] As I am required to do, I conducted an independent assessment of the evidence, which included listening to the recording of the RPD hearing. I applied the standard of correctness.2\n[9] With regard to the applicability of the exclusion clause, unless there are errors in the RPD's analysis, I must consider the Angolan appellants' situation on the same day as considered by the RPD, the date of the hearing.3 However, as set out below, I consider that the RPD erred in failing to analyze the risk in Angola. In such a context, in accordance with Majebi, I can consider the issue of exclusion de novo and thus take into account the most recent documentary evidence. That said, I note that the information available in the most recent National Documentation Package on Brazil concerning permanent residency in Brazil and the treatment of Black people in Brazil is essentially the same as that available at the time of the RPD hearing.\nApplicability of exclusion clause 1E\n[10] After considering the appellants' submissions and weighing the factors set out in Zeng (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Zeng, 2010 FCA 118) [Zeng], I conclude that the Angolan appellants are referred to in Article 1E of the Convention.\n[11] Contrary to what the appellants maintain, the mere fact of having lost permanent residence in Brazil at the time of the hearing does not, in itself, preclude the application of exclusion clause 1E.\n[12] Zeng provides that:\n[28] Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\nUncontested findings\n[13] It is important to note that the appellants are not contesting the following RPD findings:\n* The appellants obtained permanent resident status in Brazil.\n* This status is substantially similar to that of Brazilian nationals.\n* They have lost this status since they left Brazil more than two years ago.\n* They could, however, return to Brazil as permanent residents under family reunification, since XXXX was born in Brazil.\n[14] I see no error and agree with these conclusions.\nLoss of status and right of return\n[15] The appellants argue that since they have lost their permanent resident status in Brazil, the RPD erred in concluding that they are referred to in Article 1E of the Convention.\n[16] I agree that the fact that the Angolan appellants lost their permanent resident status in Brazil is a factor that weighs against exclusion.\n[17] That said, as noted above, the appellants are not challenging the RPD's conclusion that they could obtain permanent residency in Brazil again. One of the objectives of Brazilian immigration law is family reunification. This law guarantees migrants the right to be reunited with their children and siblings by allowing them to apply for a residence permit for the purpose of family reunification. Under this law, a visa or residence permit is granted to a person who has a Brazilian child, enabling them to reside in Brazil permanently. According to the website of the Consulate General of Brazil in Montr\u00e9al, there is a family reunification visa that allows family members of a Brazilian citizen to reside permanently in Brazil. You can submit your request online. The persons must then present certain documents to the consulate, including a valid passport, the Brazilian child's birth certificate and a declaration of no criminal record. Although a condition to present proof of valid status in Canada is also mentioned, the information available does not allow us to conclude that asylum seekers would necessarily be denied such a visa because they are refugee protection claimants in Canada.4 I agree with the RPD that the requirements for applying for a family reunification visa are merely administrative formalities. I also note that Brazilian law allows parents of Brazilian children to obtain naturalization after residing in Brazil for one year.5\n[18] In view of the foregoing, I consider that it was incumbent upon the appellants to demonstrate that they could not obtain permanent residence in Brazil.\n[19] Consequently, I conclude that the Angolan appellants have not demonstrated that they would be unable to obtain a family reunion visa outside Brazil and thus regain permanent resident status. In my view, the appellants have not discharged their burden of demonstrating that they could not return to Brazil.6\n[20] This factor weighs in favour of exclusion.\n[21] However, it is important to analyze the risk to which the appellants would be subjected should they return to Brazil.7\n[22] The appellants state that the RPD erred in finding that their credibility was undermined as to the problems they experienced in Brazil and, consequently, in its assessment of the risk to which they would be subjected in Brazil.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in its assessment of the risk in Brazil\n[23] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant's credibility was undermined by his allegations of threats from street vendors and from an associate of General XXXX XXXX. Like the RPD, I conclude that the appellants failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or to demonstrate that they would be subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if they returned to Brazil.\n[24] The appellants argue that the RPD erred in rejecting the appellant's explanations for the late additions to his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form)8 and, by the same token, in finding that he is not credible regarding his allegations of threats in Brazil. They maintain that they complied with the Refugee Protection Division Rules by submitting additions to their BOC Forms 10 days before the hearing. They add that the objective documentary evidence corroborates the security situation in Brazil9 and that the RPD relied on conjecture to find that the appellant is not credible. They also argue that the RPD erred in failing to take into account the appellant's psychological state and the claimants' particular vulnerability. The appellants rely on case law regarding the need to consider evidence concerning a claimant's psychological state, such as psychological evaluation reports or allegations of rape.\n[25] It is important to mention that the appellants did not present any evidence regarding their psychological state other than the appellant's testimony before the RPD regarding fatigue, stress and difficult circumstances upon arrival at the Canadian border. The appellant testified that, when he arrived in Canada in 2019, he was not himself given the harrowing journey to America, which he describes as the road of death.10 The appellants did not submit any expert opinion, such as a psychological evaluation report or medical assessment concerning their psychological condition. I am sensitive to the stress to which refugee protection claimants are subjected. That said, in my opinion, the appellants have not demonstrated the existence of psychological problems that would explain the credibility issues raised by the RPD.\n[26] Regarding the allegations of death threats at the hands of street vendors in Brazil, I agree with the RPD that the existence of death threats by vendors in the course of the appellant's work in Brazil is important information. At the RPD hearing, when questioned as to why the appellants left Brazil, the appellant stated that it was because he had been threatened with death by street vendors. However, in the first version of his BOC Form completed in XXXX 2019, the appellant does not mention these threats. Instead, he states he left Brazil because he came across an associate of General XXXX XXXX near his work.11 In my opinion, the existence of death threats, as well as the allegation that certain vendors knew where the appellant lived and went there to threaten him with death, provides a better understanding of why the appellants made the decision to abandon their legal status in Brazil for an unknown status in third countries. Considering that the appellants were represented by a lawyer when they completed the first version of their BOC Form12 and considering that this version was not completed on the day of their arrival in Canada but nearly two months after their arrival in Canada, I conclude that the RPD did not err in rejecting the appellant's explanations that this was an oversight. It is true that claimants can correct or add to their BOC Forms before the hearing. I draw no negative inference from the fact that the appellants submitted certain additions to their BOC Forms only after being summoned to a hearing. That said, the fact that, in the first version of the BOC Form, the existence of death threats was overlooked as one of the reasons for abandoning their status in Brazil is not a satisfactory explanation.\n[27] In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that the appellant's credibility has been undermined as to his allegations of death threats by street vendors.\n[28] Furthermore, as noted by the RPD, when questioned as to whether he had been physically harassed by the vendors, the appellant stated that he had been slapped. However, this incident was not mentioned either in his BOC Form or spontaneously in his testimony.\n[29] Even if I accepted that such incidents had occurred, as the RPD noted, there have been no further threats against the appellant by street vendors since he left his job in 2019. Consequently, the appellants have not demonstrated the existence of a risk at the hands of street vendors should they return to Brazil.\n[30] With regard to the appellant's allegations that he met an associate of General XXXX XXXX who exclaimed when he saw him, I consider, as did the RPD, that the appellant gave particularly vague and evasive testimony when asked about the circumstances surrounding this incident. First of all, the appellant was unable to say when the incident occurred, other than that it was in early 2019.13 When questioned as to who this person was, the appellant simply repeated what was written in his BOC Form, that is, that he was an associate of the general for whom he had worked.14 The appellant was unable to state the name of this person.15 Asked by RPD to explain why he considers this person is still in Brazil, the appellant replied that it is because they have other companies and branches in Brazil.16 The appellant was asked to explain how he got this information. In my opinion, his testimony was evasive. He replied that at first he did not know, but that he found out before he left. When asked to provide the name of the company, the appellant stated that he did not know.17 Asked whether this person had threatened him, the appellant replied yes. Like the RPD, I consider the appellant's explanation, that he forgot to write this detail in his BOC Form,18 unsatisfactory. In his BOC Form, the appellant only stated that the general's associate exclaimed. However, this is one of the incidents that triggered the appellants' departure from Brazil. In such circumstances, the fact that the appellant was threatened is important information that should have been included in the BOC Form. Like the RPD, I conclude that there is a contradiction in the circumstances surrounding the meeting, namely that the general's associate threatened him rather than exclaimed.\n[31] Considering the appellant's vague and evasive testimony as well as the contradiction as to the circumstances surrounding the meeting with the general's associate, I conclude that the appellant's credibility has been undermined as regards his allegations of a meeting with a close associate of General XXXX XXXX.\n[32] Contrary to the appellants' allegation, the RPD did not fail to conduct a risk assessment under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[33] However, with regard to insecurity in Brazil,19 as the RPD has pointed out, this is a risk to which the majority of people in Brazil are subjected.\n[34] As for the difficulty in finding employment, the appellants have not shown that this difficulty is related to one of the Convention grounds. The documentary evidence also shows that Brazil was in a recession in 2015-2016. The economic recovery of 2017-2019, when the appellants left Brazil, is described as weak.20\n[35] I nevertheless consider that, taken as a whole, the documentary evidence21 shows the existence of racial discrimination and racism in Brazil. That said, the appellant was able to work in Brazil and support his family. The appellants had a home. The minor appellants were able to go to school. The appellants do not allege that they were denied access to services in Brazil.\n[36] Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, I conclude, first of all, that the appellants have not demonstrated that they had good reasons for leaving Brazil and that, therefore, their departure from the country was involuntary in nature. In addition, in my view, the appellants failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or to demonstrate that they would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if they returned to Brazil.\n[37] This factor weighs in favour of exclusion.\nRisk in Angola\n[38] According to a recent Federal Court decision, Ahmad22, independently of the right to return to a third country, the risk to which a claimant is subjected in their country of citizenship must also be analyzed before concluding that exclusion clause 1E applies. Accordingly, I am of the view that the RPD should have analyzed the risk to which the appellants would be subjected in Angola.\n[39] That said, even if I were to conclude that the appellants would be subjected to a risk should they return to Angola, a factor weighing against exclusion, as mentioned above, I conclude that they have a right to return to Brazil, a country in which they have not established a serious possibility of persecution or demonstrated the existence of a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nConcluding that the Angolan appellants are persons referred to in Article 1E of the Convention does not breach Canada's international obligations\n[40] I conclude that Canada's international obligations would not be breached by the application of Article 1 E of the Convention.\n[41] In this case, because the Angolan appellants are family members, namely parents and sisters of a Brazilian child, they could return to Brazil by obtaining a family reunification visa. The appellants have not established a serious possibility of persecution in Brazil on any of the five Convention grounds. Furthermore, they have not demonstrated that they would be personally subjected to any of the risks listed in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA in the event of a return to Brazil.\n[42] Consequently, concluding that the appellants are persons referred to in Article 1E of the Convention does not breach Canada's international obligations.\n[43] Accordingly, after weighing the various factors set out in Zeng, I conclude that the RPD's final decision is correct. The Angolan appellants are persons referred to in Article 1E of the Convention.\nBrazilian appellant\n[44] I conclude that the RPD did not err in finding that the Brazilian female appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, the existence of a risk under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if she were to return to Brazil.\n[45] As mentioned above in the analysis of the risk to which the Angolan appellants would be subjected in Brazil, the evidence on the record does not make it possible to conclude that they would face a serious possibility of persecution on any of the five Convention grounds or a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA in the event of a return to Brazil. This analysis also applies to the situation of the minor appellant, whose refugee protection claim is based on that of her parents.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] I dismiss the appeal. I confirm the RPD's determination that XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are neither refugees nor persons in need of protection as they are excluded under Article 1E of the Convention.\n[47] As for XXXX XXXX XXXX, I confirm the RPD's determination that she is neither a \"Convention refugee\" under section 96 of the IRPA, nor a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nMarie-Lyne Thibault\nMarie-Lyne Thibault\nJanuary 30, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Ahmad v.

They are alleging that they fear for their lives at the hands of the family of a murder victim with ties to drug traffickers.\n[2] On June 13, 2022, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the refugee protection claim because the appellants would have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in M\u00e9rida.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. The appellants have a viable IFA in M\u00e9rida.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] In XXXX 2015, an altercation took place between some men in a bar that resulted in a man's death. During the murder, the principal appellant's father and uncle were at the bar. There was an investigation and a man was convicted, but the family of the deceased did not believe the person was guilty. They began threatening the principal appellant's father and uncle to reveal the identity of the true murderer. Fearing for their lives, they fled. Since then, the appellants and their families have been victims of threats from the family of the deceased. The principal appellant moved to Mexico City with his family but they were found. They then returned to live in XXXX XXXX XXXX in Oaxaca in 2019. Then, on XXXX XXXX, 2021, the appellants were followed by a van while they were in XXXX XXXX XXXX, but they were able to escape through an alley. Then, on XXXX XXXX, 2021, the appellants were physically assaulted in XXXX XXXX XXXX. Fearing for their lives, the appellants left Mexico for Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021.\nANALYSIS\n[5] My role is to assess all the evidence and determine if the RPD made the correct decision.1\nCredibility\nDate of the murder\n[6] In the decision, the RPD drew a negative inference from the fact that the principal appellant contradicted himself on the date of the murder. On appeal, the appellants submitted that the principal appellant had testified that the date given was approximate since he was not present during the event.2\n[7] I agree with the appellants. When the RPD questioned him about why he testified that the death took place on XXXX XXXX, 2015, whereas in his written account, it stated that the death took place on XXXX XXXX, 2015, the principal appellant responded that he gave an approximate date since he did not possess any documents. In my view, although he did not give an exact date, the principal appellant was still able to situate the event in time. Furthermore, in my view, the explanation that they were not present and that the events were reported to them is credible.3 As such, not having lived the event, it is plausible that they did not to remember the exact date.\n[8] As such, I am of the opinion that the RPD erred when it drew a negative inference from this contradiction.\nThe principal appellant's move to Mexico City\n[9] During the hearing, the RPD asked the principal appellant how it was possible that he left XXXX XXXX XXXX for Mexico City in 2016 when he wrote in his IMM 5669 form that he was studying in Mexico City from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2019. The principal appellant explained that he left XXXX XXXX XXXX around the end of 2015 or beginning of 2016.4 When questioned again, the principal appellant responded that he could not give an exact date for his move to Mexico City since he did not remember but that the dates in his form corresponded to the dates that appeared in his academic documents, that is 2015.5 The RPD did not accept this answer and drew a negative inference as to the principal appellant's credibility regarding his move to Mexico City due to the threats he and his family suffered. In his memorandum, the appellants allege that the RPD did not take his explanation into account.\n[10] I reviewed the information in the principal appellant's IMM 5669 form and it was indeed written that he was in XXXX XXXX in Mexico City from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2016.6 On appeal, the memorandum explains that the date he had written referred to the principal appellant's school registration and not the date he moved to Mexico City since he attended classes while the semester had already started. I am of the opinion that this explanation is plausible: the dates included in his IMM 5669 form indeed correlate with those of the school year. I also note that the principal appellant always referred to the year 2016 in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) as well as in his testimony.\n[11] Consequently, the RPD erred when it drew a negative inference from this contradiction.\nReturn to XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2019\n[12] During the hearing, the RPD confronted the principal appellant with the fact that he had written in his IMM 5669 form at question 12 that from XXXX 2017 to XXXX 2021, he lived in Mexico City, whereas, he testified that he left Mexico City in 2019 to move back to XXXX XXXX XXXX since the agents of harm had found him and the economic situation was not good.7 The principal appellant responded that the dates used were from a lease he had in Mexico City.8 On appeal, in his memorandum, the principal appellant argues that he relied on documents in his possession when filling out his immigration forms.\n[13] I do not accept this explanation. In the present case, the principal appellant did not explain why he relied on dates mentioned in a lease when he knew he had left in 2019, as per his testimony. Furthermore, contrary to the date discrepancy regarding his departure for Mexico City, which varied by a few months (previous section), this is a two-year difference. In fact, it is written in the IMM 5669 form that the principal appellant stayed in Mexico City until XXXX 2021, whereas he testified that he left in 2019. During the appeal, knowing that the RPD had drawn a negative inference, it was open to the appellant to provide a copy of said lease, on which he relied to fill out his form. This could have supported his claim, but he did not do so. Furthermore, the fact that the principal appellant was not credible regarding his claim that he left in 2019 and that he gave no substantial explanation for how he was found and what happened at that time, leads me to draw a negative inference from the allegation that he was found by his agents of harm in Mexico City.\n[14] Consequently, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err when it drew a negative inference regarding the principal appellant's credibility that he returned to XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2019, as he and his family were found in Mexico City.\nTime spent in Chiapas\n[15] In its decision, the RPD drew a negative inference from the fact that the appellants did not mention in their written account that they went back to XXXX XXXX XXXX from time to time while they lived in Chiapas. At the hearing, the principal appellant explained that with all the amendments they made, they forgot to write that they were coming and going between Chiapas and XXXX XXXX XXXX.9 In the memorandum, the appellants allege that this omission is neither significant nor determinative considering the severity of the situation they faced and their history over several years.\n[16] I do not agree with the appellants' allegations. In this case, I am of the opinion that this is a significant omission. In their BOC Form, it is mentioned that the appellants hid in Chiapas and that it was only a week before their departure when they returned to XXXX XXXX XXXX, in Oaxaca, to pick up their things.10 This allegation paints a very different picture from the one in which they mention going back to Oaxaca from time to time during the three months they stayed in Chiapas. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that this has an impact on the appellants' fears. The fact that they wrote that they stayed hidden shows that they had a fear. Whereas the fact that they went back from time to time, and without good reason, to the very city where their fear originated and where their agents of harm lived, directly impacts their credibility regarding the fear they claim to have of their agents of harm.\n[17] Consequently, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err when it drew a negative inference regarding their credibility.\nAttack on XXXX XXXX, 2021, in XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[18] At the hearing before the RPD, the appellants testified that they were followed by armed drug traffickers while they were in XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2021. When the RPD asked who was following them during the event, the principal appellant responded that it was family members of the deceased. He added that he could not see them since the truck windows were tinted, but that these people had already threatened to kill them or force them to work for them.11 When the RPD confronted the principal appellant about the fact that he could not see the people because of the windows, and thus could not identify them, the principal appellant responded that it was the same van he had seen before, that the people had weapons, and that aside from the police, the only other people who carry weapons are those affiliated with drug trafficking.12 Questioned again on how he could know it was them, the principal appellant answered that they had the same van as those who had previously threatened him. In its decision, the RPD concluded that the principal appellant was speculating on the attackers' identity. In the appeal memorandum, the appellants allege that it was reasonable that they thought of fleeing for their safety and that they were unable to identify people they did not know. They allege that they know the reality of their country.\n[19] I agree with the appellants. Although they mentioned that they did not see their attackers, they were able to identify the van that was identical to the one they had seen during the previous verbal threats. They thus made a plausible correlation, in my opinion. Furthermore, they stated that aside from the police, only traffickers and members of organized crime possess this type of van and are armed. The appellants know the reality of their country; they once again made a correlation to arrive at this conclusion. Consequently, I am of the opinion that the appellants relied on past events as well as their knowledge of Mexico to explain their response to the RPD and that they demonstrated that they were attacked by family members of the deceased or people related to them on XXXX XXXX, 2021.\n[20] The RPD thus erred.\nDocumentary evidence\n[21] In the memorandum, the appellants argue that the RPD erred by not granting any weight to the photographs of the appellants' wounds, whereas throughout the documentary evidence, the RPD had sufficient elements to corroborate the appellants' testimony regarding their fear.\n1) Complaint to the police\n[22] In the decision, the RPD did not give any weight to the appellants' complaints filed in the city of XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, regarding the attack on XXXX XXXX, 2021. The RPD found the principal appellant's explanation unreasonable that they waited before filing a complaint with the police because the threats were only verbal, whereas they had suffered relentless threats since 2015.\n[23] I am of the opinion that the RPD erred. In my view, in the circumstances, the RPD did not conclude appropriately. The RPD should have analyzed whether the fact that the appellants waited six years before filing a complaint with the police was behaviour that was inconsistent with that of a person fearing for their life. Nevertheless, I analyzed the complaints submitted by the appellants and they seem authentic at a first glance.13 Moreover, the complaints mainly repeat what the appellants mention in their BOC Form as well as their testimony. Furthermore, the complaints were handled by an official with the public ministry and signed. They are thus, in my view, authentic and credible. As such, I must afford them some weight.\n[24] Consequently, the RPD erred when it did not grant any weight to the complaints.\n2) Photograph\n[25] The appellants submitted as evidence a photograph of the appellant XXXX, who was allegedly hurt during the attack in XXXX 2021. Just like the RPD, I am of the opinion that the photograph does not establish that the wound is caused by the attack on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021. Since the photograph is not dated, I am unable to determine when it was taken. Nevertheless, I listened to the appellants' testimony concerning the attack they suffered and I did not find any contradictions, inconsistencies or omissions.14 Consequently, I am of the opinion that they are credible concerning the attack they suffered in XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2021.\n[26] The RPD erred when it drew a negative inference regarding the credibility of the allegation that the appellants were assaulted in XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2021.\n[27] In summary, after analyzing the entirety of the record, I am of the opinion that the appellants are credible when they state they were victims of assault in XXXX XXXX XXXX and that their agents of harm are family members of the deceased. However, I am of the opinion that the principal appellant did not establish that he was found when he fled to Mexico City. Finally, due to the inconsistency identified regarding their stay in Chiapas and the fact that the appellants were unable to provide credible explanations, I am of the opinion that they failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they took refuge in Chiapas for three months before leaving Mexico.\nInternal flight alternative\n[28] The IFA determination is based on a two-pronged test.15 Firstly, it must be established whether there is a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA. Secondly, it must be established whether it is reasonable for the claimant to settle in the proposed IFA, given their profile. The IFA is only viable if both prongs of the test are satisfied.16 Moreover, when the question of the existence of an IFA is raised, the onus is on the claimant to establish that this IFA is not viable.17\n[29] The first prong must be analyzed with respect to the agent of harm, notably their motivation to pursue as well as their ability to find the refugee protection claimant in the proposed IFA region. For the second prong, the claimant's personal circumstances and the circumstances of the people who live in the IFA area must be considered.\na. First prong: prospective assessment of the risk for the appellants in the internal flight alternative\nMotivation to find the appellants\n[30] The RPD concluded that the appellants did not establish that the family of the deceased would have the motivation to find them in the proposed IFA upon a return to Mexico. On appeal, the appellants argue that in the National Documentation Package (NDP), there is a section dealing with the motivation of organized criminal groups to find people and retaliate against them and that M\u00e9rida is the municipality in Yucat\u00e1n state with the most homicides. In the present case, other than their fear of the deceased's family having affiliations with drug traffickers, the appellants did not express other fears.18\n[31] At the RPD hearing, the RPD asked the appellants whether they could live in M\u00e9rida. The principal appellant responded no, since he had sought refuge in Mexico City and been found there. He added that if he went back to rent a house and obtain services, he would have to present his documents, and since these people were drug traffickers, they were connected to the government.19 When asked by the RPD why the family of the deceased would still want to find him when the event took place in 2015, the principal appellant responded that his father was not found and that it is a known fact that these people would not relent until they are dead.20\n[32] I do not accept the principal appellant's explanations. The record indicates that the threats began in 2015 in XXXX XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, the appellants were physically harassed in 2021 when they were in XXXX XXXX XXXX. As such, the appellants' testimony and record reveal that the agents of harm retaliated against them only in XXXX XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, the appellants still communicate with their families, who continue to live in XXXX XXXX XXXX, and although the appellants testified that their families still receive threats, the appellants did not testify that the agents of harm had gone to their families to find out where they were.21 Moreover, the documentary evidence mentions that \" criminal groups abduct and 'torture' relatives in order to find information about the targeted individual's whereabouts.\"22 In addition, although the documentary evidence mentions that certain criminal groups have the motivation to find people, it seems that this can vary if the motivation is very strong and if the group is among the most powerful in Mexico. Moreover, in the present case, the appellants were not able to state to which group the family allegedly had ties,23 and the principal appellant's police report shows that the family members of the deceased now work for drug traffickers who are really active in the region.24 As such, there was no evidence on the record that these people had connections other than in the region of XXXX. Moreover, the appellants alleged that the increased presence of members of the Los Zetas cartel, which has the ability and motivation to find people who move elsewhere in Mexico, should not be neglected. As previously mentioned, the appellants were not able to state with which group the family of the deceased were affiliated. This allegation thus has no foundation. Furthermore, it is mentioned in the documentary evidence that the group will not track just anyone: it really depends on who you are and what you did.25 Finally, I have already found in previous paragraphs that the principal appellant is not credible concerning the allegation that he was located in Mexico City.\n[33] Consequently, the appellants did not demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that their agents of harm would have the motivation to find them outside of XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[34] The RPD did not err when it concluded that the agents of harm did not have the motivation.\nAbility to find the appellants\n[35] Given that the appellants did not demonstrate that the agents of harm had the motivation to find them in M\u00e9rida, I need not to analyze the ability of the agents of harm.\nb. Second prong: reasonableness of the IFA\n[36] In the second prong, the question is whether it is reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for the appellants to move to the city of M\u00e9rida.\n[37] On appeal, the appellants submit that the RPD did not consider the documentary evidence on the record and in the NDP since it was mentioned that M\u00e9rida is the municipality in Yucat\u00e1n state with the most homicides. Furthermore, it states that criminal groups' determination to find and retaliate against a person, as well as their ability and motivation, is such that it would be erroneous to find that M\u00e9rida is a reasonable IFA for them.\n[38] On appeal, the appellants presented arguments that are related to the first prong, namely the prospective assessment of risk for the appellants in the IFA. As such, their arguments do not demonstrate that it would be objectively unreasonable for the appellants to seek refuge in the proposed IFA. Furthermore, I analyzed the RPD's reasoning on this matter and I did not find any errors.\n[39] Consequently, the RPD's finding regarding the second prong is correct.\n[40] The IFA is reasonable.\n[41] Given all of the above, I conclude that the appellants have failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution on one of the five Convention grounds or to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that upon returning to Mexico, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to their life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] I confirm the determination of the RPD that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[43] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nMurielle Henri\nJanuary 3, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX XXXX, the appellant, is a citizen of Colombia.\n[2] The appellant fears persecution from soldiers responsible for extrajudicial executions because she denounced them on a XXXX.\n[3] The appellant allegedly created a XXXX with her friend XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017, on which they denounced extrajudicial executions carried out by soldiers, known as \"false positives,\" a military strategy that involves murdering innocent civilians in order to pass their bodies off as guerillas killed in combat.\n[4] In XXXX 2017, the XXXX was hacked, and the appellant received an anonymous call threatening her with death if the XXXX was continued.\n[5] The appellant was on her way to meet the mother of a victim of said abuses in XXXX 2017, when the police stopped her and checked her identity. She subsequently received a second call threatening death and telling her that the caller knew where she lived. She therefore filed a complaint. After that, the appellant received an anonymous letter indicating that they knew where to find her.\n[6] In XXXX 2018, the appellant moved to Valledupar in C\u00e9sar on XXXX XXXX, 2018. In XXXX 2018, men who appeared to be soldiers went to the home of her friend, who then informed the appellant. She therefore moved again in XXXX 2018, settling in Barranquilla.\n[7] The appellant left Colombia on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and signed her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) on June 18, 2018.\n[8] Since her departure from Colombia, her parents inform her that they have received several threatening telephone calls, and that two individuals came to their home looking for the appellant in XXXX 2020 and XXXX 2021. They have since moved to the department of C\u00e9sar.\n[9] On June 27, 2022, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected her claim on the grounds that she was not credible.\n[10] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is credibility.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD correctly determined that the appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[12] My role is to examine all the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.1\nCredibility\nInconsistencies regarding the motivations of the agent of persecution\n[13] On appeal, the appellant argues that the RPD's determination on the issue of credibility is wrong. She submits that the RPD erred in finding that there were inconsistencies regarding the motivations of the agent of persecution. She states that the RPD misinterpreted her fear because she is not targeted solely because of the meetings with the victims' mothers and the information obtained that was going to be published, but rather because of her activities, all of her activities (social, political, humanitarian).\n[14] I do not agree with the appellant's argument.\n[15] The RPD member noted significant gaps in the evidence and concluded that she did not establish that the soldiers responsible for the extrajudicial executions had connected her to the contentious XXXX, nor did she establish, on the same burden of proof, that they were aware of her meetings with the victims' mothers and that they fear that she will publish important information incriminating them. In addition, the RPD concluded that the appellant did not establish that she is threatened and being sought by soldiers because of her imputed political opinion or her membership in the particular social group of political leaders. I tend to agree, as the available evidence does not support a conclusion that there is an objective basis for her alleged fear of persecution or harm at the hands of groups of military authorities.\n[16] The RPD characterized the issues as follows: credibility, subjective fear, state protection and internal flight alternative. At the beginning of the hearing, the RPD asked the appellant whom she feared, she responded the military authorities in Colombia. To the question of whether she feared anyone in particular, she testified no, that she feared the authorities in Colombia. The RPD therefore asked what she knew about this group, she responded that they are large powerful groups.2 To the question of what she feared they would do to her, she responded, kill her.3 The RPD therefore asked why this group would want to kill her and she explained that it was because they believe she has important information about extrajudicial killings.4 She also stated that she received direct threats because she had information about \"false positives\" obtained through conversations with 10 to 20 families between XXXX 2017 and XXXX 2017 during public marches and protests against these military abuses. She did not know how many demonstrations she had participated in, stating that it was about 10 marches.5\n[17] I am therefore of the view that at the beginning of the RPD hearing, the member set out the background information and the chronology of the events underpinning the refugee protection claim. There is nothing to suggest that the RPD misinterpreted the appellant's fear or that it incorrectly assessed the risks that the appellant would face if she returned to Colombia. I am of the opinion that the issues in the personal profile were appropriately defined.\n[18] I note that the appellant testified that she was threatened and being sought by the authorities in her country, because they believe that she has information about the extrajudicial killings that occurred in Colombia, since she spoke to the victims' mothers. I see that she testified that she received direct threats because she had information about \"false positives,\" obtained through conversations with 10 to 20 families between XXXX 2017 and XXXX 2018 during public marches and protests against these military abuses, but she did not know how many demonstrations she had participated in, she stated that it was about 10 marches.6 The appellant also stated that she could not put the said testimony in writing because they had been threatened by the military. She testified that she stopped all activity on the XXXX in XXXX 2017.\n[19] The RPD asked the appellant why she does not mention in her BOC Form and amended BOC Form that she had met with 10 to 20 women and written articles about them.7 The appellant responded that she first of all recounted what had happened in Colombia. Her counsel intervened to indicate that she describes this in paragraphs 14 and 15 of her BOC Form.8 Like the RPD, I conducted a thorough analysis of the appellant's BOC Form, and like the RPD, I am of the opinion that the BOC Form does not address the allegation that the appellant met 10 to 20 women and wrote these articles about them.\n[20] When the BOC Form is compared with her testimony, it is clear that several details regarding her meeting with 10 to 20 women have been omitted and that the description of this event is inconsistent with the sparse information in her BOC Form. I do not consider these explanations to be satisfactory, because question 2(a) specifically states that it is necessary to explain in detail what happened, when, where and why. In addition, I note that the appellant submitted an amended BOC Form. On a balance of probabilities, I am of the opinion that the appellant had a good understanding of question 2(a) since they did so for the other events. Given that the appellant testified that the soldiers wanted the information she had about these women and their families, the meetings with these women constitute an important element that is central to her refugee protection claim. I would therefore have expected her to provide certain details in her BOC Form, which undermines her credibility as to whether she met these women, wrote articles about them and is being sought by soldiers in connection with this information. The RPD's conclusion drawing a negative credibility inference is entirely correct.\n[21] The RPD asked the appellant why the soldiers targeted them when she had not published the information collected from the victims' mothers on their XXXX and the fact that their XXXX was anonymous. The appellant explained that she thought it was because they feared that she would publish the information on the XXXX. The RPD therefore wanted to understand how the authorities knew of the meetings with the 10 to 20 mothers of victims. The appellant responded on the one hand that she did not know, that in Colombia things work like this, that they are looking for information about social leaders and that she was associated with these mothers.9 She then added that during a planned meeting with one of the victims' mothers in a travel terminal, she and her friend XXXX were stopped by the police, who checked their identities. I note that the RPD had to repeat the question almost four times, as the appellant seemed to deflect it, providing only very general answers. I would point out that the appellant never met the mother in question and that the police never saw them with a victim's mother. I am of the opinion that the appellant's explanations are insufficient, as they do not establish how the soldiers could have known that they had met with victims' mothers and that they had a XXXX on which they were going to publish articles incriminating them.\n[22] Furthermore, since the appellant testified that she collected information after speaking to 10 to 20 mothers and wrote articles about what happened to the victims, the RPD confronted the appellant to understand why these articles did not include information about the 10 to 20 mothers of victims with whom the appellant and her friend XXXX met. The RPD also informed the appellant that the articles referred more to facts found in the national press and to studies conducted by organizations such as Human Rights Watch. The appellant responded that they used public information and photographs available on the Internet and that she refers to the [translation] \"mothers of Soacha\" in one of the articles. However, like the RPD, I note that this reference is very general and that there are no details or information about these mothers. At the hearing, the appellant did not provide any specific additional information about these meetings. In addition, when asked by her counsel what [translation] \"important information\" the soldiers wanted to obtain, the appellant stated that they were part of a large organization and wanted the names of the victims, as well as the names of those responsible for these murders and the location of the corpses. When comparing her testimony with the published information, like the RPD, I do not see any of this information in the published articles. Confronted with the fact that this information is not found in the articles, she responded that she first researched all the information and then recounted what had happened in Colombia.10 Like the RPD, I am of the opinion that these explanations are not satisfactory because she did not establish how the soldiers could have known that she had met with victims' mothers and that she had a XXXX on which she was going to publish their testimony, particularly since this occurred after the alleged hacking. It is my opinion, on a balance of probabilities, that the associated targeting by military authorities is in fact speculative.\n[23] With respect to the allegation that the appellant fled her country because she had been threatened and then located in the two cities (Valledupar and Barranquilla) where she had gone to hide, the RPD asked why this is not mentioned in her BOC Form. The appellant merely explained that XXXX had been located in the two cities (Gir\u00f3n and Puerto Libertador) where he had gone to hide. The panel pointed out, however, that she did not answer its question, because she referred to XXXX's story rather than her own. The appellant subsequently indicated that she was not located by her agents of persecution in either of the two cities. However, she reiterated that she was informed that she had been sought in Valledupar on XXXX XXXX, 2018, after her departure for Barranquilla. I am of the opinion that on a balance of probabilities, the appellant did not establish that she was located by her agents of persecution in Valledupar and Barranquilla, which undermines her credibility, as this was a catalyst for her decision to leave Colombia to save her life. This undermines her credibility with respect to her alleged fear.\n[24] Like the RPD, I have considered the documentary evidence that shows that Colombian state security forces are responsible for numerous arbitrary killings and the torture of human rights defenders. It notes that political activists are often victims of abuse by armed groups and police authorities.11\n[25] However, as the RPD correctly noted, given that the appellant did not establish that she was persecuted because of her political activities or her imputed political opinion, the documentary evidence does not apply.\n[26] At the beginning of the hearing, as was appropriate, the principal appellant was questioned about the truthfulness of the contents of her BOC Form, and she stated that the contents were correct. As already discussed in my reasons, the RPD noted contradictions and omissions between her testimony and the BOC Form that were not satisfactorily explained. The RPD gave the principal appellant several opportunities to provide necessary clarification, which she did not do. I am therefore of the opinion that the RPD's negative inference regarding the contradictions between her testimony and her BOC Form was correct, which undermines her credibility.\nProfile as a woman in Colombia\n[27] The RPD analyzed the appellant's prospective risk as a woman and concluded that the evidence did not support a conclusion of a serious possibility of persecution should she return to Colombia. In her memorandum, the appellant does not challenge the RPD's conclusion in this regard. After assessing all the documentary evidence, taking into account the appellant's personal and family situation as well as Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution12 issued by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, I am of the opinion that the appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution because of her gender should she return to Colombia. I note that the appellant is an ingenious person with a good academic record in XXXX XXXX, and a variety of professional experience in both Colombia and Canada. I would point out that the appellant still has family in several Colombian cities with whom she is in contact. In addition, the appellant did not raise any reason that she would be unable to obtain assistance from these same people. Given her educational background, her work experience and her support network. I note that the appellant did not mention a fear related to her profile as a woman, so the appellant's personal situation does not correspond to that of a woman who would be at risk in Colombia.\n[28] I reviewed all the evidence on the record and listened to the audio recording of the hearing. I note that at the hearing, the appellant was questioned at length by the RPD about her activities in connection with extrajudicial executions, women, the articles and her XXXX. What emerged, according to the RPD, is seemingly vague explanations as to how the soldiers were able to find the information and why the principal appellant was not arrested following her public concerts, as well as the fact that they were not prohibited by the government in place.1 It is my opinion that on a balance of probabilities, it is unlikely that the appellant acquired a political profile in Colombia that would result in a serious possibility that she would be persecuted by the authorities if she were to return now, four years after leaving that country.\n[29] I note that the RPD asked several questions throughout the hearing, and that counsel intervened when he considered it necessary to provide clarification. Consequently, I consider it incumbent on the appellant and her counsel to provide supporting evidence to substantiate the allegations that her life is still in danger five years after the XXXX ended in XXXX 2017. For these reasons, the RPD's negative inference as to the appellant's credibility was correct. There is no evidence on the record that allows me to conclude that the RPD acted lightly or ignored evidence entered in the record.\n[30] For these reasons, after reviewing all the evidence, considering the appeal memorandum and conducting an independent assessment of the record, I have come to the conclusion that the appellant failed to establish that there is a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Colombia.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the determination of the RPD that the appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPascale Aubin\nJanuary 12, 2023\nIRB translation\nO\nDate\nOriginal language: French\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They fear returning to that country because the PA worked on behalf of Aam Admi Party (AAP) during elections in 2016 and 2017. He and his family have been harassed and threatened by members of a rival political party; the Indian National Congress party (INC) and the INC is using their affiliation with police to harass him. They fear they will be persecuted on return.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellants' claims finding that they can relocate safely to either Mumbai, or New Delhi and that it is not unreasonable to require them to move there. In other words, they were found to have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in those cities.\n[3] The Appellants have appealed to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), arguing that the RPD made errors in its IFA analysis.\nDECISION\n[4] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[5] The PA became an active worker for the AAP in XXXX 2014. He was well known due to his engagement in rallies, for putting up posters and boards in support of the party, and because he accompanied the Sarpanch on door-to-door visits to ask for votes for his party and arranged visits with local leaders. Other political parties disliked his activities, and the INC told him to stop his work and join their party, but the PA refused.\n[6] In XXXX 2016, after the PA participated in a big rally organized by the AAP's local leader, INC goons arrived and physically assaulted him. Police were called. The goons escaped and the PA was taken to the station where he explained that the INC was responsible. Police refused to take his complaint and threatened him instead saying he should keep away from the INC. He was beaten and kept overnight. He was released after the Sarpanch and people from his area paid a bribe.\n[7] He was reassured by his area party leader that these problems would be resolved once they won the election and resumed his work on behalf of the party after he recovered from the assault. However, police began to harass him. They searched his home after he held a strategy meeting with area leaders related to the upcoming elections.\n[8] The INC won the XXXX 2017 elections and the Akali Dal Badal candidate won in his constituency, but the INC leader was angry, and he and his goons planned to take revenge because the PA caused them to lose votes. INC goons beat the PA with iron rods and baseball bats on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The police refused to take his father's complaint about the incident and told him that the PA should stay away from the INC, or he would be killed. Thereafter police continued to harass him and his attempt to get assistance from the Senior Superintendent of Police was unsuccessful.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, police raided the PA's home when he was not there. They took his wife to the police station and questioned her about the PA's whereabouts. They tortured and raped her. She was released the following day after the Sarpanch and influential people intervened. She was ordered not to disclose the rape and to present her husband. A bribe was paid, and her fingerprints and signatures were taken on blank papers.\n[10] The AA therefore joined the PA in XXXX, Haryana where he was staying with a relative and they sought the assistance of an agent who helped arrange their travel to Canada. They arrived on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and made their refugee claim at the airport.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[11] The Appellants ask that the following items be allowed as new evidence in their appeal:\na. An article titled \"A Comprehensive Discussion of the Internal Flight Option for Punjabi Sikh Survivors of Political Rape and other Forms of Institutionalized Violence;\"1\nb. An article titled \"No Safe Haven: The Myth of the Internal Flight Alternative in India for Returned Sikh Asylum Seekers;\"2 and\nc. Decision No. XXXX XXXX XXXX of the United Nations Committee against Torture.3\nThe evidence presented by the Appellants is rejected\n[12] According to the Law,4 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[13] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.5\n[14] Item 'c' is caselaw, therefore it need not be counted as new evidence, and I have considered the case in coming to my decision.\n[15] Items 'a' and 'b' are not admissible. They were written in XXXX 2004 and XXXX 2004; thus, they predate the RPD's decision. No explanation was provided on appeal about why these documents were not presented before the rejection of the claim. The Appellants were represented by Counsel at the RPD hearing, and IFA was raised as an issue, such that it would have been known that they had to address their risk in those areas. It is expected that claimants provide all relevant evidence and arguments in relation to their claim. As such, the articles are not being accepted as they do not meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\nRequest for an oral hearing is rejected\n[16] I am unable to convene an oral hearing as there is no admissible new evidence in this case.6\nANALYSIS\n[17] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.7\n[18] The Appellants argue that the RPD made errors in assessing the IFA:\n* As it did not apply the Gender Guidelines appropriately;\n* By finding that the agents of persecution did not have the means or motivation to locate them;\n* By finding that the IFA locations are reasonable.\n[19] The determinative issue on appeal is also IFA and I have considered the Chairperson Guideline 4: Gender Consideration in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board (Gender Guidelines)8 when coming to my decision given the nature of the allegations present.\n[20] I also note that on appeal the Appellants have quoted from the National Documentation Package (NDP) used at the RPD hearing, despite the fact that when they submitted their appeal a newer version of the NDP published on June 30, 2022, was available. In this decision, I refer to the same NDP used by the Appellants, but I have also looked at and considered the latest version and I find that the information therein has not changed substantially as it relates to matters discussed in this claim.\nThe Law on IFA\n[21] The test for assessing an IFA is as follows:\n(1) I must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the Appellants being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the Appellants would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the Appellants to seek refuge there.9\n[22] Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have an IFA.\n[23] For the reasons that follow, I agree with the RPD that the Appellants have an IFA in Mumbai or New Delhi.\nThe Appellants are not at risk in Mumbai or New Delhi\nThe agents of persecution are not motivated to pursue the Appellants elsewhere\n[24] I agree with the RPD that the agents of persecution have shown a lack of motivation to find them.\n[25] While they argue that the motivation is clear because the PA's father and his family were harassed and his father died at the hands of the INC goons' years after his departure, I agree with the RPD that the timing of this evidence regarding threats and harassment to his family is questionable. It was presented on the day of the hearing, some four and a half years after their Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative was written, when this harassment is alleged to have been ongoing since their departure. However, even if I accept that INC goons were responsible for his father's death and that police have questioned his relative in Haryana, I do not find that this establishes that they are motivated to locate the Appellants countrywide.\n[26] The primary agent of persecution here is the local INC party. They did not like the PA working on behalf of their competitor during the elections and used their influence to coopt police in their area to harass the PA as punishment and to prevent him from further interfering.\n[27] Their local police have targeted the Appellants extrajudicially. The PA's detention came about as he tried to make a complaint against the INC. Police detained him instead and he was explicitly warned by them to stop working against the INC, thus showing that they were acting on behalf of that party.\n[28] Additionally, I have considered the absence of formal proceedings against the Appellants (arrest protocols were not followed,10 no First Information Report (FIR) was issued, and no charges were laid). Police accepted bribes to facilitate their release, they sexually assaulted the AA (an illegal act), and they took her signature on blank pages rather than formal police documents. I find that these actions are indicative of the fact that theirs were illegal detentions and that police actions were initiated due to a political rivalry and vengeance, rather than because of legitimate police concerns.\n[29] The onus is on the Appellants to show that there is no IFA and the evidence in this case does not establish that police are motivated to locate them in the IFA locations. After the Appellants' departure, police harassed the PA's father (now deceased), and they questioned the PA's relative in Haryana in the same month that they left India. This is the person that the Appellants stayed with temporarily before their departure. Police continue to visit that relative.11 There is no information before me about the frequency of these visits or about how they found out about this relative, nor there is evidence of any escalation of their efforts. They keep asking about the PA at the last places he resided but have done nothing further that is demonstrative of the desire to find the Appellants in the IFA.\n[30] I find that it is significant that police have not approached the closest relatives of either Appellants, including the PA's brother, who lives in their village and tends to the Appellants' farm, nor his sister who lives in a different village,12 nor the AA's parents.13\n[31] Furthermore, although police verbally accused the PA of having ties to antinational activities; an additional allegation made since their departure, I find that police have not advanced or escalated their efforts to find or apprehend the Appellants. Thus, this does not suggest that police genuinely view the PA as being a threat to national security such that additional time and resources would be devoted to pursuing the Appellants elsewhere.\n[32] Police in India are notoriously underfunded and understaffed.14 The police continue to seek the Appellants periodically, but only at obvious, known locations (their home\/their neighbours, with the Sarpanch and in their last hiding place). However, no FIR has been filed against them before or since their departure, police have not laid any charges, or issued a summons or warrants for their arrest despite their failure to come forward and there is no evidence that any other police agency or entities that deal specifically with terrorism and militants15 have been involved in his case. These are the logical next steps that would trigger alerts with their counterparts elsewhere in other states and signal that the Appellants are seen as threats to the nation.\n[33] I find that the PA's political profile is also a relevant consideration. The Appellants suggest that the PA's role should not be minimized. I accept that he was active for the AAP party in his locale, and he was viewed as important in the area because he was swaying voters against the INC. He was a worker for the party, rather than a member or political candidate. He has not been directly involved in politics for over four years; he has not canvassed for his party or done anything further to interfere with INC votes. Additionally, as their Counsel pointed out in submissions, the PA's political party, the AAP won the most recent elections in Punjab,16 which means that the cooperation extended to the INC party against their political opponents may be diminished as country documents allude to the fact that police tend to align themselves with the party in power as they submit to political pressure.17\n[34] From their encounters with police and INC in and around XXXX village, in Jalandhar, Punjab state, I conclude that these groups have an interest in them locally and that they continue to ask about the Appellants at their last place of residence with the PA's relative in a neighbouring state. However, this does not mean that they or police elsewhere are motivated to locate and persecute the Appellants throughout India.\n[35] This is determinative of the first prong. Nonetheless, I have proceeded to analyze the capacity of the agents of persecution to locate the Appellants in Mumbai or Delhi.\nThe agents of persecution do not have the means to locate the Appellants in the IFA\nGender Guidelines\n[36] The Appellants argue that the RPD made an error by not applying the Gender Guidelines18 to the personal situation of the AA. They argue that the AA's testimony on the issue was barely addressed in the RPD's analysis and aside from stating that the Gender Guidelines were considered, the decision does not show how the guidelines were considered and applied.\n[37] The Appellants were found to be credible with respect to their allegations about what happened to them in XXXX village, Punjab with INC goons and the police prior to their departure. There is no evidence that the RPD disregarded the AA's testimony or did not lead the proceeding with the appropriate sensitivity. The Gender Guidelines are intended to assist members in conducting fair hearings and rendering well-reasoned decisions but do not change the criteria to be accepted as a refugee. Thus, while they were found to have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home area, they still have to establish that they would be at risk in the IFA and that the IFA was unreasonable, which I agree they failed to do.\n[38] They argue that the RPD's assessment at paragraphs 49 to 51 was wrong as there is no valid reason for AA being raped and having her signature and fingerprints on blank pages allow police to put her in any police system or write a report that can be shared with police entities in other regions, thus allowing them to track her down. However, I find first, that they misapprehended the RPD's findings. They suggest that the RPD found that the officers committed the rape in order to protect themselves. However, the RPD summarized the AA's testimony in paragraph 49 - that the AA stated at the hearing that the police officers had warned her that if she spoke about her sexual assault, they would be able to complete the blank form, adding false charges against her. The RPD then stated:19\nThe female claimant was sexually abused by corrupt police officers, and they did this to\nprotect themselves from prosecution, not necessarily for the established purpose of tracking them down. In this regard, the police officers clearly explained to the female claimant why they had taken these precautions, therefore no weight is given to this argument.\n[39] When the RPD states, they did 'this' to protect themselves, the Member was not referring to the rape itself, but rather to the act of taking fingerprints and signatures, which was done to protect themselves from any repercussions\/ to intimidate her so she would not expose their illegal act. The RPD did not use flawed logic as suggested as the conclusion drawn about police intentions was based on the AA's testimony and their warning and the laying of false charges would result from her speaking out about their conduct\/the sexual assault.\n[40] Secondly, while the taking of fingerprints and signatures could certainly result in the ability to track a person down, this is only the case if something is done with those items. For example, if they subsequently created a report against her\/charged her with an offence. There is no evidence that they have done this; laid charges or written a FIR.\n[41] I am not persuaded by the Appellants' arguments that since the AA fled and as the police kept harassing the PA's father, that it is more probable than improbable that they registered false charges against the Appellants as there is no basis for this assumption and it is speculative. Moreover, the AA has not spoken out about the sexual assault as they instructed.\n[42] The arguments related to the AA's psychological state will be dealt with in the reasonableness prong below.\nIt is unlikely the Appellants will be found based on tenant verification\n[43] As previously described, the Appellants' detentions were illegal. The objective country documents indicate that such arrests are not officially recorded or documented in the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS),20 which is the only nationwide police database and is used to facilitate the tenant verification process.\n[44] I agree with and adopt the RPD's findings related to tenant verification for the same reasons and see no reason to reiterate them here.21 Again, although the country documentation package on India has been updated since the hearing, I have reviewed the new NDP and the evidence in regard to this process remains the same. The Appellants are unlikely to be in the CCTNS given they have no criminal history, and they were illegally detained. Thus, any check of the system by police in the IFA locations is unlikely to reveal adverse information and there is not a serious possibility that they will be located in this way by police from their local station in Punjab state or by INC members from their region.\nOther arguments\n[45] They suggest that there is no IFA where the state is the agent of persecution. However, an IFA can exist if the risk of persecution stems from an authority of the State whose power is clearly limited to a specific geographical area.22 This is the case here as the agent of persecution is the police station from the Appellants' home area in Punjab state. Each state has its own separate police force and while I acknowledge the evidence about cooperation that does exist between states at times and that manual work can be done to track down wanted individuals, the documents specify that cooperation normally happens where persons are wanted for serious, heinous, and high-profile crimes.23 As previously indicated, there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellants are wanted for such crimes.\n[46] They argue that an IFA is not viable if a person must remain in hiding. However, as I have found that they are not at risk in the IFA locations, it follows that they would not have to be in hiding.\n[47] They may be questioned upon return about their absence as suggested since this is standard procedure. However, given that they left India on valid passports24 (the PA's and AA's still being valid until XXXX XXXX, 2025) and as they have no criminal history or any known FIR and they have not established that they are in any police database as described above, any verifications of their identity that are done related to re-entry process25 or for any other purpose such as getting an apartment, job or cellphone are unlikely to cause concerns or issues.\n[48] I acknowledge that India has sophisticated computer systems and that country documents state that \"the police can determine the location of a person by asking the [TSP] (telecom service providers) to triangulate the location of the mobile phone using cell phone towers or by securing details of the [IP] of an email account.\"26 However, in order to monitor or locate the Appellants in this way, besides having to be aware that they returned to India and to Mumbai or New Delhi, I find that the police would also first need to know who their internet service provider is on return and have their email address as well as their mobile phone numbers at their disposal.\n[49] Ultimately, there is no evidence that the local police from Punjab state or the INC supporters in their village of XXXX, in Punjab state would know that the Appellants had returned to India. There is also no evidence that these persons are or would be looking for the Appellants in Mumbai or New Delhi at present or would have the means and\/or the ability to locate them amongst the 20.961 and 32.066 million27 people residing in those cities. Furthermore, I note that the INC is not the ruling party in either of the IFA locations.28 The PA's political party, the AAP is, in fact the ruling party of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, a factor in favour of the Appellants having support there.\n[50] I find that the Appellants have not discharged their burden to show that they would face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Mumbai or New Delhi or that they would be personally subject to a risk to their lives or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, or of torture in those cities. Thus, the first prong of the IFA test is not satisfied.\nIt is not unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate\n[51] The RPD found that the IFAs were reasonable. I agree.\n[52] The Appellants argue that the rape created harsh psychological consequences for the AA that were not considered and that there is no valid IFA in this instance because she cannot get any proper protection from the police, when it was the police that raped her. Thus, it is unreasonable to find there is a safe haven in another part of India.\n[53] I have considered whether by reason of her gender the AA will face undue hardship in travelling or staying in the proposed IFA.29\n[54] With respect to the latter, she was the victim of a heinous gender-based crime, but it was at the hands of corrupt police officers from her area. IFA is determinative of the appeal and the AA was found to have a viable or safe IFA as those officers do not have the means or motivation to find her there. It follows that there would be no need to seek protection in the new areas unless a new issue arises.\n[55] This is a forward-looking analysis and I have considered what the Gender Guidelines state with reference to state protection. On the issue of whether the AA could reasonably be expected to access any state protection in future, there is no evidence that she could not. While she may be reluctant to approach authorities for future unspecified matters, given her traumatic experience with corrupt officer from her local police station, she is relocating with her husband who can help her in obtaining assistance as and when required. She is not a single woman who would be living alone, which is the profile which documents specify would be at risk of sexual assault in India.\n[56] I agree with the Appellants that the AA's psychological condition as a result of the rape was not explicitly mentioned when looking at the reasonableness prong. As such, I have considered this as part of my independent assessment, and I find that it does not render the IFA unreasonable. The medical reports before me relate to the AA's treatment in Canada for a condition related to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. They do not speak to her mental health, but I accept that she experienced trauma due to the sexual assault that should be considered in this analysis. However, the IFA is not rendered unreasonable for the AA in the particular circumstances here.\n[57] The threshold for unreasonableness is very high and requires proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant.30 The Appellants have not established that this would be the case here. Although they submit that the AA has no studies and question how she will find work as a survivor of rape who is not educated, she is not uneducated as suggested. The AA has a XXXX XXXX,31 having studied for XXXX years at XXXX. She did not work in India prior to these events as she was a housewife.32 After the precipitating incidents, she subsequently travelled to and found work in Canada (a place unknown to her) at a XXXX XXXX33 and worked until her medical condition prevented her from continuing on due to an inability to stand for lengthy periods.34 Her testimony alludes to the fact that she is unable to work because of her medical condition no matter where she resides.\n[58] I agree with and adopt the RPD's analysis related to her other health issues for the same reasons.35 I also accept that the AA has experienced trauma related to the sexual assault, and that relocation may be difficult, but I find that these difficulties do not rise to a level which would jeopardize her life and safety. I note also that although limited, there are mental health care facilities and services available in both states where the IFAs are located.36\n[59] The RAD case37 that is quoted is distinguishable on the facts. Unlike the Appellant in that case, who was not believed because of a microscopic examination of evidence, misapprehending the evidence, and using certain factors to doubt credibility that were unwarranted, the Appellants here were found to be credible in relation to their allegations. The RPD simply found that they can reside elsewhere, and I agree.\n[60] I have reviewed the other findings in relation to the second prong38 and I agree with those findings as well.\n[61] Having considered the conditions in Mumbai and New Delhi and all of the circumstances of this case, including those particular to the Appellants, I find that it is not objectively unreasonable for them to seek refuge by relocating and residing in the IFA locations.\nCONCLUSION\n[62] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nT.

He is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his refugee protection claim because he failed to rebut the presumption of state protection.\nSummary of the relevant facts\n[2] The appellant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019. He alleges that he fears the family of his former girlfriend with whom he had intimate relations between XXXX 2018 and XXXX 2019. Her family discovered the relationship between the two, and the girlfriend's brother allegedly initiated a plan to avenge honour by going after the appellant. In late XXXX 2019, his girlfriend's brother physically assaulted the appellant and tried to slit his throat with a knife. The appellant managed to run away. The agent of risk then traced his telephone number and called him and uttered threats. The appellant sought refuge at his grandmother's home in downtown XXXX. Shortly before his departure, he had a chance encounter with his agent of risk, who allegedly beat him and left him unconscious. That was when he decided to leave for Canada.\nThe Refugee Protection Division's position\n[3] The RPD concluded that the appellant's testimony was generally credible concerning the events experienced in Algeria. It concluded that the appellant failed to establish the state's inability to ensure his protection. The fact that he failed to report his fears to the police authorities and the explanations provided to justify this failure are not reasonable. The explanations are contradicted by the objective documentary evidence. The appellant did not take measures to give the state a real possibility of protecting him.\nThe appellant's position\n[4] The appellant criticizes the RPD for failing to consider the objective evidence demonstrating the lax approach the police take to private matters, for failing to consider the evidence indicating that relationships outside of marriage are the primary motive for honour crimes and that, while honour crimes are rare, they do exist. He argues that the police are effective when it comes to organized crime but not honour crimes. He adds that Islam forbids relations outside marriage. Lastly, he criticizes the RPD for failing to provide clear reasons regarding the risk he faces and for failing to consider news articles showing that honour crimes are frequent in Algeria. He criticizes the RPD for dismissing his testimony regarding his agent of risk and his criminal activities, and the possible connection to the police, without providing any details.\nDeterminative issue\n[5] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division is state protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD's decision is correct. The appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. I conducted my own analysis of the record. The exclusion under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(i)1 clearly indicates that, for a person to be declared a person in need of protection, it must be demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that they are justified in not seeking state protection, or that they are unable to do so because the agent of risk is a state actor. The reasons the appellant gave for failing to avail himself of state protection are speculative. There is no such thing as zero risk. The explanations provided by the RPD are correct.\nANALYSIS\nStandard of review\n[7] My role is to review all the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.2\nRole of the appellant\n[8] The onus is on the appellant to identify the errors that are the grounds of the appeal and where the said errors are located.3\nFramework of analysis\n[9] The RPD concluded that the appellant's claim is not based on one of the grounds set out in the Convention and that the claim must therefore be analyzed under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The appellant did not challenge the framework of analysis. Because the appellant fears an individual who seeks to avenge his family's honour for relations outside marriage, I am of the opinion that the RPD's conclusion is correct.\nCredibility\n[10] The RPD considered that the appellant's testimony was generally credible. It found the appellant credible with respect to the events that took place in Algeria, including the XXXX 2019 assault and that of XXXX 2019. I am of the opinion that the conclusion is correct regarding the sincerity of the appellant's fear of his agent of risk. Therefore, subject to comments on the reliability of the evidence, I find the appellant to be credible.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in its analysis of state protection\n[11] The RPD reiterated the principles set out in Ward,4 which establishes that a refugee protection claimant must provide clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect absent an admission by the national's state of its inability to protect that national. Accordingly, prior to seeking the protection of another country, refugee protection claimants must demonstrate that they took every reasonable measure to seek the protection of their home state.\n[12] The appellant testified that he did not report his agent of risk to the authorities, either after the threats of XXXX 2019 or when he was beaten outside a XXXX in downtown Algiers in XXXX 2019. When asked to explain why he did not file a complaint, he stated that it was because the police in Algeria do not intervene in domestic matters and that the police would not have done anything to help him. He feared that the police would have placed the blame on him, because he had a relationship outside marriage. He also feared being targeted by his agent of risk if he filed a complaint. He alleges that his girlfriend warned him that her brother was engaged in drug trafficking in the neighbourhood and that he feared him for this reason. He asserts that his agent of risk may have contacts with the police.\n[13] The RPD conducted an analysis of the objective evidence, which demonstrates that the Algerian police may be considered effective. The evidence shows that the murders that have been committed have been addressed. The evidence does not show statistics regarding honour crimes, but these are extremely rare and infrequent in urban areas. They generally occur in rural areas. In the last few years, the Algerian police have deployed significant resources to ensure the safety of citizens, resulting in a 4% reduction in non-political crimes in 2016, including assault and voluntary manslaughter. As the RPD stated: [translation] \"It appears that the government has taken reasonable measures to establish and run an effective legal system for detecting, prosecuting and punishing acts that constitute persecution and that this system is generally accessible to Algerian citizens.\" It concluded that the Algerian state has the ability and the will to implement effective measures to protect its citizens, ensuring adequate protection.\n[14] On appeal, it is argued that the RPD erred in its analysis and its conclusions regarding state protection. The appellant submits that the objective documentation demonstrating crime control relates to non-political crimes and not to honour crimes. He submits that Algerian law is the law of Islam, which does not permit relations outside marriage. He adds that, while honour crimes are rare, they do exist and that the state does not wish to intervene in honour-related matters. He argues that the RPD's analysis of whether his agent of risk could be a person of interest to the police because of his drug-selling activities is completely unrelated to honour crimes.\n[15] After analyzing the documents cited by the RPD and the appellant, I am of the opinion that honour crimes are rare in Algeria. They occur mainly in rural areas, [translation] \"where the honour of women is governed by a stricter code of conduct. In urban areas, where education levels and socio-economic development are higher, honour crimes are infrequent\" [emphasis added].5 I am of the opinion that the appellant's arguments are not supported by documentation that is as categorical as he asserts. It is true that the police may be reluctant to interfere in people's private lives. However, the documentation shows that the victims of honour crimes are generally women. The documentation presented by the appellant before the RPD6 relates events where crimes committed against men occurred when they were caught in the act. It also shows that the perpetrators of these crimes were either arrested and detained or received prison sentences.\n[16] On the basis of these facts, it cannot be concluded that Algerian nationals cannot seek state protection, given the principle that no state can guarantee full protection. The onus is on the refugee protection claimant to show, on a balance of probabilities, that they cannot obtain state protection. This is assessed based on the refugee protection claimant's personal situation, the alleged risk, the agent of persecution and the country conditions. The country conditions were analyzed and the RPD's conclusion is correct with respect to the country conditions.\nPersonal situation, risk, agent of risk\n[17] The appellant testified that his agent of risk threatened him after discovering the relationship that he had with his sister. He allegedly attempted to attack him with a knife in XXXX 2019. The appellant reportedly took refuge at his grandmother's home in downtown XXXX, where he lived without any problems until XXXX 2019. He stated that as he was leaving a XXXX in downtown Algiers he ran into his agent of risk, who assaulted him and left him unconscious. The appellant testified that he did not file a complaint because the police were reluctant to deal with domestic matters. In addition, he did not dare to file a complaint against his agent of risk, who sells drugs in the district where he lived, which made him a dangerous person who could attack him again if the agent of risk learned that a complaint had been filed against him. He also asserts that it is possible that his agent of risk is in collusion with the police. Lastly, he fears that the police would place the blame on him because of the extramarital relationship that he had with his ex-girlfriend, as relations outside marriage are frowned upon in Algeria.\n[18] The RPD considered that the appellant's answers were not satisfactory. According to the RPD, citizens are responsible for seeking and obtaining protection from their state authorities, except where it is objectively reasonable not to do so. The RPD considered that the appellant's reluctance to request protection was based on speculative subjective fears that are not corroborated by the evidence.\n[19] The appellant repeats the arguments that Algerian justice is lax when it comes to private matters. The police are rarely cooperative, and relationships outside marriage constitute the primary motive for honour crimes. He argues that the RPD minimized the risk by relying on generalities. For the appellant, even though the risk is greater in rural areas than in urban areas, the risk in urban areas is not zero. In addition, no formal investigation has been carried out regarding the prevalence of honour crimes in Algeria. Nonetheless, such events are reported in the Algerian press or in autobiographical works from time to time. He adds that he established that his girlfriend's brother is a dangerous drug trafficker who is involved in organized crime. Responding to the RPD's argument that reporting a drug trafficker would benefit the appellant, he argues that there is no connection between organized crime and the honour crime that he fears. He argues that Algeria is a Muslim country whose state religion is Islam and relations outside marriage are forbidden in Islam. This means that he cannot trust the police to press charges against his girlfriend's brother.\n[20] I disagree with the appellant's arguments. The burden is on him to rebut the presumption of state protection. The evidence that he provided shows that women who bear children out of wedlock face discrimination, based on women's premarital chastity.7 As noted by the RPD, the news articles produced by the appellant demonstrate that perpetrators of honour crimes against men have been arrested, detained or even sentenced to prison terms. I added that the articles are about men who were caught in the act and perpetrators who had an immediate and spontaneous reaction, which is not the case for the appellant. The fact that the appellant is able to identify his agent of risk is not insignificant. Filing a complaint about death threats from a drug trafficker is no small matter. Fearing that the police will not assist him, in these circumstances, is not reasonable. No evidence was submitted by the appellant other than social condemnation of women who have had relations outside marriage. His argument that relations outside marriage are prohibited in Algeria and, consequently, subject to state penalties, was not provided. I agree with the RPD that the fears raised by the appellant for not having at least attempted to seek state protection are founded on speculative subjective fears. I would add that the appellant's perception may be sincere, even though satisfactory evidence for his arguments cannot be established on a balance of probabilities. The RPD's conclusion is correct.\nFailure to provide reasons and to formulate clear conclusions\n[21] The appellant argues that the RPD failed to provide reasons and to formulate clear conclusions. In passing, he cites case law stating that \"the reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible that the claimant may know why his claim has failed and decide whether to seek leave to appeal, where necessary.\"8 He argues that the panel ignored essential evidence establishing the appellant's prospective risk, namely the newspaper articles he filed to show that honour crimes are frequent in Algeria, although the National Documentation Package on the country lacks sufficient information concerning such crimes. He reiterates that he risks suffering the same fate should he return to Algeria.\n[22] I disagree with the appellant. The reasons raised by the RPD are based on section 97 of the IRPA.9 He attempted to prove that he cannot avail himself of state protection due to the various fears raised. Each fear was fully analyzed by the RPD. He clearly fears his ex-girlfriend's brother. However, insofar as the brother first attempted to harm him in XXXX 2019 and attacked him in XXXX 2019, the door is open to ask the police to intervene, especially since the attacker has been identified. That is the crux of the reason why the appellant failed in his claim. The evidence submitted does not meet the balance of probabilities threshold. The fact that the appellant lived without any problems from XXXX to XXXX 2019 (more than five months) does not demonstrate the fear that prompted him to seek protection in Canada. Accordingly, the reasons stated by the RPD are intelligible, clear and precise for the purpose of understanding that the appellant did not provide evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that the Algerian state would not have responded to his request for protection. The RPD's reasons are well articulated and, in my view, the crux of the decision is based on this lack of evidence and on the evidence that establishes the willingness of the Algerian state to protect its citizens.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD's determination that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nCharles Gauthier\nCharles Gauthier\nFebruary 15, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.

In its view, it was inconsistent for the appellant to have indicated in an immigration form that her husband would accompany her to Canada, when she stated that her relationship with him was almost non-existent because of her political involvement. It concluded that there was an omission in the appellant's written account and a contradiction in her testimony regarding a notice to appear that the police had allegedly sent her, and it did not give any weight to it or to the other notice that was apparently left at her home in Kinshasa.\n[4] The appellant alleges that the RPD erred in refusing to consider that she had misspoken as to when she had learned that the police had sent her a second notice to appear and in concluding that the notices to appear contained irregularities. She submits that the RPD incorrectly drew a negative inference from her expressed desire that her husband accompany her to Canada, when she just wanted to avoid breaking the bonds of marriage.\n[5] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is of the view that the determinative issue is credibility. The RAD does not find the appellant to be credible.\n[6] The RAD confirms the determination of the RPD and dismisses the appeal.\nBACKGROUND\n[7] According to the appellant's written account1 in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), she was part of the XXXX movement, which advocates for human dignity and social justice. This allegedly created tensions with her husband, who was a member of the former ruling party, the Parti du peuple pour la reconstruction et la d\u00e9mocratie (PPRD) [people's party for reconstruction and democracy]. Although she was still married, her relationship with her husband was almost non-existent. In XXXX 2019, XXXX reportedly organized a demonstration calling for former president XXXX to be prosecuted for his crimes. The appellant apparently did not take part in it. A friend who worked at the ministry of the interior allegedly told her to be careful, as the authorities were looking for XXXX supporters. After taking two trips in 2019, one to Canada and another to Dubai, the same friend reportedly told her that she had information that the authorities believed that she was mobilizing people to finance the DRC's balkanization. The appellant allegedly decided to leave the DRC, and did so on XXXX XXXX, 2020, when she went on a previously planned trip to visit her son in Canada. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, her children, who lived in Kinshasa, allegedly informed her that the police had left a summons (hereinafter notice) at her home. The appellant reportedly claimed refugee protection in Canada in October 2020.\n[8] In her amended written account,2 submitted on XXXX XXXX, 2022, the appellant adds that another notice from the police was delivered to her home on XXXX XXXX, 2020.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[9] In her appeal record, the appellant included the following documents as new evidence in addition to an affidavit in support of her memorandum (a letter and number have been used to identify each document in order to facilitate referencing them in these reasons):\nA-1: Divorce petition dated XXXX XXXX, 20223\nA-2: Notice of divorce proceedings dated XXXX XXXX, 20224\nA-3: Appellant's affidavit in support of her memorandum5\n[10] The admissibility of new evidence before the RAD is subject to the application of subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and the criteria set out in Raza,6 as adapted in Singh.7\n[11] In order for it to be admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, the appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of the claim or that was not reasonably available, or that she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. If evidence is admissible within the meaning of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, it must meet the criteria of credibility, relevance and newness as stated in Singh.\n[12] The RPD hearing was held on June 16, 2022, and the decision was rendered on July 14, 2022.\nDocuments entered as A-1 and A-2\n[13] Along with the documents entered as A-1 and A-2, the appellant submitted a DHL envelope8 addressed to someone who is apparently her son and who received it on XXXX XXXX, 2022.\n[14] The RAD is of the view that the documents entered as A-1 and A-2 meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, but that they are not relevant, and it does not consider them to be admissible.\n[15] The RAD noted that the petition entered as A-1 bears a date that is after the hearing but prior to the rejection of the refugee protection claim and that it concerns facts that also predate it. According to the petition, the spouses' ideological differences stemming from the appellant's membership in a citizen movement that opposes her husband's political party are such that they jeopardize the sustainability of the couple's relationship, the appellant abandoned the home a relatively long time ago and, according to the most recent information, she has settled in Canada. The notice of the petition for divorce, entered as A-2, postdates the RPD's decision. The appellant allegedly received the two documents after the RPD's decision. The appellant alleges that she was not aware of the steps taken by her husband and that she found out about them when she received the documents entered as A-1 and A-2, and that these documents were therefore not available. The RAD considers that documents A-1 and A-2 were not available before the claim was rejected and concludes that they meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[16] The appellant submits that the documents entered as A-1 and A-2 are relevant, credible and new as defined in Singh. The RAD does not agree. It has no reason to question their genuineness given their source, a law firm that allegedly represents the appellant's husband, and the fact that they were sent to the appellant's son. It also considers them to be new, as they concern facts that would not have been known to the appellant at the time of the hearing. However, the RAD is of the view that the documents are not relevant in deciding the determinative issue of the credibility of the appellant, who, as explained later in these reasons, did not establish a political profile as a basis for a reasonable prospective fear of persecution.\nAffidavit entered as A-3\n[17] The appellant submitted an affidavit in support of her appeal memorandum, which the RAD considers to contain new evidence. The RAD conducted the analysis below to determine whether this new evidence is admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and Singh. It concludes that it is not.\n[18] The RAD noted that paragraphs 1 and 2 refer to the appellant's BOC Form, and that paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 and part of paragraphs 7 and 8 contain statements that constitute the arguments that the RAD will take into account in its analysis.\n[19] Furthermore, the appellant states the following at paragraph 7: [translation] \"Yet, despite the fact that my relationship with my husband is almost non-existent, I have never stopped loving him. He is the father of my children. I continue to believe, perhaps naively, that he will finally come to realize that my fight is a noble one.\" Here, the appellant adds to the testimony that she provided at the hearing, according to which her relationship with her husband had become almost non-existent, which must be assessed based on the criteria of new evidence. The RAD does not consider this to be admissible new evidence because it did not arise after the claim was rejected, and the appellant does not explain why it was not reasonably available or why she could not have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it, and the RAD does not see it. The RAD comes to the same conclusion regarding the allegation at paragraph 8 that reads as follows: [translation] \"As a Christian, I consider marriage to be a sacred sacrament that must be maintained no matter the cost.\"\n[20] The RAD does not admit the documents entered as A-1, A-2 and A-3 as new evidence.\nREQUEST FOR AN ORAL HEARING\n[21] In her memorandum, the appellant asks that an oral hearing be held if the RAD questions the credibility of the new evidence, in order for her to respond orally to any questions it may have.\n[22] In order for the RAD to hold an oral hearing, the conditions set out in subsection 110(6) of the IRPA must be met, which includes the existence of new evidence.\n[23] There is no new evidence.\n[24] The RAD therefore may not hold an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[25] The RAD conducted an independent assessment of all the evidence, which included listening to the recording of the RPD hearing, took into account Guideline 4, updated in July 2022 and entitled the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board,9 and applied the standard of correctness.10\n[26] The RPD analyzed the refugee protection claim under section 96 of the IRPA given the nexus with one of the Convention grounds, namely, political opinion. The RAD agrees with this point of view, which the appellant is not contesting.\n[27] In Alazar,11 the Federal Court held that procedural fairness requires that the Minister be given notice when a new issue is being considered by the RAD as well as the opportunity to make submissions, even if the Minister has not intervened before the RAD. Relying on the definition of a new issue set out in Mian,12 the Federal Court held that notice must be given to the Minister whenever the answer to the following question is affirmative:\n[84] ... To reiterate, the question is whether the ground on which the RAD decided the appeal is a new issue in the sense that it is legally and factually distinct from the grounds of appeal advanced and cannot reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the respondents (the respondents being the only party to the appeal for the purpose of this part of the analysis). Only if this question is answered affirmatively will it have been a breach of the requirements of procedural fairness for the RAD to decide the appeal on the basis that it did without first providing the Minister an opportunity to be heard in relation to it.\n[28] The RAD concluded that its intention to examine [translation] \"the appellant's political profile as a basis for a reasonable prospective fear of persecution,\" which was not broached by the RPD or by the appellant in her memorandum, constituted a new issue and it gave the Minister and the appellant a notice.13 The RAD did not receive any submissions from the Minister or from the appellant within the time limit.\n[29] In the same notice, the RAD asked the appellant to provide it with the originals of the two notices to report to the DRC's national police, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, which the appellant had submitted to the RPD as C-3. The appellant submitted the documents to the RAD within the time limit.\nCredibility\n[30] The RPD did not find the appellant to be credible. The RAD's finding is the same.\n[31] The RAD considers the issue of the appellant's political profile to be determinative. It is of the opinion that the appellant did not establish, with credible and sufficient evidence, her political profile as a basis for a reasonable prospective fear of persecution. That being said, the RAD nevertheless analyzed the notices to appear from the national police, which, according to the appellant, had been left at her home in Kinshasa in XXXX 2020 while she was in Canada, because they are the reason she provides for fearing the authorities. The RAD did not give them any weight. The RAD did not examine the impact that the appellant's involvement in XXXX had on her relationship with her husband, which had been analyzed by the RPD, or the appellant's arguments about this in her memorandum, as this impact is not relevant in deciding the determinative issue.\nNotices to appear\n[32] The appellant alleges that the two notices to report to the police were left at her home in Kinshasa while she was in Canada. The subject headings of the notices read [translation] \"Invitation\" and the reasons given are [translation] \"Information requested.\" The notices ask the appellant to report to the general intelligence division of the national police at the address indicated. The notice of XXXX XXXX, 2020, contains a summons for XXXX XXXX XXXX and the notice of XXXX XXXX, 2020, includes a summons for XXXX XXXX. The following note appears on the notice of XXXX XXXX XXXX [translation] \"Note: If you fail to comply with this notice, you will be summoned by force.\"\n[33] The RPD found that the appellant's credibility was undermined by her failing to mention the XXXX XXXX notice in her initial written account, without a satisfactory explanation. Furthermore, the RPD did not give any weight to the notices to appear given the circumstances in which the appellant had received them, and it noted they contained one irregularity, namely, the fact that the national police stamps appeared under, not over, the signature information. The RAD reaches the same conclusion as the RPD.\nFailure to mention the XXXX XXXX notice to appear in the initial written account and contradiction in the appellant's testimony\n[34] The RPD found that the omission and contradiction pertained to a central element of the appellant's story and undermined her credibility, and that she had not established, on a balance of probabilities, that she in fact received a notice to appear on XXXX XXXX, 2020, summoning her to the national police and that, if she failed to report, she would be summoned by force. The RAD shares this view, pointing out, as mentioned above, that it is of the opinion that the appellant did not establish her political profile.\n[35] In her initial written account included in her BOC Form, signed on XXXX XXXX, 2020,14 the appellant states that a first notice to report to the police was left at her home in Kinshasa after XXXX demonstration on XXXX XXXX, 2020, and that her children told her about it on XXXX XXXX, 2020. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, the appellant submitted an amended written account that included an addition and a date correction, and the addition regarding a second notice to appear that was allegedly left at her home on XXXX XXXX, 2020.15\n[36] The RPD sought to understand why the second notice to appear was not mentioned in the appellant's initial written account even though it predated the signing of the written account. It found that the appellant's credibility was undermined by this omission for which there was no satisfactory explanation.\n[37] According to the RPD, the appellant first testified that on XXXX XXXX, 2020, when she was in Canada, her children told her that a notice to report to the police had been left at her home in Kinshasa and that, that same week, her children informed her that a second notice to appear had been received asking her to report to the police on XXXX XXXX. The RPD stated that, when confronted with the fact that she did not mention this in her initial written account, the appellant's response was: [translation] \"I think that you did not understand me correctly, Madam Member. I said that the first time, they told me about the first notice, and later they told me that there was another notice and that I had to report on the XXXX.\" The RPD asked the appellant when her children had told her about the second notice and, after pausing to think, she answered: [translation] \"It was later. I think it was at the end of XXXX.\" The RPD did not find this response to be credible. After listening to the recording of the hearing again, the RPD noted that the appellant had initially testified as follows:\n[Translation]\nThe first notice was delivered on the XXXX. They did not tell me about it because they had no electricity. We spoke about it on the XXXX. It was later that week that we spoke and that they told me that there was another notice asking me to report to the police on XXXX XXXX, 2020.\n[38] The RPD stated that it confronted the appellant about this contradiction a bit later during the hearing and that she reiterated that the RPD had misunderstood her answer.\n[39] The RPD drew a negative inference from the appellant's failure to mention the notice to appear of XXXX XXXX, 2020, in her initial written account, from the contradiction in her testimony as to when she learned about this notice, and from her answer suggesting that the RPD had misunderstood her statement, when the recording of the hearing demonstrates the opposite.\n[40] In her memorandum, the appellant alleges that the RPD erred in refusing to consider that she had misspoken as to when she found out about the second notice to appear. She had testified that it was in XXXX 2020, after she submitted her BOC Form. The appellant submits that she erred in stating that she had found out that she had received the second notice the week of XXXX XXXX, 2020. After the RPD asked her why she had not mentioned this in her written account, she immediately stated that she had not known about it at that time and reiterated several times at the hearing that she had not found out about the second notice until XXXX 2020. She also mentioned that if she had indicated that she had found out about it in XXXX 2020, it had been a misunderstanding on her part or an error in how she expressed herself. The appellant submits that the RPD should have given her the benefit of the doubt. The appellant criticizes the RPD for conducting a microscopic analysis. The appellant refers to a decision16 in which the Federal Court drew such a conclusion in a case where a refugee protection claimant confused the date (February 29 instead of February 28). The RAD is of the opinion that the situation is different in this case, as explained below.\n[41] Upon listening to the recording of the hearing, the RAD noted that the RPD correctly recounted the appellant's testimony.17 It also noted that, when the RPD asked the appellant to describe how she had learned that the XXXX XXXX notice to appear had been delivered, she testified spontaneously about the two notices to appear. As indicated in the excerpt from the testimony reproduced by the RPD and cited above, the appellant first mentioned the notice that had been delivered on XXXX XXXX, and she then explained that her children told her about the notice of XXXX XXXX that same week. It was not until she was confronted with her initial written account, which does not mention the second notice, and the RPD repeated its question confronting her about that written account, that the appellant answered that the RPD had misunderstood her. According to the RAD, this is not a slip with regard to a date, but rather a different course of events.\n[42] Furthermore, in the RAD's view, it is inconsistent that the appellant's children told her about the notice of XXXX XXXX, 2020, three months later, when she testified18 that she talked to them every two or three days and that she was able talk to them every day if they had something in particular to discuss, especially since the second notice to appear included a threat-[translation] \"Note: If you fail to comply with this notice, you will be summoned by force\"19-which was not made in the first notice.\n[43] Contrary to the appellant, the RAD is of the opinion that the circumstances in which the benefit of the doubt may be given, as set out by the Federal Court in Gebrewold,20 are not present:\nAs the Court noted in Noga v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCT 454 [Noga], the benefit of the doubt principle \"applies in a limited number of circumstances\". Benefit of the doubt should be given only \"when all available evidence has been obtained and checked and when the examiner is satisfied as to the applicant's general credibility\", which assumes that the applicant's statements are \"coherent and plausible\" (Noga, at paragraphs 10 to 12). [emphasis added]\n[44] The RAD agrees with the RPD's conclusion that the appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she received a notice to appear on XXXX XXXX, 2020, summoning her to the national police and that she would be made to appear by force if she failed to comply.\nNo weight given to the notices to appear\n[45] The RPD did not give any weight to the above-mentioned notices to appear given the credibility issues as to the circumstances in which they were received. It noted, in passing, an irregularity regarding the notices: the stamps of the DRC national police appear under, not over, the information related to the signature.\n[46] In her memorandum, the appellant argues that the RPD erred in concluding that the notices contained irregularities. She submits that the RPD did not have them analyzed to draw such a conclusion. She agrees that the RPD could rely on its specialized knowledge, as it appears to have done, but that, in a case like this, it had the obligation to notify her. The appellant alleges that, at the hearing, the RPD did not raise the anomalies that it had noted, which would have given her the opportunity to provide an explanation or submit the original notices to appear for the RPD to examine them. The appellant submits that this is a breach of natural justice.\n[47] The RAD does not accept the appellant's arguments. Contrary to the appellant's statement, the RAD is of the view that the RPD was not obligated to submit the notices to appear for expert assessment in order to conclude that they contained anomalies, and neither does the RAD. In the RAD's opinion, simply examining the placement of a seal on a document does not fall under a decision-maker's specialized knowledge, which is knowledge accumulated over time as a result of their adjudicative functions. Furthermore, according to the Federal Court,21 it is well established that the principles of procedural fairness do not require claimants to be confronted with information that they are aware of and that they themselves supplied. Therefore, the RAD is of the opinion that there was no breach of procedural fairness, as the RPD analyzed the notices to appear submitted by the appellant and it did not base its conclusion on an extrinsic element.\n[48] As noted above, the RAD asked the appellant to provide it with the original notices to appear, and she submitted them. The RAD examined the originals and noted anomalies that led it not to give them any weight.\n[49] The RAD is aware of the Federal Court case law22 according to which syntax errors, which could be likened to typographical or inadvertent errors, should not normally discredit a piece of evidence. The RAD is of the opinion that the notices to appear contain not only errors of that kind, but also other anomalies that led it to not find the notices genuine.\n[50] The notices were issued by the same person four days apart. However, the date is indicated with a date-stamp in the notice of XXXX XXXX, 2020, and it is handwritten in the notice of XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020. The title of the signatory is typed in both notices. The XXXX XXXX notice refers to \"Le Chef de D\u00e9partement des Operations de la Direction des Renseignements\", whereas the XXXX XXXX notice reads, \"Le Chef de D\u00e9partement des Op\u00e9rations \u00e0 la Direction des Renseignements\". The RAD also noted that, in the copy of the XXXX XXXX notice that the appellant submitted to the RPD,23 the title was different from the one indicated in the original document that the appellant submitted to the RAD, which starts with \"Ce\" instead of \"Le\": \"Ce Chef de D\u00e9partement des Op\u00e9rations \u00e0 la Direction des Renseignements\". The RAD would have expected the typed title of the person who signed both notices to be the same not only in the originals, but also in the copy submitted by the appellant. In addition, as highlighted by the RPD, the national police stamps that appear on both notices are under the title, name and signature of the author of the notices, as is the stamp of the signatory, which appears only on the notice to appear of XXXX XXXX, 2020. Finally, the RAD noted that the XXXX XXXX notice contains a spelling error and that the days are not capitalized the same way in XXXX XXXX and XXXX notices: \"Madame, Vous \u00eates pri\u00e9 de vous pr\u00e9senter ce Lundi XXXX XXXX 2020, \u00e0 mon office...\" and the XXXX XXXX notice reads: \"Madame, Vous \u00eatre pri\u00e9e de vous pr\u00e9senter ce vendredi XXXX XXXX 2020, \u00e0 mon office...\".\n[51] In light of all the previously noted anomalies, the RAD agrees with the RPD's conclusion that no weight should be given to the two notices to appear submitted by the appellant.\n[52] The RAD considers that the RPD correctly concluded that the appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she received a notice to appear dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, summoning her to report to the DRC national police and that, if she failed to appear, she would be summoned by force; that no weight should be given to the notices to appear; and that the appellant's credibility was undermined.\nThe appellant's political profile\n[53] The recording of the hearing reveals that the appellant testified24 that she was generally targeted by the authorities, as she was part of XXXX, and that she was criticized for her awareness-raising initiatives in favour of the DRC's balkanization.\n[54] In her written account,25 the appellant states that she had advocated for respect and human rights when she was very young, and that it had therefore been easy for her to support the ideology of XXXX, which was established in 2012. The appellant states that, even though there was a change in presidents with the election of F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, former president XXXX XXXX continued to pull the strings and control most strategic posts. She notes that XXXX and other movements often held demonstrations calling for certain rights, but that those demands were never heard or taken into account and that demonstrations were brutally repressed. The appellant reports that there was a XXXX demonstration in XXXX 2019 calling for former president XXXX to be prosecuted for his crimes. She states that she did not take part in it, but that some of her associates who participated were arrested and later released.\n[55] In listening to the recording of the hearing, the RAD noted that the appellant testified26 that she became a member of XXXX in 2015 and that she was still a member. When she lived in the DRC, she was part of a cell comprising seven people. She was in charge of XXXX. Her role was to XXXX XXXX XXXX about XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. She XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. Some participants chose to join the movement, whereas others refused because they were afraid. The appellant indicated27 that she started her recruitment efforts in 2016 and that she continued them until she left the DRC. The appellant testified28 that she never participated in any demonstrations because she was somewhat worried, which she explained as being due to the fact of her husband's membership in the party that XXXX opposed.\n[56] The appellant testified29 that the police had not questioned her before the first notice to appear dated XXXX XXXX, 2020. The RPD asked why the police would go after her in 2020, when she had been a long-time member of XXXX. She answered that it was because of the added story of balkanization.30\n[57] The appellant testified31 that her problems started after the demonstration of XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, which she did not take part in, when two members of her cell who had participated in it were arrested, tortured and released after five days. She confirmed32 what she had described in her written account, that a friend who worked in the ministry of the interior had told her to be careful because the authorities were looking for all XXXX members, but that she had not been worried because she had not taken part in any demonstrations. The appellant then testified33 that the same friend told her on XXXX XXXX, 2020, that she had information that she spent time abroad to raise awareness of the DRC's balkanization. The appellant stated34 that although this conversation [translation] \"alarmed her,\" she did not consider it to be serious. She found it strange that anyone would accuse her of balkanization, when this was not in line with XXXX, a movement that advocates human dignity, respect and social justice, as well as leaving the DRC's territory as is, whereas balkanization involves carving up the DRC. The appellant testified35 that her associates had problems after taking part in a demonstration-which, according to her written account, took place on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, while she was in Canada-to protest the appointment of XXXX XXXX, and that the notice to appear of XXXX XXXX, 2020, was subsequently left at her home. The appellant testified36 that she had no trouble leaving the DRC for Canada in XXXX 2020.\n[58] For the reasons set out below, and in light of the objective documentary evidence, the RAD is of the opinion that the appellant did not establish, by means of sufficient and credible evidence, that she has the profile of a political opponent who would likely be sought by the authorities if she were to return to the DRC.\n[59] According to her written account and her testimony at the hearing, the appellant did not personally have any problems with the authorities between the time she became involved with XXXX in 2016 and the time she left the DRC in XXXX 2020. She never participated in a demonstration. Her alleged balkanization efforts were not consistent with her efforts at XXXX. The alleged notices to appear were delivered to the appellant's home in XXXX 2020, when she had been in Canada for several months and, according to her, issued after a demonstration that she did not take part in. The authorities gave her no trouble when she left the country. The appellant did not state, in her written account or at the hearing, that her children, who still live in Kinshasa, received other notices37 or that the authorities contacted them after the notice of XXXX XXXX, 2020.\n[60] According to the objective documentary evidence, the XXXX members who experienced problems with the authorities are those who participated in demonstrations or who had spoken out publicly, particularly about the alleged misappropriation of funds by the foundation of the DRC's First Lady. The appellant did not demonstrate that she has such a profile.\n[61] The National Documentation Package (NDP) on the DRC reports, at Tab 1.18,38 on the key role played by XXXX:\nIn the pre-electoral period between 2016 and 2018, several new youth movements (e.g., XXXX, Filimbi and R\u00e9veil des indign\u00e9s) emerged, and played a remarkable role in raising public awareness of and denouncing civil rights violations. This continues to be the case with regard to the killings that have been perpetrated in Beni, in the province of North-Kivu since 2014 and which have suddenly intensified since President Tshisekedi took office. While several civil society organizations seem to have grown weary, the youth movements (XXXX and Veranda Mutsanga, especially) continue to vocally denounce the inaction of the government and the U.N. forces of MONUSCO, which are stationed around the areas where these killings are perpetuated. (p. 26)\nThe COVID-19 crisis had a rather positive effect on solidarity and self-organization, which seem to be growing. For example, in the city of Goma (North Kivu), one of the most prominent citizen movements, XXXX, began organizing marches in June 2020 to demand the supply of drinking water and denounce the passivity of the authorities that left a large proportion of the population dependent on obtaining drinking water from wells. (p. 14)\n[62] At Tab 2.9 of the NDP,39 a Human Rights Watch report on the events of 2021 in the DRC states that activists were intimidated, threatened, arrested, and in some cases prosecuted. It notes that the arrests involved members of the movement who reportedly participated in demonstrations, with the exception of a case involving XXXX members who allegedly denounced the First Lady. The appellant did not allude to ever speaking out publicly and stated that she never participated in demonstrations. The report states that, in January, a military court acquitted eight members of XXXX who spent one month in detention for marching peacefully in Beni. In July, two members, who had been detained for three months for marching peacefully in Butembo, were provisionally released. Two other members were arrested in July and August, detained and then released on bail on November 6. Their trial for defamation and criminal association started on November 5, after they denounced the misappropriation of humanitarian aid allegedly involving staff from the DRC's First Lady's foundation. Thirteen other XXXX activists were arrested in Beni on November 11 during a peaceful demonstration against martial law, and remained in detention at the time of the writing of the report.\n[63] Tab 2.140 of the NDP reports on the case of two XXXX members who were involved in the allegations of misappropriated funds by the First Lady's foundation. According to Human Rights Watch, one of them faced the death penalty because of the charges and, after four months of detention, he was provisionally released. It also describes that, in January, a military court in Beni acquitted eight XXXX members who faced 10 years in prison after being arrested during a march, that XXXX was denied the right to protest in Butembo on February 15, and that when it held a protest demanding the opening of the schools that had been closed due to COVID-19, the police whipped protesters, injured 17 of them and arrested 21, who were released three hours later.\n[64] According to the RAD, the political engagement that the appellant submitted as evidence does not establish that she would have a well-founded prospective fear of persecution if she were to return to the DRC.\n[65] The RAD is of the opinion that the RPD correctly found that the appellant is not credible.\n[66] The RAD agrees with the RPD's conclusion that the appellant did not demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA or that she would, on a balance of probabilities, be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to her life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if she returned to the DRC.\n[67] The RAD concludes that the RPD's decision is correct.\nCONCLUSION\n[68] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the determination of the RPD that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nIsabelle Parizeau\nMe Isabelle Parizeau\nJanuary 11, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Refugee Protection Division (RPD) record, at pp. 21 to 23.\n2 Ibid., at pp. 12 to 14.\n3 Appellant's record, at p. 9.\n4 Ibid., at p. 8.\n5 Ibid., at pp. 4 to 7.\n6 Raza v.

He is appealing the rejection of his refugee claim by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). He alleges he faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a likelihood of harm at the hands of his father and Islamic extremists because he converted to Christianity.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention1 refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant was born to a conservative Muslim family and grew up a devout Muslim. His mother and father are Yoruba, and he was born in Lagos State. The Appellant met XXXX, his now-ex-wife, in 2006 while in theXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX introduced the Appellant to Christianity and began inviting him to her church.\n[4] One day, the Appellant alleges he was evangelizing when members of XXXX XXXX, an Islamic extremist group, reported the Appellant's activities to his father. The Appellant's father hit him, cursed him, and threatened to kill him. Eventually the Appellant was allowed to come back home, but he did not stop dating XXXX.\n[5] In 2012, XXXX became pregnant, and gave birth in 2013. The Appellant proposed to her. XXXX agreed to marry him on the condition that he become \"accept Christ as [his] Lord and personal savior.\"2 He started attending church every Sunday and they were married in 2014.\n[6] Following their wedding, the Appellant and XXXX moved in with his parents. After the Appellant's family found out he converted to Christianity, his siblings and parents began fighting with the Appellant and XXXX. His family threatened to use charms and cast spells on the Appellant and XXXX. Consequently, the Appellant alleges XXXX asked for a divorce and moved back in with her parents.\n[7] One night, the Appellant overheard his father speaking Arabic with his followers. He could not understand the conversation well, but the Appellant's sister allegedly warned him to pack his bags and leave. The Appellant, XXXX, and their kids took a night bus to Abuja where they moved in with his Christian friend. The Appellant testified that they lived there peacefully for approximately five months.\n[8] In 2015, the Appellant was invited to a friend's wedding in the United States (US). The Appellant and XXXX obtained US visas and arrived on XXXX XXXX, 2015. In 2016, the Appellant had his third child. Due to financial issues, the Appellant and XXXX's marriage suffered, and she filed for divorce. The Appellant was officially divorced from XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[9] In XXXX 2016, the Appellant alleges he met another woman, XXXX, a US citizen. They fell in love, and \"she could take good care of [him] financially.\"3 The Appellant married XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The Appellant was detained for two weeks in XXXX 2018 because his US visa had expired. He realized he had to apply for permanent residency. He submitted his I-130 application (non-citizen spouse) for permanent residency in XXXX 2018.\n[10] In 2018, the Appellant alleges XXXX began seeing her ex-boyfriend. After confronting her about the affair, XXXX stopped cooperating with the Appellant's application for permanent residency. The Appellant and XXXX divorced in XXXX 2019.\n[11] The Appellant had a Final Master immigration hearing set for XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. Fearing deportation, the Appellant abandoned proceedings and left the US for Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[12] According to the law,4 I can only accept evidence that arose after the RPD decision; or was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that could not reasonably have been expected to be submitted to the RPD before the decision. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.5\n[13] The Appellant bears the onus of demonstrating how the following items meet the criteria for new evidence:\n* Transcription of voice message between the Appellant and his mother, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Transcription of voice message between the Appellant and XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* XXXX XXXX XXXX (Canada) employment letter, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Letter of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Copy of baptismal certificate; and\n* Affidavit of XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.\nThe transcriptions are rejected\n[14] The RPD rendered its Decision on July 18, 2022. The Appellant submitted transcriptions of voice notes between himself and his mother and between himself and XXXX XXXX. The transcriptions are typed and allege that the conversations took place on XXXX XXXX, 20226 and XXXX XXXX, 20227 respectively. Despite the voice notes post-dating the RPD's Decision, I find that the transcriptions do not provide any new information pursuant to the Singh\/Raza factors. Both transcriptions merely reiterate the Appellant's core allegations that he chose Christianity over Islam, that his father is angry, and that his father has threatened to harm him. On its face, it is unclear what new value the transcriptions bring to the Appellant's refugee claim. Therefore, the transcriptions are rejected.\nThe employment letter is rejected\n[15] The Appellant submitted an employment letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX (Canada). Although the letter post-dates the RPD's Decision, the letter states that the Appellant started working for the company on XXXX XXXX, 2021, an event that pre-dates the Decision. Considering he started the position nearly one year prior to the RPD Decision, I find the evidence was reasonably available at the time of the decision and that it could reasonably have been expected to be submitted to the RPD before the decision. Additionally, it is unclear what relevance the letter has in addressing the RPD's credibility findings. Therefore, the employment letter is rejected.\nThe baptismal certificate and accompanying letter are rejected\n[16] The Appellant submitted a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Pastor in Charge at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to the baptismal certificate, the Appellant was baptized in XXXX 2010. The letter is intended to authenticate the baptismal certificate the Appellant also submitted as proof of his conversion to Christianity. Consequently, both documents are inextricably linked at must be assessed together.\n[17] The Appellant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019. He was interviewed by a Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer on XXXX XXXX, 2019. In that Port of Entry (POE) interview, the Appellant was asked when he converted to Christianity. He responded that he was baptized and became a Christian in 2011. When asked whether he had documents corroborating his conversion, the Appellant responded that a thief had stolen them while he was in the US. The Appellant also testified to this at the RPD Hearing.\n[18] On appeal, the Appellant submits that these documents could not reasonably have been produced at an earlier date, however he provides no explanation as to why. He further argues that he could not have reasonably been expected to produce the documents because he could not have anticipated the RPD's negative credibility findings.\n[19] I reject both explanations. First, the case law has been clear that credibility is always a live issue at the RPD. Furthermore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Appellant was alerted to the importance of proof of his conversion on XXXX XXXX, 2019 during the POE interview. The Appellant signed his Basis of Claim (BOC) on October 16, 2019, only ten days after his POE interview. According to his BOC, he was aided by counsel to complete the form. The first page of the BOC form clearly states that the Appellant is responsible for obtaining and providing any documents that may support his claim. The Appellant's baptism is central to his claim that he converted to Christianity. So, it is reasonable to infer that if the document existed, he would have been able to obtain it prior to the RPD's Decision being rendered.\n[20] Given the importance of the baptism, the fact that the Appellant was aided by counsel in completing his BOC, and the nearly 20 months he had to secure and provide the documents to the RPD, I find the Pastor's letter and the baptismal certificate were reasonably available at the time of the decision and that they could reasonably have been expected to be submitted to the RPD before the decision. Therefore, both documents are rejected.\n[21] In the alternative, I also find the baptismal certificate is not credible. Consequently, the Pastor's letter is also not credible. The baptismal certificate appears to be a computer printed document. Due to the inconsistencies, strange formatting, and unnecessarily duplicative information, I find that the document is more likely than not fraudulent.\n[22] First, while the church's logo is centered in the document, the typed headings \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX...XXXX XXXX XXXX\" are not. The words are squished around the logo, kissing the edge of the logo as if the document was altered. Second, the document is unnecessarily duplicative. The address of the church appears both in the heading of the certificate, under \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\", and again within the church's logo. I am mindful of importing Canadian design standards to documents issued in other countries, however in this case, I find that it seems illogical that the document would contain the address of the church twice and so close together.\n[23] Third, the logo oddly bisects the words \"Certificate of Baptism.\" The logo appears as though it was not designed to fit in its location, or in the alternative, that the wording was added to fit around the logo. Furthermore, the Appellant's date of birth, XXXX XXXX, 1986, appears in small lettering directly under the church's logo, as though it is part of the logo. His place of birth, XXXX Lagos Nigeria, appears squished against the right border of the document. Both lines appear above \"Solemnised in the Parish of XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" It is reasonable to expect that these two fields of information would not appear in these locations. Taken together, the odd placement of these two fields of information strongly suggests the document was doctored.\n[24] The document also contains two decorative circles. The decorative circle on the right is smaller in size compared to the decorative circle on the left. Finally, there are several different fonts that appear all over the document, including in the heading of the table containing the Appellant's baptismal information. For example, \"DATE\" appears all in uppercase letters. It is the only heading that appears all in uppercase. The term \"Baptized,\" found directly underneath the date in that column appears in a different font and lowercase letters.\n[25] I note that the objective documentary evidence indicates the prevalence of fraudulent documents in Nigeria.8 I also note that during his POE Interview, the Appellant admitted to submitting a fraudulent voter card and a fraudulent international driver's licence,9 further illustrating the prevalence of fraudulent documents in Nigeria. Considering the major inconsistencies within the document, the objective documentary evidence, and the Appellant's POE Interview, I find that the baptismal certificate is likely not genuine, on a balance of probabilities. Consequently, the letter claiming to authenticate the baptismal certificate is not credible. Therefore, both documents are rejected.\nThe sister's affidavit is rejected\n[26] The Appellant submitted an affidavit from his sister, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022. The document details events that occurred prior to the RPD rendering its Decision, and merely reiterates the Appellant's BOC allegations. On appeal, the Appellant argues that he could not have reasonably submitted the affidavit because it was \"solely created following the credibility findings made by the RPD.\"10 Again, it is the Appellant's onus to provide evidence in support of his claim at the outset of his refugee application. The case law has established that the criterion for new evidence is not intended to correct deficiencies in the Appellant's initial claim.\n[27] The Appellant had 20 months to secure and provide the affidavit to the RPD. He was represented by counsel when completing his BOC. He also has not provided a reasonable explanation for why he could not obtain this information prior to the RPD Decision. Therefore, I find the Appellant's sister's affidavit was reasonably available at the time of the Decision and that it could reasonably have been expected to be submitted to the RPD before the Decision. Consequently, the affidavit is rejected.\nOral Hearing\n[28] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, the new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the Appellant's credibility; is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.11 All three criteria must be met to hold an oral hearing. Since I have rejected the Appellant's new evidence, I do not have the jurisdiction to hold an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\nRole of the RAD\n[29] After conducting an independent assessment, I find that the RPD did not have a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony, therefore I have assessed the RPD's Decision on a correctness standard.12\nCredibility\n[30] The Appellant must present clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to credibly establish the facts of his claim, on a balance of probabilities. Sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt its truthfulness.13 The presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation and can be rebutted where inconsistencies, omissions, incoherent or vague testimony, raise credibility concerns.14\n[31] After conducting an independent assessment of the evidence, I find that the RPD was correct in determining the Appellant failed to credibly establish the core allegations of his refugee claim. I found the Appellant's testimony to be evolving, to conflict with his BOC narrative, and I\nfind that his evidence undermines his subjective fear. As I am not required to address every single RPD credibility finding, I will only address those findings that, cumulatively, are determinative of the Appellant's claim.\nBaptism did not occur as alleged\n[32] At the RPD Hearing, the Appellant testified that he was baptized in 2010, and chose his baptismal name XXXX. He also stated that in 2010 he became a Christian by mouth. However, during his POE Interview, when asked when he converted to Christianity, the Appellant responded, \"I converted to Christianity in 2011. That is when I was baptised and became a Christian.\"15 When asked to explain the discrepancy, the Appellant testified that he was not in his right frame of mind during the interview because he had lost his luggage in transit to Canada.\n[33] I am mindful of the case law concerning POE notes. I am also mindful of the stress refugees experience during CBSA interviews. However, I also note that the interview took place four days after the Appellant arrived in Canada. Furthermore, the Appellant had already been living outside of Nigeria for several years and was far removed from the alleged agent of persecution for a long time.\n[34] I found the Appellant's account of his Christian conversion confusing and evolving. According to his BOC narrative, XXXX became pregnant in 2012 and gave birth in 2013. He subsequently proposed to her and at first, she turned him down. However, she later accepted on the condition that he accepted Christ as his Lord and personal saviour. The claimant subsequently told her to give him time. Read together, these statements imply that the Appellant had not been baptized yet.\n[35] The Appellant was asked to explain why he testified to being baptized in 2010, but his BOC stated that he had not accepted Christ until as late as 2013. The Appellant testified that after he was baptized in 2010, he was missing church a lot, and his wife meant that she wanted him to be a full Christian by attending church every Sunday. On appeal, the Appellant argues that he was ceremoniously inducted as a Christian in 2010 but did not fully practice the religion until he married XXXX in 2013.16 He further argues that the discrepancy between the two dates is not evidence of an inconsistency, but rather a \"natural progression in the Appellant's faith.\"17\n[36] I do not accept this explanation and find that the Appellant's testimony evolved to account for the inconsistency respecting the date of his alleged baptism. In his BOC narrative, the Appellant claims to have \"started having interest in Christianity\" in 2010.18 He further alleges that he was baptized in early 2010. Considering the significance of converting from Islam to Christianity, I find that it is unlikely, a devout Muslim would be baptized while merely having an interest in Christianity. While the Appellant's BOC mentions attending XXXX's church, it does not expressly mention being baptized. I find this is a material omission because baptism is a significant event in a Christian's religious journey. Finally, his wife's requirement for him to \"accept Christ as [his] Lord and personal savior\", uses language specifically associated with a baptismal ceremony. Consequently, I make a negative credibility inference and find that the Appellant had failed to credibly establish that he was baptized as alleged.\nInconsistencies, contradictions, and omissions respecting father's alleged attacks\n[37] According to his BOC narrative, when the Appellant's father discovered him evangelizing on the street, he beat him, cursed him, and threatened to kill him. The Appellant testified that he lived at various churches and did not return home for months. According to his POE Interview, the Appellant stated that after his father found him preaching Christianity, the Appellant returned home after a week and found that the locks were changed. He also told the Officer that he left to go live with a friend. When asked to explain the discrepancy between living at churches for months and staying with a friend, the Appellant responded that he was not in his right mind. He also testified that his friend was connected to the church.\n[38] I agree with the RPD and do not accept the Appellant's explanation for these discrepancies. Considering the importance of his movements following his father's attacks, I find it unreasonable that the Appellant would make two irreconcilable statements about where he stayed and the length of time he stayed there. Furthermore, the Appellant clearly stated on several occasions that he stayed in churches and never mentioned staying at a friend's place until he allegedly fled to Abuja. Consequently, I find that the Appellant's movements after his father's attack did not occur as alleged.\n[39] At the RPD Hearing, the Appellant testified that after finding out that he had impregnated XXXX in 2012, his father beat him and almost killed him. He testified that his father pinned him to the ground and asked for is sword in Arabic. He ran away and stayed at churches on and off for many months. While the Appellant's BOC specifically states that he and XXXX were not allowed to live in his father's house because she was pregnant out of wedlock, it does not mention the alleged beating. When asked why his BOC doesn't mention the beating in 2012, the Appellant responded, \"Yeah, I stated it in 2021, He didn't strike me, he almost killed me, but it was my mom's intervention that always helped me.\"19\n[40] I find that the Appellant did not provide a reasonable explanation for the omission. I find this is a significant omission considering the alleged brutality of the attack. The Appellant submitted photographs of scars he obtained from alleged beatings from his father but failed to account for these incidents in his BOC narrative, undermining the credibility of his allegations. Due to the cumulative inconsistencies, contradictions, and significant omissions, I draw an overall negative credibility inference respecting the alleged attacks from his father.\nCohabitation with XXXX\n[41] The RPD asked the Appellant when he and XXXX began living together. The Appellant testified that they lived together for the first time in the US in XXXX 2015. According to the Appellant's BOC they both moved into his parents' house. When asked to explain the discrepancy, the Appellant testified while they lived in his father's house, the Appellant and his wife did not sleep in the same room. Therefore, he did not consider it living together. I disagree with the RPD's finding and accept the Appellant's explanation for the discrepancy. Given the cultural and religious context, it is reasonable that the Appellant may define living together differently.\n[42] Having said that, I find the fact that the Appellant and XXXX moved into his father's home after they married in 2014 significantly undermines his subjective fear. Prior to marrying, XXXX and the Appellant's newborn twins were living safely at her parents' place. At the time of their marriage, the Appellant's family knew that XXXX was Christian. The Appellant alleges his father beat him and threatened to kill him in 2010 after being caught evangelizing and then in 2012 after the Appellant impregnated XXXX. Given the level of hostility, threats, and physical violence allegedly committed by his father, I find it unreasonable that the Appellant moved his wife from the safety of her parents' home to his father's home. Consequently, I find this significantly undermines the Appellant's subjective fear and undermines his overall credibility respecting his father's alleged violence and role as the agent of persecution.\nFailure to claim asylum in the US\n[43] In XXXX 2015, the Appellant and XXXX travelled to the US on a tourist visa, valid for six months. The Appellant testified that he did not file for asylum when he arrived because he did not know about it. He further testified that Barack Obama was still President, and friends told him if he did not commit any crimes, he would be fine. Therefore, he chose to remain in the country without status.\n[44] While failure to seek protection in another country is not determinative of a claim, it can be a relevant factor in considering the Appellant's subjective fear. I find the Appellant's explanation for why he did not claim asylum in the US unreasonable. The Appellant is an educated individual, who obtained a XXXX XXXX XXXX in Nigeria. I note that he applied for the tourist visa to enter the US, thereby demonstrating some knowledge and experience with immigration processes. His testimony indicates that he gave thought to his ability to remain in the country under President Obama. It also indicates that he relied on the advice from friends and sought legal advice.\n[45] The Appellant also testified that he and XXXX were having financial problems which led to their divorce in XXXX 2017. According to his BOC he, \"met a lady who fell in love with [him] and was ready to take good care of [him] financially\"20 which caused him to change towards his first wife XXXX. He subsequently married XXXX, a US citizen, in XXXX 2017. In his POE Interview, he indicated that he thought marrying XXXX would give him status in the US, however it did not. After they also divorced, the Appellant abandoned his immigration proceedings and came to Canada.\n[46] In his POE Interview, when asked whether he ever made an application for refugee protection in the US, the Appellant responded, \"No, I just didn't want to. Also, because Trump is President, I didn't think my application would be successful.\"21 The Appellant arrived in the US in XXXX 2015. His US visa expired XXXX XXXX, 2015. Barak Obama served as President until January 20, 2017, over two years past the Appellant's visa's expiration. Consequently, I find it is unreasonable for the Appellant to rely on Trump's immigration policies to explain why he did not apply for asylum in the US.\n[47] I agree with the RPD and find the Appellant's failure to file for asylum in the US is not the behavior of someone who has a subjective fear for their safety in Nigeria. As a result, I draw a negative credibility inference.\nChurch letter\n[48] The Appellant submitted a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in North York, Ontario. The letter indicates the Appellant joined the church sometime in XXXX 2021, when the Church was not fully opened to the public due to COVID-19 restrictions. Given my credibility concerns, I agree with the RPD that the letter cannot independently corroborate the Appellant's allegations that he converted to Christianity in Nigeria, nor can it corroborate his core allegations against his father. Consequently, I give it little weight and find that it does not overcome the material inconsistencies, contradictions, and omissions cited above.\nPsychological Assessment Report\n[49] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD failed to assess the Appellant's psychological report. I disagree. The Appellant provided a psychological report by registered psychotherapist XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The report clearly indicates that the diagnostic impression is based on the Appellant's self-report during the clinical interview and the objective measure administered. The report also indicates that while the Appellant presented as being anxious, his memory and concentration were adequate to interview.\n[50] The Appellant's Rey 15-item Memorization Test did not indicate any exaggeration of memory difficulties. He exhibited moderate depression symptomology and severe anxiety, symptoms which can be attributed to the refugee claim process. While the Appellant reported symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, and traumatic experiences, the psychological report cannot independently corroborate that this is a result of his alleged experiences in Nigeria. Furthermore, there is no evidence, based on the report, that these symptoms can account for the Appellant's credibility issues.\n[51] Furthermore, I find that the RPD adequately considered the Appellant's mental condition throughout the Hearing. The Member spoke clearly, asking the Appellant questions multiple times. The Member rephrased and explained questions to ensure the Appellant understood. The Member also paraphrased the Appellant's responses to confirm they understood the Appellant's answers correctly. The Member provided breaks throughout the Hearing. In its Decision, the RPD adequately considered the Appellant's responses given his cultural context and personal circumstances, namely the stressfulness of the refugee process.22 In any event, I have also independently considered the psychological report and find that it does not provide a reasonable explanation for the Appellant's credibility issues.\nAllegations against XXXX XXXX\n[52] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD misapprehended his basis of claim as being at risk of persecution or harm by his father only. He further argues that the RPD erred by solely concentrating on events relating to his father's threats and ignoring the objective basis of his refugee claim as a Christian convert at risk from other groups like XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[53] I disagree with the Appellant. The RPD and I have already found that the Appellant has failed to credibly establish the core allegations of his claim, namely that his converted from Islam to Christianity, that his father attacked and threatened to kill the Appellant because of his conversion, and that the Appellant fled Nigeria fearing religious persecution. Consequently, if the Appellant has failed to credibly establish that he is a Christian, then the RPD did not need to assess the Appellant's risk as a Christian more broadly in Nigeria.\n[54] Furthermore, beyond a blanket statement that Nigerian society is insecure because of XXXX XXXX and Fulani herdsmen, the Appellant has not made any specific allegations that he is being targeted by XXXX XXXX or any other group in Nigeria. All his allegations pertain specifically to his father who he alleges is a devout Muslim who threatened to kill the Appellant because he converted to Christianity. When asked what would happen if he returned to Nigeria, the Appellant replied that he \"would probably be killed, not immediately, but over time someone would probably come after me.\"23 The Appellant may have a general fear of crime and violence in Nigeria, evidenced by his POE Interview response. However, I find that this general fear is insufficient to ground a claim for refugee protection under the law.\n[55] I note that the Appellant claimed to have lived in Abuja peacefully for five months. While he mentions that XXXX XXXX bombed a nearby market in his BOC, he has presented no evidence in this regard. Furthermore, while the alleged bombing may have scared him, the main reason he and his wife left Nigeria was for a friend's wedding.24 Consequently, I find that the Appellant has failed to establish that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or likelihood of harm in Nigerian at the hand of XXXX XXXX or any other extremist group.\nCONCLUSION\n[56] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nL.

I am therefore addressing you and ask that you explain my decision to your entire family. You, your spouse and your minor children state that you are citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and fear persecution in that country.1\n[2] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the Minister) intervened in your refugee protection claim, submitting that your identity had not been established.2\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concluded that you had failed to establish your identity on a balance of probabilities.3\n[4] In your appeal memorandum, you submit that the RPD erred.4\n[5] According to my analysis of your record, the RPD did not commit the errors you allege. Consequently, your appeal is dismissed.\nANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\n[6] The role of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is to determine whether the RPD committed the alleged errors,5 without necessarily limiting itself to the arguments made in the appeal memorandum.6 The RAD is entitled to substitute its opinion for the RPD's if the RPD was wrong.7 Except in the limited circumstances set out in subsection 111(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD makes the final call, subject to judicial review, to promote finality in the refugee protection claims process.8\n[7] I have analyzed your record,9 in particular by reading the transcript of the hearing before the RPD10 and the documentary evidence. I have also applied the principle of responsive justification by ensuring that my decision is justified in light of the facts and law and considers the potential consequences for your life, liberty and dignity.11 Regarding the RPD's decision, I conclude that the correctness standard should be applied.12\nA. Errors that you allege the Refugee Protection Division made\n[8] According to the Refugee Appeal Division Rules, you must state: i) the errors that are the grounds of the appeal, and ii) where the errors are located in the RPD's decision or in the transcript or in any recording of the hearing.13\n[9] In your memorandum, you identify two issues:14 whether the RPD's assessment of your identity and credibility is reasonable; and whether the RPD based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.\n[10] Regarding the first issue, you submit the following:\n* The RPD erred by substituting its assessment of the documents that you submitted to the Urban Processing Centre, for the imprecise conclusion of the Minister's analysis, according to which these documents are altered, apocryphal or inconclusive.15\n* The RPD erred by not giving any weight to your birth certificate on the sole basis that according to the RPD, the content is not consistent with the account in your Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), while it ignored your testimony explaining the minor contradictions between your birth certificate and the information in your BOC Form.16\n* The RPD did not give any weight to your testimony regarding the authenticity policy, which explained that prior to 1987, a first name was not an essential part of a name and that you could use your father's second name as a post-name.17\n* The RPD wrongly found that your testimony regarding your parents' identity was not credible, as the varying order of names is not evidence of fraud in the African context.18\n* Regarding your date of birth in the border interview report, your previous counsel informed the Minister that the mistake was made by the Canada Border Services Agency. 19\n* Your spouse explained why she had stopped using her biological father's name.20\n* The RPD erred in its analysis of the family composition certificate, as it is the government of a state that decides the security features of an official document and the RPD cannot describe a document as apocryphal when the Minister's expert report does not draw that conclusion.21\n* The RPD cannot question a document that is recognized by the issuing authority, and your birth certificate was submitted with your passport application at your country's embassy.22\n* Any alleged flaws or shortcomings must be more than superficial or peripheral to the merits of the decision and should not constitute a minor misstep.23\n* The documents you produced to obtain your Congolese passport were authentic and the RPD's assessment to the contrary is unreasonable.24\n* The RPD erred in making a negative finding regarding your credibility based on the fact that you used fraudulently obtained Angolan passports to enter Canada, as you did not have Congolese passports, were fleeing persecution in the DRC and, in Angola, did not have legal status and were at risk of being forcibly returned to the DRC.25\n* You are contesting the RPD's conclusions, and you submit that it failed to consider all the documentary evidence produced, since the author of the reports states that there is nothing to suggest that the documents have been altered, and the analysis is inconclusive as to the documents' authenticity.26\n[11] As for the second issue, you submit the following:\n* The RPD erred by finding that your spouse's testimony regarding your children lacked credibility, as the RPD ignored significant evidence, relied on non-existent contradictions and did not consider your spouse's low level of education.27\n* The RPD used linear reasoning, did not appropriately examine the other evidence submitted and did not consider your knowledge of the DRC and your Congolese ethnicity.28\n* The Minister was unable to establish that the passports obtained in Angola were not authentic; however, the RPD considered your testimony that they were obtained fraudulently and, on that basis, did not accept the comprehensive analysis of the other documents, including your Congolese passports.29\n* The RPD unreasonably concluded that all your documents, including your Congolese passports, failed to establish your identity, ignoring your counsel's representations explaining the inconsistencies noted in some authentic documents issued by Congolese authorities.30\n* The RPD's reasons do not explain why it did not give any weight to the Congolese passports, authentic documents issued by the Congolese authorities in Ottawa, which is unreasonable.31\n* The RPD did not explain why it did not give any weight to the adults' birth certificates.32\n* The fact that the Minister's external analyses conclude that the documents are altered or apocryphal, or that the analysis is inconclusive, does not mean that the documents are fraudulent.33\nB. Refugee Protection Division's decision\n[12] In its decision, the RPD summarized your allegations,34 referred to the Minister's intervention,35 stated that the determinative issue was your identity,36 and concluded that you had failed to establish your identity on a balance of probabilities.37\n[13] I find it helpful to reproduce a few paragraphs from its decision, which explain its conclusion:\n[Translation]\nMinister's intervention\n7. The representative of the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (the Minister) submits that the claimants did not provide any original identity documents from the Congolese authorities to confirm their identity until the start of the hearing and that they failed to discharge their burden of establishing that their Angolan identities were fraudulently obtained.\nAltered or apocryphal documents: Submitted to the Urban Processing Centre\n8. The panel notes that the principal claimant's identity and that of his family members have not been established [l'identit\u00e9 du Demandeur principal et celle des membres de sa famille n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli (sic)38], on a balance of probabilities, by the documents submitted to the Urban Processing Centre for the purpose of establishing their identity. The panel does not accept those documents, in particular because the Minister's expert analyses conclude that the documents are altered or apocryphal or the analyses are inconclusive, and because following the panel's analysis, some contradictions unreasonably remain explained [sic]....\nDocuments received right before the hearing: Democratic Republic of the Congo passports\n17. The panel notes that the principal claimant's identity and that of his family members have not been established, on a balance of probabilities, by the passports submitted right before the hearing. The panel does not accept those documents, in particular because according to the principal claimant's testimony, the passports were obtained on the basis of a birth certificate that is considered apocryphal, which was submitted to the Urban Processing Centre, and because the process for obtaining the minors' passports is inconsistent with the documentary evidence....\nAuthentic documents: Submitted at Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle\n25. The panel notes that the principal claimant's identity and that of his family members have not been established, on a balance of probabilities, by the documents submitted when they entered Canada. The panel does not accept those documents, in particular because the principal claimant revealed during an interview at the port of entry and during the hearing that the documents are not authentic....\nCredibility of the testimony\n37. The panel could simply have noted that the principal claimant failed to diligently check the authenticity of the information provided in his forms if he had not also ordered apocryphal documents through his family in the DRC, obtained passports on the basis of these apocryphal documents and made contradictions during the hearing. The repeated submission in evidence of documents that are apocryphal or were obtained with fraudulent documents strongly affects the claimants' credibility with respect to their identity to the point that the panel concludes that they have rebutted the presumption of truthfulness of their testimony in this regard. Therefore, the panel does not give any weight to the claimants' statements regarding their identity.39\nC. The Refugee Protection Division did not commit the alleged errors\n[14] According to my own analysis of your record, the RPD did not commit the alleged errors by concluding that you had failed to establish your identity, for the following reasons.\nThe legal principles guiding the analysis of refugee protection claimants' identity\n[15] Determining whether a refugee protection claimant has established their identity is a question of fact and credibility.40 The onus is on them to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they are indeed the person they allege to be, since identity is crucial to any refugee protection claim.41 They must provide acceptable documentation establishing their identity, failing which they must explain why they do not have such documentation and what steps they took to obtain the documentation.42\n[16] It is the task of the trier of fact to weigh the documentary and testimonial evidence and to draw conclusions as to whether the evidence is sufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the identity of a refugee protection claimant.43 They may conclude that documents are fraudulent and have little or no probative value. They may also conclude that explanations provided for irregularities with respect to a document simply do not add up. In contrast, the finding that identity documents found to be false have an effect on a claimant's overall credibility must be cautiously approached.44 Although it is unreasonable to find that all the documents are fraudulent simply because a claimant submitted one that is, the documents used to persuade the authorities of a country to issue a passport may be analyzed, since the reliability of the passport is a function of the reliability of the documents used to obtain it.45\n[17] It is also well established that the determination of identity is at the core of the RPD's expertise.46 The RPD is not required to submit the identity documents before it for expert assessment provided that there is sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the authenticity of the document or to question the way in which an authentic document may have been obtained.47\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not commit the alleged errors\n[18] The RAD has jurisdiction to consider the question of a claimant's identity, and to intervene when the RPD is wrong in law, in fact or in fact and law.48 After reading and analyzing your arguments, the Minister's intervention, your testimony before the RPD and the RPD's decision, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not commit the alleged errors.\n[19] The main determinative issue in your refugee protection claim is your and your family's nationality, in other words, whether you are citizens of Angola or the DRC. A person's nationality or citizenship is a fundamental characteristic of their identity.49\n[20] You travelled to Canada with Angolan passports in which your identity is different from what you allege in your refugee protection claims, although the differences were less significant with respect to your spouse. Those passports state that you were all born in Angola.50 They also contain your fingerprints and visas issued by the American authorities.51 According to your testimony and that of your wife, you obtained those passports by paying for mafia services and providing false information.52\n[21] In your memorandum, you submit that the RPD erred in making a negative finding regarding your credibility based on the fact that you used fraudulently obtained Angolan passports to enter Canada, as you did not have Congolese passports, were fleeing persecution in the DRC and, in Angola, did not have legal status and were at risk of being forcibly returned to the DRC.\n[22] According to my own analysis of your record, your argument has no merit and, with respect to these issues, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err.\n[23] In its decision, the RPD stated that the Angolan passports were considered authentic but fraudulently obtained and therefore were not given any weight in establishing your identity.53 Obviously, a passport that was obtained fraudulently is not a credible or trustworthy document, as the presumption that foreign identity documents are valid is rebutted when identity documents have been fraudulently obtained.54\n[24] In its decision, the RPD also stated that in light of the many concerns about your credibility, it was unable to establish which of the passports submitted reflected your true identities.55 Credibility findings may be based on a lack of credibility concerning a passport and the fact that the refugee protection claimant was unable to explain the inconsistencies between various documents.56\n[25] Regarding the passports you obtained through the DRC embassy in Ottawa, the Minister had analyses carried out on the documents you submitted to obtain those passports.57 During the hearing before the RPD, you and your spouse were questioned at length regarding those passports and the documents used to obtain them, as well as regarding the information they contain, which does not always match statements you make in other documents.58\n[26] In your memorandum, you submit that the RPD made several errors in the analysis of your Congolese passports and the documents used to obtain them. In particular, you submit that the RPD cannot question a document that is recognized by the issuing authority-and your birth certificate was submitted with your passport application at your country's embassy-that any alleged flaws or shortcomings must be more than superficial or peripheral to the merits of the decision and should not constitute a minor misstep and that the documents you produced to obtain your Congolese passport were authentic and the RPD's assessment to the contrary is unreasonable.\n[27] With all due respect to your arguments, I do not consider them persuasive. In this regard, it should be noted that the reliability of a passport is always a function of the reliability of the documents used to obtain it.59 However, while making his representations during your hearing before the RPD, the Minister's representative noted the results of the analysis reports. He also referred to your explanations when you were confronted with errors in your own documents, and he argued that the RPD should conclude that you had failed to establish your identity.60 It is true that in his representations to the RPD, your lawyer stated that the errors in the documents that you used to obtain your DRC passports were not that significant, that the errors were attributable to the Congolese administration and that it had conducted its own investigations and checks before issuing your passports.61 Taking into account your lawyer's representations before the RPD and your arguments in your appeal, I cannot accept that you were able to obtain these passports without complying with the requirements set out by the DRC authorities.\n[28] In this regard, I note that during the hearing before the RPD, you stated that, to obtain DRC passports, you had an interview and submitted an identity document for your mother, one for your father and a photocopy of a birth certificate, as well as the marriage certificate and record of marriage, and that there were no other documents. As for your children, you stated that you had answered the questions you were asked, about where they were born, in Angola, and that you had not been asked for any documents for them.62\n[29] In its decision, the RPD very meticulously identified several anomalies or errors in your passports or in the documents you submitted to obtain them. It also noted that the DRC passports had been filed in evidence right before the hearing. It did not accept those documents because they had been obtained on the basis of a birth certificate that was considered apocryphal, which had been submitted to the Urban Processing Centre, and because the process for obtaining the minor children's passports did not match the requirements set out in the documentary evidence.63 Specifically, the RPD stated that according to the documentary evidence, obtaining a DRC passport requires a minimum of three documents per person: a police certificate, proof of nationality and proof of identity. In its decision, the RPD referred to tabs 3.5 and 3.6 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) on the DRC dated April 30, 2021.64\n[30] In the most recent version of the NDP, with respect to passport applications at the DRC embassy in Ottawa,65 I note at least one requirement that is identical to one of the three requirements listed by the RPD. Proof of Congolese nationality must be submitted in the form of a previous expired Congolese passport, a previous Zairian passport or a certificate of nationality issued by the DRC ministry of justice and human rights. However, according to your testimony, you did not submit such proof of nationality. As for the children, you did not submit their birth certificates or an attestation of their birth, nor did you submit copies of your and your spouse's voter cards or your and your spouse's passports.\n[31] Consequently, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not commit the errors you allege when it concluded that the documents you submitted to obtain your Congolese passports contain several anomalies or errors and that the process you used to obtain those passports did not match the requirements identified in the documentary evidence.\nSince your identity was not established, the Refugee Protection Division was not required to analyze your fear\n[32] Since your identity was not established, the RPD was not required to analyze your fear of being persecuted pursuant to section 96 or subjected to a risk pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.66\nCONCLUSION\n[33] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD's determination that you and your family members failed to establish your identity and, consequently, are not refugees under section 96 or persons in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA.\n[34] Your appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nAlain Bissonnette\nAlain Bissonnette\nMay 11, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Your Basis of Claim forms, including amendments, are reproduced at pages 15 to 123; the documents that you submitted in evidence are reproduced at pages 269 to 274; and the Consolidated List of Documents is reproduced at page 29 of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) record.\n2 The Minister's notices of intervention and documents M-1 to M-9, August 24, 2021, December 20, 2021, and March 30, 2022, are reproduced at pages 275 to 391 of the RPD record.\n3 RPD's Reasons and Decision, August 5, 2022, pages 3 to 14 of the RPD record.\n4 Your memorandum, September 20, 2022, pages 5 to 11 and 34 to 43 of your appeal record.\n5 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Alternatively, the RPD considered that the appellant had an internal flight alternative in Honduras.\n[7] Before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), the appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility for reasons that will be detailed below under the Analysis heading.\n[8] For these reasons, the appellant is asking the RAD to set aside the RPD's determination and grant him refugee protection.\nTHE STANDARD OF REVIEW AND THE ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[9] The role of the RAD is to review the RPD decisions on a standard of correctness after conducting its own analysis of the record in order to determine whether the RPD erred, as the appellant submits.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[10] The appellant submitted 10 documents (P-20 to P-29) before the RAD that he argues constitute new evidence under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, which states that:\nOn appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[11] In addition to the explicit conditions set out in subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD must also consider the implicit conditions on the admissibility of new evidence as established by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh (M.C.I. v. Parminder Singh, 2016 FCA 96), and in particular, the criteria of credibility and relevance of new evidence.\n[12] I do not accept these documents as evidence before the RAD for the following reasons.\n[13] First, in his memorandum, the appellant does not make any full and detailed submissions regarding how these documents meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and how they relate to him, as prescribed by subparagraph 3(g)(iii) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules. In his memorandum, the appellant merely states that these documents should be admitted into evidence (paragraph 36) and that subsection 110(4) requires that we make our best efforts to present the evidence at the first hearing and we did so (paragraph 37).\n[14] Nevertheless, I read the documents and I am of the opinion that there are other reasons for not admitting them as evidence before the RAD. In particular, in Eshetie (Eshetie v. M.C.I., 2019 FC 1036), the Federal Court writes that \"[a] RAD appeal is not a second chance to submit evidence to answer weaknesses identified by the RPD\" and that \"[a]n applicant is required to put his or her best foot forward to the RPD.\"\n[15] Exhibits P-20, P-21, P-22 and P-26 are, respectively, letters from a former XXXX colleague, the appellant's mother, a former police officer, friend of the appellant, and a former XXXX colleague. Although they are dated after the date when the claim was rejected, these four documents contain information that arose prior to the rejection date. As mentioned above, the appellant does not explain why this information was not available when the claim was rejected, or if it was, why it was not submitted before the RPD.\n[16] Exhibit P-23 is a Honduran document regarding the appellant's driver's licence. I do not see how this document is relevant to the refugee protection claim, and the appellant also does not explain this in his memorandum.\n[17] Exhibit P-24 is an undated, handwritten letter from the appellant's uncle, who has lived in Canada since 2004. He asks the Canadian authorities not to send the appellant back to Honduras and repeats some of the appellant's allegations, which the latter told him and which arose prior to the date when the claim was rejected. Once again, the appellant does not explain why this information was not available when the claim was rejected, or if it was, why it was not submitted before the RPD. Moreover, the mere fact that the appellant's uncle states that the appellant told him some of his allegations is insufficient to make said allegations credible.\n[18] Exhibits P-25 and P-27 are medical documents related to the appellant, which are dated after the date when the claim was rejected, but once again, they depict health problems that apparently began prior to said date. And once again, the appellant does not explain why this information was not available at the time when the claim was rejected, or if it was, why it was not submitted before the RPD. Furthermore, the appellant does not explain the relevance of this information to his refugee protection claim, namely how the information may explain the credibility problems that were raised.\n[19] Exhibit P-28 is a BBC article dated April 22, 2022, regarding drug trafficking in Honduras and the involvement of high-ranking government officials in it. In my view, this document is not relevant for assessing the credibility of the appellant's allegations. Furthermore, it adds nothing new to the record, since the issue of drug trafficking and corruption has already been mentioned in the IRB's National Documentation Package on Honduras (November 30, 2022), more specifically in the documentation in Chapter 7 (Criminality and Corruption) of that package.\n[20] Exhibit P-29 is an article from the PBS network dated November 18, 2022, which is also related to drug trafficking in Honduras and the involvement of high-ranking government officials in it. For the same reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph, I do not accept this document as evidence , especially since it arose prior to the date when the claim was rejected.\n[21] Since no new evidence has been accepted before the RAD, there is no need to hold an oral hearing in accordance with subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[22] The first issue in this case is whether the RPD erred in assessing the credibility of the appellant's allegations.\n[23] After analyzing all the evidence that was presented, including listening to the recording of the hearing before the RPD, the reasons for the RPD's decision and the appellant's arguments before the RAD, I find that the answer to this question is no, for the following reasons.\n[24] The RPD decision rests on its finding that the appellant's testimony generally was not direct, spontaneous and fluid, and on a series of contradictions and inconsistencies found in the evidence that, in its view, could only undermine the credibility of the appellant's allegations.\n[25] I also find that these factors, when taken as a whole, are sufficient to undermine his credibility.\n[26] The first of these factors is a contradiction between the appellant's allegation that he was extorted for money in XXXX 2017 by a woman named XXXX XXXX (who apparently was a former air force member) and the complaint as filed, which was in relation to this extortion, but instead states that the appellant had made a loan to this woman and that she refused to repay him (Exhibit P-8).\n[27] When asked by the RPD, after the hearing and in writing, to explain this contradiction, the appellant replied that there was no contradiction, in that he could be a victim of extortion and ask for the debt to be repaid.\n[28] Like the RPD, I do not consider this explanation to be reasonable. In my view, this is a major contradiction that deals with a fundamental aspect of the refugee protection claim. The appellant testified that this extortion in XXXX 2017 is a fundamental aspect of the problems that he experienced afterwards.\n[29] I find that it is impossible to reconcile the appellant's allegation that he was the victim of extortion and the content of the complaint (P-8), which reports an unpaid loan of money. In addition, the circumstances of the alleged extortion (in a garage in XXXX 2017, according to the BOC Form) and the facts stated in the complaint (a loan made on XXXX XXXX, 2017, in front of a bank to purchase a telephone, etc.) are completely different.\n[30] It seems unlikely to me that the appellant would file a complaint for an unpaid loan if he were the victim of theft and extortion. The appellant also does not state what civil legal measures he took to have this loan repaid, if there was such a loan, or why he waited until XXXX 2018 to report the extortion, which allegedly took place in XXXX 2017, if any extortion did in fact take place.\n[31] In its reasons, the RPD found that it was more likely to be credible that there was a loan between the appellant and Ms. XXXX than the allegation of extortion. For my part, I do not find that any of these allegations should be given credibility, given the significant contradiction that had no reasonable explanation.\n[32] The appellant also alleges that he withdrew this complaint after receiving telephone threats from Ms. XXXX immediately after filing the complaint. The RPD considers it surprising that the police accepted the complaint's withdrawal. However, in my view, this is a minor factor in the assessment of the appellant's credibility, as the RAD does not find the allegation of extortion to be credible.\n[33] Then, because this central allegation of the claim was found not to be credible, it follows that the subsequent allegations of Ms. XXXX involvement in the alleged threats and assaults also cannot be credible.\n[34] The appellant alleges that on XXXX XXXX, 2018, an individual on the street demanded medical prescription pads from him, otherwise there would be retribution. The appellant alleges that he filed a complaint with police immediately afterwards, with the national anti-extortion force, and that an officer from this force was assigned to him. He alleged that he received threatening messages on XXXX XXXX, in which it was suggested that he collaborate with [translation] \"the gang\" and hand over medical prescription pads. He was then reportedly assaulted in the street on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, by three people who asked why he had not handed over the prescription pads to them, and that they were sent by Ms. XXXX. The appellant alleged that the officer from the national anti-extortion force assigned to his case suggested that he leave his home, which he did, taking refuge at an aunt's residence.\n[35] Like the RAD, the RPD did not believe that Ms. XXXX was involved in these threats and assaults, for the reasons mentioned above. It must also be noted that the appellant did not submit as evidence any copy of the complaint that he allegedly filed about this or any document from his assigned officer. When asked about this, the appellant replied that he had not made any efforts to obtain any. This lack of effort is, in my view, an additional factor that undermines the appellant's credibility.\n[36] The appellant adds that he filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, accusing Ms. XXXX of being responsible for his problems and that an officer from this Commission had suggested that he leave the country. On that matter, the appellant argues that Exhibit P-14, which he submitted as evidence, corroborates this allegation of a complaint made to the Commission. However, it must be noted that this brief document from the Commission reports a complaint against [translation] \"an organized crime gang\", but does not give any other details or circumstances and makes no mention at all of Ms. XXXX.\n[37] In any case, even if the threats and demands for medical prescription pads were credible, the RPD still found that the evidence that was submitted did not demonstrate that these criminals were still interested in the appellant now, more than four years after the facts.\n[38] I have come to the same conclusion as the RPD in this matter. The only factor that, according to the appellant, shows that the criminals were looking for him is a telephone call that his mother received asking for him (the appellant). In my view, however, there is nothing to indicate that this call came from criminals seeking the appellant, since no threat was made. It does not seem plausible to me that a person would want to talk to the appellant, who suddenly went to live in hiding at his aunt's residence, for any reason other than a criminal one.\n[39] The appellant later testified that no one from his social circle was approached or threatened by anyone who would be looking for him in Honduras.\n[40] Therefore, I find that these facts, which have now occurred more than four years ago, do not demonstrate for the appellant a serious possibility of persecution or a probability that he would be subjected to a risk under section 97 of the IRPA if he had to return to his country. I must add that it seems more probable than not to me that the criminals who threatened the appellant in 2018 would simply try to extort another XXXX if they still wanted medical prescription pads to traffic medications, rather than try to track down the appellant.\n[41] In light of the above, it will not be necessary for the RAD to further assess the issue of whether the RPD's determination regarding the internal flight alternative is erroneous or not.\n[42] Lastly, in his memorandum, the appellant submits that being returned to his country, where he fears persecution, would contravene the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[43] I disagree with that submission.\n[44] First, the panel found that the appellant's allegations of a fear of persecution were not credible and that he had not demonstrated that he had a well-founded fear of persecution or a probability of being subjected to a risk if he returned to his country. Furthermore, neither the RPD nor the RAD is returning the appellant to his country. Their role is to determine whether the claimant can have status as a refugee or a person in need of protection, not to rule on his removal.\n[45] Considering the foregoing, I conclude that the appellant has not demonstrated that the RPD committed errors that would justify the RAD's setting aside the determination.\nREMEDY\n[46] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD's determination that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a \"Convention refugee\" under section 96 of the IRPA or a \"person in need of protection\" under section 97 of the IRPA.\n[47] The appeal is dismissed\n(signed)\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nJanuary 20, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MC2-17797\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

She claimed refugee protection in December 2020.\n[5] Following a hearing held on June 7 and August 15, 2022, the RPD rejected the refugee protection claim on the grounds that the appellant's allegations were not credible.\n[6] The appellant argues before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) that the RPD erred in its assessment of her credibility for reasons that are explained in detail in the Analysis section below.\n[7] For these reasons, the appellant is requesting that the RAD set aside the RPD's determination and grant her refugee protection or, alternatively, refer her case to the RPD for re-determination.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW AND ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[8] The role of the RAD is to review RPD decisions applying the correctness standard of review after conducting its own analysis of the record in order to determine whether the RPD erred, as the appellant alleges.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[9] The appellant submitted 21 documents to the RAD that she argues constitute new evidence under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which states:\nOn appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[10] In addition to the explicit conditions of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, the RAD must also consider the implicit conditions regarding the admissibility of new evidence as established by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh (MCI v.

Copy of the medical records of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the appellant's sister, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021\n[12] I do not accept these documents in evidence before the RAD, for the following reasons.\n[13] In my analysis, I am bearing in mind the remarks of the Honourable Justice XXXX of the Federal Court of Canada, at paragraph 33 of Eshetie (Eshetie v. Canada, 2019 FC 1036):\n[33] It is important to bear in mind that an analysis of the admissibility of new evidence before the RAD begins with the premise that the appeal of an RPD decision is intended to be a paper-based appeal (Singh at paras 35, 51). A RAD appeal is not a second chance to submit evidence to answer weaknesses identified by the RPD (Abdullahi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 260 at para 15):\n[15] In other words, responding to an inadequacy identified by the RPD in a party's case cannot be a legitimate foundation for the party to claim that had she known about the deficiency she could have presented better evidence that was always in existence from persons that could have been called, in this case from her cousin. This would make the RPD process a monumental waste of time, which is surely not Parliament's intention in providing appeal rights.\n[14] First, documents 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19 and 20 all arose prior to the rejection of the refugee protection claim. The appellant does not explain why these documents were not available at the time of the rejection or why she could not reasonably have been expected to have presented them. Document 2 includes an email that arose after the date the claim was rejected. This email is, in fact, the RPD's decision sent to the appellant by her counsel. In my opinion, this document does not meet the relevance criterion referred to above.\n[15] Document 3, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, is what the appellant calls her [translation] \"full written account,\" with translation. In reality, it is a new written account that should have been provided to the RPD with her BOC Form. There is no reason to provide a new one to the RAD. The appellant does not explain why this \"new\" written account was not provided to the RPD.\n[16] Documents 4, 5 and 6, are notarized statements, with translations, from the appellant's father, mother and brother, respectively, and are all dated XXXX XXXX, 2022. However, despite being dated after the rejection of the claim, all three statements reiterate what the appellant has already alleged and contain no new information from after the date of rejection of the hearing. The appellant does not explain why these documents were not provided to the RPD.\n[17] The same applies to documents 14 and 15, which despite being dated after the rejection of the claim, contain information that arose prior to that date. This information is contained in the appellant's allegations in her BOC Form and in her testimony. Once again, the appellant does not explain why these documents were not presented to the RPD.\n[18] Documents 16 and 21 are both related to the medical situation of the appellant's sister, who lives in Canada. Document 16 is a written authorization from the appellant's sister to disclose her medical records and it arose after the date of the rejection. Document 21 consists of the appellant's sister's medical records and contains information that arose prior to the rejection of the claim. The appellant does not explain why this information was not presented to the RPD, nor does she explain its relevance to her refugee protection claim.\n[19] Lastly, document 17 is a new translation of document C-14, which was before the RPD. Document C-14 is a statement by the appellant's mother, dated 2006, relating to the forced relocation of her family by a guerrilla group. I do not consider that this new translation of the document provides any new information to the case, given that the RPD did not question the eviction of the appellant's family from their land in 2006. This document does not meet the relevance criterion.\n[20] As no new evidence has been accepted before the RAD, there is no cause to hold an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[21] The issue in this case is whether the RPD erred in assessing the credibility of the appellant's allegations.\n[22] After analyzing all the evidence presented, including the recording of the hearing before the RPD, which I listened to, the RPD's reasons for decision and the appellant's submissions before the RAD, I am of the opinion that the response to that question is no, for the following reasons.\n[23] The RPD's decision was based on a number of omissions, contradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence presented which, in its view, undermined the credibility of the appellant's key allegations.\n[24] I am also of the opinion that, taken cumulatively, these elements suffice to undermine the appellant's credibility. These elements are the following:\n* Failure to state in her BOC Form that the threats from the FARC started again after the appellant and her family moved to the town of XXXX in 2006\n* Contradiction regarding the number of written summonses that her father allegedly received in XXXX: one, according to the BOC Form, or three, according to his testimony\n* Failure to state in her BOC Form that she and her family had lived in hiding in XXXX, as she testified\n* Contradiction or inconsistency between the allegation that she and her family were declared \"military objectives\" in 2006 and the fact that she apparently escaped the consequences of this for approximately 14 years, even after being tracked down by the FARC\n* Omission from her BOC Form that the motorcyclist who allegedly chased her in the town of XXXX yelled that he [translation] \"had found her\" and that she \"worked for the government,\" and that he allegedly asked her \"why she was hiding\"\n* Her delay in leaving her country, her voluntary return to Colombia after a trip to Ecuador and her delay in claiming refugee protection after arriving in Canada are behaviours that are inconsistent with those of a person who fears persecution in her country.\n[25] In her statement included in her appellant's record, the appellant first argues that the omissions and contradictions noted by the RPD are due to the fact that she was not adequately represented by her counsel before the RPD, who failed to inform her that she could amend her BOC Form and the attached narrative.\n[26] I cannot accept the appellant's explanation.\n[27] First, it must be noted that the appellant wrote a highly detailed narrative some ten pages long in her BOC Form, which shows that she had the ability to present her allegations. She also submitted 19 different documents in evidence before the RPD. Second, when the RPD asked at the start of the hearing whether the content of her BOC Form was [translation] \"true, complete and up to date,\" the appellant responded \"yes.\" That was the appellant's opportunity to state what, if anything, was missing from the form. The question was put to her, not to her counsel. Lastly, in her statement, the appellant herself states that she met with her counsel 12 times in order to prepare for her hearing. I find it inconsistent to subsequently allege a lack of preparation or inadequate representation by said counsel.\n[28] In her memorandum, the appellant claims a number of times that the fact that she is [translation] \"a young woman from a peasant background\" can explain the problems the RPD noted in the evidence presented.\n[29] Once again, I cannot accept this explanation.\n[30] First, the very fact of raising her peasant background, implying a lack of ability to give evidence, is the product of a stereotype that has no place before the panel. There is no evidence that being from a peasant background affects a person's ability to express themselves properly. Next, the evidence presented shows that the appellant has XXXX years of schooling, up to the XXXX level (see question 7 of the Schedule A document), and that she was able to write a structured story of ten pages to accompany her BOC Form.\n[31] Furthermore, in her memorandum, the appellant submits that the RPD erred in conducting a microscopic analysis of the evidence and in being [translation] \"overzealous\" on the subject of the omissions and contradictions it noted and that they were neither central nor fatal to her claim.\n[32] While it is true that any one of these omissions or contradictions, when taken individually, is probably not fatal to her refugee protection claim, I find that, cumulatively, the elements noted by the RPD irredeemably undermine the credibility of the appellant's key allegations.\n[33] Furthermore, some of those elements are more important than others.\n[34] For instance, I consider it significant that, in the span of nearly 14 years before the appellant left, the FARC never acted on their alleged designation of the appellant and her family as \"military objectives\".\n[35] As the RPD noted, the document at Tab 7.211 of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada's National Documentation Package on Colombia (August 31, 2022) states that when a person is declared a \"military objective,\" it means that their \"life, physical integrity, and freedom are endangered,\" and that the reason is to \"eliminate the presence of a leader or prominent person in the community.\" Another source indicates that it constitutes \"threat[s] to be killed.\" It is also stated that relocation within Colombia is not an option for those who have been declared a \"military objective\" because paramilitary and guerrilla structures have extended vertical organizations and large networks.\n[36] When asked about this, the appellant replied that they may be waiting on the order from their commanding officer to kill her. I agree with the RPD that this explanation is not reasonable under the circumstances, considering the foregoing documentary evidence, if the appellant and her family were genuinely declared \"military objectives.\" I find it inconsistent that the consequences of being declared a \"military objective\" were never enforced by the FARC over the course of all these years, either for the appellant or for the members of her family who still live in Colombia.\n[37] Furthermore, the appellant's behaviour with respect to her delay in leaving Colombia, her voluntary return to the country after a stay in Ecuador and her delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada after her arrival, considered cumulatively, in my opinion, undermines the credibility of her fear, and her key allegations as a result.\n[38] The appellant testified that her departure from Colombia was delayed by a lack of financial means. However, the appellant had held a job since at least 2016, in addition to pursuing XXXX studies. Her brothers and sisters also have jobs in Colombia. The appellant was also able to travel to Ecuador in 2019. It does not seem reasonable to me that, if she has feared for her life since 2006, she would not have taken advantage of an invitation from her sister in Canada to take refuge here before 2019.\n[39] The appellant then testified that she did not claim asylum in Ecuador during her stay there in XXXX 2019 because she did not know the procedure. However, she took no steps with the Ecuadorian authorities to find this out. I find that her lack of action in Ecuador is not reasonable if she truly feared for her life in Colombia.\n[40] The appellant testified that she waited almost a year after arriving in Canada to claim refugee protection because she was in shock, she did not know what to do and a lockdown had been declared because of the pandemic.\n[41] I agree with the RPD that these explanations are not reasonable. As stated above, the appellant is educated and was living in Canada with her sister and brother-in-law who had previously claimed refugee protection. Additionally, the lockdown began in XXXX 2020, three months after her arrival, and the lockdown did not prevent anyone from claiming refugee protection in Canada.\n[42] Lastly, the omissions and contradictions noted by the RPD and by the RAD while listening to the recording of the hearing, taken cumulatively, further undermine the appellant's credibility. The appellant testified that she intended to provide the details of her allegations during the hearing. However, it must be noted that the appellant provided a highly detailed 10-page narrative with her BOC Form, which renders her explanation unreasonable.\n[43] I am of the opinion that these contradictions and omissions do not pertain to peripheral elements of the claim. In particular, they include the omission of the threats received starting in 2006 after the appellant and her family moved to XXXX, the number of written [translation] \"summonses\" that her father allegedly received from the FARC, the omission from her BOC Form of her allegation that she was living in hiding in XXXX, while the evidence indicates that she was studying there openly, and the allegation that her father was summoned there by the FARC.\n[44] Considering all of the above, I conclude that the appellant has not established that the RPD made errors that warrant the RAD setting aside its determination.\nREMEDY\n[45] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD's determination, namely, that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" under section 96 of the IRPA nor a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[46] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nMarch 31, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 National Documentation Package on Colombia, August 31, 2022, Tab 7.21: What it means to be a 'military objective' (objetivo militar), including who executes these threats and methods of issuing them; whether there is an internal flight alternative for someone who has been issued a threat; state response.

The adult Appellants allege that they fear being detained and tortured, disappeared, or killed, by the Punjab police because of the Principal Appellant's association with a friend, BS1, an active supporter of Khalistan.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the Appellants' claims on May 24, 2022 and July 22, 2022. By decision dated August 26, 2022, the RPD rejected the claims. The determinative issues were internal flight alternative (IFA) and objective basis. The RPD found that the adult Appellants had viable IFAs in New Delhi and Mumbai and that the Appellants failed to establish that the Minor Appellant's fear is well-founded.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[4] My role is to look at all the evidence and independently determine whether the RPD made the correct decision.2 This is the general rule. Exceptionally, I may defer to the RPD on a credibility finding where the RPD had a meaningful advantage in assessing and weighing the credibility of the oral evidence. On reviewing the record, I do not find that the RPD had any meaningful advantage. Therefore, the standard of review is correctness.\nANALYSIS\n[5] As the adult Appellants' claims are based on a fear of persecution due to imputed political opinion, their claims have a nexus to the refugee Convention. The Minor Appellant's claim has a nexus to the Convention as it is based on a fear of persecution as the minor child of the adult Appellants. I have assessed the claims on that basis.\n[6] The RPD found that the Appellants did not meet their burden to establish that an IFA in Mumbai or New Delhi was not viable for them. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in assessing the viability of an IFA under both prongs of the legal test. They argue that the RPD erred in finding that the Minor Appellant's fear is not well-founded. I am not persuaded by the Appellants' arguments. On an independent assessment, I find that the adult Appellants have viable IFAs in Mumbai or New Delhi and that the Minor Appellant's claim lacks an objective basis. My reasons follow.\nThe legal test for an IFA\n[7] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have a viable IFA.3 Firstly, there must be no serious possibility of being persecuted, or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life, danger of torture, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA. The assessment of viability under the first prong requires considering the motivation and the capacity (means) of the agent of persecution or harm to locate the claimant in the IFA. Secondly, the conditions in the proposed IFA must be such that it would not be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, to go and live there. The threshold is high and requires nothing less than the existence of adverse conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the Appellants in travelling to or living in the IFA location. Actual and concrete evidence of adverse conditions is required.4\n[8] Once the issue of an IFA has been raised and a potential IFA location has been identified, the onus is on the Appellants to show that they do not have an IFA.5\nThere can be an IFA where the agents of persecution are state agents\n[9] The Principal Appellant and the Associate Appellant testified that they fear persecution by the Punjab police.6 The Appellants argue that there can never be an IFA where the agents of persecution are state agents. I disagree. The Appellants rely on the Federal Court's decision in Buyuksahin.7 They quote the following text: \"...an IFA analysis is appropriate only when the agent of persecution is not the state.\".8 This text must be read in the context in which it appears. In the same paragraph, the Court went on to say, \"As was stated by counsel, this is not a situation that is a local police issue - it is a country wide issue, because the persecution is occurring on a state-wide basis.\"9 The Court noted that, throughout the country, persons similarly situated to the applicant were being persecuted by state authorities. The Appellants also refer to the decision in Li and rely on the Court's statement that when a state participates in persecution, an IFA is not an option.10 The context, in Li, unlike the context of the Appellants' claim, was that central government forces were complicit in the persecutory acts.11 In other decisions, the Federal Court has made it clear that, where the agents of persecution are local police, a claimant who is of no interest to central authorities may be able to relocate to other areas.12 I find this to be such a case.\nThe RPD did not err by assessing the evidence as to the Principal Appellant's profile\n[10] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant is not, and never was, a supporter of Khalistan, on a balance of probabilities. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred because the issue to be determined was whether he faces a serious possibility of persecution because the Punjab police perceive him as a supporter of Khalistan. I am not persuaded that the RPD erred. The Appellants do not challenge the panel's finding that the Principal Appellant is not, and never was, a supporter of Khalistan. On reviewing the record, including the testimony given at the hearing, I see no error in it. Nor do I see any error in the RPD making this finding. If the Principal Appellant was an active supporter of Khalistan, this would be relevant to the assessment of his claim. For example, an active supporter of Khalistan might face a risk arising out of the exercise of their right to express their political opinion in the IFA. Such a risk would not arise for someone whose claim is based on a political opinion that is only imputed. As it is, the RPD accepted that the Appellants' evidence about the events they experienced in India was credible, unless specifically noted in the panel's analysis.\nThe RPD applied the correct standard of proof and the correct legal test in assessing whether the Appellants met their burden to establish that the IFA locations were not viable for them under the first prong of the legal test\n[11] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in assessing the viability of an IFA under the first prong of the legal test, the \"safety\" prong, by applying the wrong standard of proof and that this has tainted the entire decision.13 They argue that the RPD's analysis of the evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India with regard to the means and motivation of the Punjab police to locate them in the IFA is incorrect and that the RPD draws conclusions based on the wrong standard of proof.14 I am not persuaded by their arguments. I find that the RPD correctly stated and applied the principles that govern assessment of the evidence in respect of an IFA. My reasons follow.\n[12] Before I address the Appellants' arguments, I will explain what I mean by the terms that I will be using. Counsel's submissions refer to \"burden of proof\" and \"standard of proof\" interchangeably. I find it helpful to distinguish them, for the sake of clarity. In a claim for refugee protection, the burden of proof is on the claimant to establish their claim.15 The standard of proof for establishing allegations is \"balance of probabilities\".16 This is distinct from the legal test that a claimant must meet. For a claim with a nexus to the refugee Convention, the legal test is \"serious possibility\" of persecution.17 I agree with the Appellants' submission that they need not show future risk of persecution in an IFA location on a balance of probabilities.18 While facts must be established on a balance of probabilities, the test applicable to future risk of persecution is \"serious possibility\".\n[13] The Appellants argue that, throughout the decision, the RPD applied the \"balance of probabilities\" standard to the assessment of future risk. I disagree. In support of their argument, the Appellants refer to the following statements in the RPD's reasons, in which the RPD applies the balance of probabilities as the standard of proof:\n(a) \"For these reasons, the panel finds that there is sufficient evidence to\nestablish that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's arrest and detention\nwere illegal.\"19\n(b) \"Considering that the claimant's arrest and detention were illegal and that, to the knowledge of the claimants, no FIR was filed against them, nor any summons or arrest warrant issued against them since the claimant absconded from the conditions of his release and the co-claimant followed him to Canada, the panel finds that the claimants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Punjab Police identified them as a [sic] suspects in a case of \"major crimes\" or \"high profile organized crime.\"20\n(c) \"Having found that the claimant's arrest and detention were illegal, the panel\nalso finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of\nprobabilities, that the Punjab Police made a formal record of the claimant's\ndetention or entered his name into any criminal database shared between police\nforces, including the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems\n(\"CCTNS\").\"21\n(d) \"It is the burden of the claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he is named in a criminal database shared between police forces in different states.\"22\n(e) \"Considering the objective evidence altogether, the panel concludes that there is insufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that information about a person of interest is recorded in the CCTNS or any criminal database that is shared across states.\"23\n(f) \"For these reasons, the panel finds that the claimants did not establish, on a\nbalance of probabilities, that the either [sic] the claimant's arrest or any of their\nnames appear in any criminal database that is shared by police forces across\nstates, including the CCTNS.\"24\n(g) \"As such, the panel finds that the claimants did not establish, on a balance of\nprobabilities, that the claimant's fingerprints, photos, or other biometrics appear\nin any criminal database.\"25\n(h) \"However, having already concluded that the claimants did not establish, on a\nbalance of probabilities, that they are named in any criminal database, including\nthe CCTNS, or that there is a record of the claimant's arrest or biometrics in any\ncriminal database, including the CCTNS, [the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that police using the CCTNS to conduct tenant verifications in the proposed IFA locations would have the means to\nrecognize that the Punjab Police are looking for the claimants.]\"26 (Counsel's memorandum of argument does not quote the full text of the RPD finding. To reflect the finding in its entirety, I have added the text in brackets.)\n(i) \"Nevertheless, having already concluded that the claimants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that either their names or a record of the claimant's arrest or his biometric data are in any shared database of criminals or persons of interest, the panel concludes that this issue does not present a concern to the claimants.\"27\n[14] The Appellants also challenge the standard of proof applied to the following finding which does not explicitly refer to balance of probabilities:\n(j) \"The panel concludes, as a result, that there is insufficient evidence to establish that police departments actively contact other departments, other than in the exceptional case of \"major crimes\" or \"high profile organized crime.\"28\n[15] In my view, each of the findings cited by counsel, and set out in items (a) through (j), above, is a finding of fact, not an assessment of future risk. The RPD correctly applied \"balance of probabilities\" as the standard of proof.\n[16] In assessing future risk, the panel applied the correct legal test of \"serious possibility\". For example, in item (h), the text that counsel did not cite, and that completes the panel's finding, applies the \"serious possibility\" test. Furthermore, the RPD correctly stated that test in assessing future risk in numerous other instances, throughout the reasons. The panel made the following findings about future risk:\n* \"Under the first prong of the IFA test, the panel finds that the claimants did not establish a serious possibility that their agents of prejudice would be able to find them in either Mumbai or New Delhi.\"29\n* \"As such, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the Punjab Police either did or will communicate that they are looking for the claimants to the police in the proposed IFA locations.\"30\n* \"Considering the claimant's testimony, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish a threat to the safety of the claimant's parents and, as such there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the claimant's parents would reveal the whereabouts of the claimants in one of the proposed IFA locations to the Punjab Police.\"31\n* \"Similarly, although the panel accepts that the Punjab Police have visited the home of the co-claimant's widower father to ask about the whereabouts of the claimants, there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that he would reveal their whereabouts in one of the proposed IFA locations to the Punjab Police.\"32\n* \"The panel finds, however, that the fact that the co-claimant's father said this to\nthe police does not establish that there is a serious possibility that he would in fact endanger his daughter and her family by revealing their return to India. As such, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the co-claimant's father would reveal the whereabouts of the claimants in one of the proposed IFA locations to the Punjab Police.\"33\n* \"For these reasons, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the Punjab Police would be able to learn the whereabouts of the claimants in one of the proposed IFA locations from their families or other associates.\"34\n* \"The panel finds, as a result, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the Punjab Police would be able to find the claimants in one of the proposed IFA locations through the tenant verification if it is done using the CCTNS.\"35\n* \"Based on this evidence, the panel finds that even if the CCTNS is not used for the tenant verification, there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that tenant verification would enable the Punjab Police to find the claimants in one of\nthe proposed IFA locations.\"36\n* \"For these reasons, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the Punjab Police would be able to find the claimants in one of the proposed IFA locations through their use of their Aadhaar or other identification.\"37\n* \"For this reason, the panel finds that the claimants did not establish a serious possibility that the Punjab Police would have be [sic] able to locate them in the proposed IFA locations through a police clearance conducted by a prospective employer.\"38\n* \"The panel finds, as a result, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious\npossibility that the Punjab Police would be able to find the claimants because of customs controls when they enter India.\"39\n* \"The panel finds, as a result, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious\npossibility that the Punjab Police would be able to find the claimants because they would be failed asylum seekers upon their return to India.\"40\n* \"For all the above reasons, the panel concludes that the claimants failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk to life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in either of the proposed IFA locations.\"41\n[17] The Appellants' argument that the RPD applied the wrong test overlooks the need to begin by determining the facts that are relevant to means and motivation. While a conclusion as to the means and motivation of an agent of persecution is essentially a risk assessment, the conclusion will depend on relevant facts.42 The RPD applied the \"balance of probabilities\" standard to specific factual findings that are relevant to the motivation and means of the agent of persecution, the Punjab police, to track the Appellants in the IFA locations. I find the panel's approach consistent with what the Federal Court has identified as correct.43 In assessing future risk, the RPD applied the correct legal test of \"serious possibility\".\n[18] In any event, had the RPD erred by placing too high a burden on the Appellants in respect of the first prong of the test for an IFA, the error would not be determinative. This is because it is my role to conduct an independent assessment of the evidence, applying the correct legal test. Having done so, I find that the Appellants have not met their burden to establish that they face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA locations. My reasons follow.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellants did not establish the motivation of the Punjab police to pursue them in an IFA location\n[19] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in finding that the Punjab police have the means and the motivation that generates a serious possibility that they would find the Appellants in the IFA locations.44 The absence of either means or motivation is sufficient for a finding that the agent of persecution does not pose a threat to the Appellants in the IFA locations. I do not need to address the issue of means by which the Punjab police might locate the Appellants, because I find that the issue of lack of motivation is dispositive. Therefore, in the reasons that follow, I do not address arguments made by the Appellants that relate solely to the issue of means.\nThe RPD correctly found that there was insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the Punjab police would communicate to the police in the proposed IFA locations that they are looking for the Appellants\n[20] The RPD found that there was insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the Punjab police would communicate to the police in the proposed IFA locations that they are looking for the Appellants.45 This is a conclusion that is relevant to the motivation of the agents of persecution. I have already explained why I find that the RPD applied the correct standard of proof to findings of fact and the correct legal test to assessment of future risk. In explaining why the RPD's conclusion on motivation and the findings on which it was based are correct, I will address only other arguments made by the Appellants. In the reasons that follow, I explain why, on reviewing the record, I reach the same conclusion as the RPD. The evidence does not establish a serious possibility that the Punjab police would communicate to the police in the proposed IFA locations that they are looking for the Appellants.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Principal Appellant's arrest and detention was extra-judicial\n[21] The Appellants argue that the RPD was wrong to find that the Principal Appellant's arrest was extra-judicial and to rely on that conclusion in order to find that he does not face a serious possibility of persecution in an IFA location. I am not persuaded by their arguments. For the reasons that follow, I find that the Principal Appellant's arrest and detention was extra-judicial, on a balance of probabilities.\n[22] The Principal Appellant's evidence was that the police came to his shop on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, looking for BS. The Principal Appellant's evidence was that BS had helped him in the shop and he had helped BS find a place to live by giving the landlord a guarantee and by paying the rent. The Principal Appellant accompanied the police to BS's home, where they found pro-Khalistan posters and pamphlets. They took the Principal Appellant to the police station, where he was questioned about BS's activities and whereabouts, and tortured. He was photographed, fingerprinted, and made to sign blank sheets of paper. On XXXX XXXX, 2019, after his father paid a bribe, the Principal Appellant was released on condition that he report to the police when asked to do so and that he turn BS in to the police. The Principal Appellant was picked up by the police again, on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and questioned about BS's whereabouts. The Principal Appellant came to Canada in XXXX 2019. His evidence was that the police went to his home in XXXX 2019 and again in XXXX 2019 looking for him and that they threatened to arrest the Associate Appellant because of the Principal Appellant's failure to comply with the police conditions. The Associate Appellant and the Minor Appellant came to Canada in XXXX 2019.\n[23] Apart from the arguments that I have already addressed regarding standard of proof and the legal test, the Appellants do not challenge the panel's findings that the Appellants were never formally charged with anything, no First Information Report (FIR) was ever filed against them, no arrest warrant, summons, or other order was ever issued against them by the courts, police, or other authorities, and they were never presented before a magistrate or a medical officer, and I see no error in them. On an independent assessment, my findings are the same.\n[24] The Appellants argue that the Principal Appellant was arrested and brought to the police station, his photograph, fingerprints and signature on a blank page were taken, and that, therefore, there is a legal presumption that his arrest was recorded in the police station diary. They argue that the arrest was contrary to Indian protocol and procedures as well as international law but it was not extra-judicial. I am not persuaded by this argument. The Appellants cite objective evidence describing the daily diary or general diary as an account of the daily functioning of the police station. Their argument seems to be that there is a presumption that the police acted in accordance with this requirement. Even if I accept, for purposes of the analysis, that there is such a presumption, the evidence rebuts this presumption. There is objective evidence that the police flagrantly abuse the rights of people in custody46 and the Principal Appellant's evidence is that he was tortured while he was in custody. I find that this evidence rebuts any presumption that the police complied with procedural requirements, such as a requirement to make an entry in the police station diary.\n[25] I also reject the argument that the police merely failed to follow protocol and procedures. The Appellants refer to paragraphs 48 and 49 of the RPD's reasons as quoting extensively from the objective evidence in the NDP to show what Indian law prescribes in terms of police protocol and procedures. If the protocol and procedures are prescribed by Indian law, and I agree that they are, then failure to comply with them makes the arrest and detention contrary to Indian law or, in other words, illegal or extra-judicial. The objective evidence is that, even in the event of an arrest where no charges are laid, the police are required by law to document the arrest by preparing a memorandum, with the date and time of the arrest, that is signed by both the person arrested and a witness, such as a family member of the person arrested.47 Moreover, a person arrested without a warrant cannot legally be detained for more than 24 hours without being brought before a magistrate.48 The law also requires that a detainee be examined by a medical officer soon after their arrest.49\n[26] The Appellants also argue that the RPD quotes evidence on how the \"protocols\" are notoriously breached by police authorities in India. This is why the Principal Appellant's arrest and detention was illegal-the police did not act in accordance with the law. Despite legal safeguards for arrested persons, human rights violations by the police, including torture, are reportedly common, as is corruption.50 The Appellants go on to argue that the RPD did not explain how breach of protocol and procedure by police signifies the absence of a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellants. They argue that the RPD reasoned incorrectly from the premise that the Punjab police did not follow the protocol and procedures established by Indian law to conclude that the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFAs. I am not persuaded by their argument. The Appellants' argument rests on the supposition that \"protocols and procedures\" can be prescribed by law and, yet, failure to comply with them is not a violation of the law. I have explained why I do not agree. Secondly, I find that the Appellants' argument fails to acknowledge that the RPD explained the steps involved in the reasoning process that led the panel to find that there was not a serious possibility that the Punjab police would look for the Appellants in the IFA locations. The RPD made findings of fact and then considered whether, in light of those facts, there is a serious possibility that the Punjab police would look for the Appellants in the IFAs by communicating with police in the IFA locations. The panel found that there was not. The Appellants' argument obscures the chain of reasoning in the RPD's decision and challenges the RPD's final conclusion on the first prong of the IFA test, without acknowledging the specific findings of fact and the specific future risk assessment that underlie the conclusion. In these reasons, I explain why, on reviewing the record, I arrive at the same findings of fact and the same conclusion.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Punjab Police identified them as suspects in a case of \"major crimes\" or \"high profile organized crime.\"\n[27] Based on the unchallenged findings that I have mentioned in paragraph 23 of these reasons, the RPD found that the Appellants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Punjab Police identified them as suspects in a case of \"major crimes\" or \"high profile organized crime.\" The Appellants have not, apart from the argument that I have already addressed regarding standard of proof and the legal test, challenged this finding and I see no error in it. On an independent assessment, I reach the same conclusion. It was on the basis of this finding, that the RPD concluded that there was not a serious possibility that the Punjab police would communicate with the police in the IFAs that they are looking for the Appellants. I see no error in this and I reach the same conclusion, on an independent assessment.\nThe Appellants have not established that the Punjab police would be motivated to pursue the Principal Appellant because of his failure to comply with conditions\n[28] The Appellants argue that, in assessing motivation, the RPD did not consider the evidence that the Principal Appellant failed to fulfill the conditions of his release.51 I do not agree. The RPD referred to this evidence in finding that the Appellants failed to establish that the Punjab police identified them as suspects in a case of major crimes or high profile organized crime.52 The panel noted that, despite the evidence that the Principal Appellant absconded from the conditions of his release, there was no evidence that a summons or arrest warrant was issued. The Appellants argue that the Principal Appellant breached conditions imposed by the police in absconding and that absconding is a crime. I have considered whether the Principal Appellant's failure to respect the conditions orally communicated to him by the Punjab police is evidence that they would be motivated to locate him in the IFAs. I find that it does not establish a serious possibility that they would track him. The Appellants refer to a Federal Court decision which they argue ruled that failure to respect police conditions is a crime and it is an error not to consider that fact as giving police sufficient motivation to track a claimant in an IFA location.53 I do not agree with the Appellants' interpretation of that decision.\n[29] In Wijekoon Mudiyanselage, the claimant had been instructed by the local police to report to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division in the country's capital. He was given a deadline by which to report and he was instructed that the purpose of his reporting would be to lodge a corruption complaint against a member of Parliament who had awarded a contract to the claimant's sister's business. The Court referred to the failure to comply with police directions as a crime in itself. That finding was in reference to directions to report by a specific date for the purpose of an ongoing criminal investigation. The Court's reasons do not indicate whether the directions were issued in writing, which would establish that a process was being followed and that there would be documentary evidence on which to base a conviction for failure to comply with a condition. I have already explained why I find that the RPD correctly found that the Principal Appellant's arrest and detention was illegal. I find that the Principal Appellant's failure to abide by conditions communicated to him orally on his release from an illegal detention is not equivalent to non-compliance with conditions lawfully imposed. Moreover, the Federal Court did not say that failure to respect police conditions is evidence that establishes police motivation to track a claimant in an IFA location. What the Court said was that the RAD failed to consider the evidence of non-compliance with the conditions, along with other evidence relevant to the issue of motivation. Contrary to the Appellants' submission, the Court did not say that such evidence, in and of itself, establishes motivation under the first prong of the test for an IFA.\n[30] The Appellants argue that, because the Principal Appellant absconded, the forward-looking risk that he faces requires the Appellants to live in hiding, hoping that the police will not pursue him in an IFA location. They argue that the RPD failed to consider the context and repercussions of the Principal Appellant's absconding on the possibility that the Appellants could be traced through family members who are being harassed by the police. I am not persuaded by the Appellants' argument. I find no evidence that local police in India, including the Punjab police, track and pursue people throughout India because of a failure to comply with conditions that were imposed without lawful authority.\n[31] The onus is on the Appellants to establish that there is a serious possibility the Punjab police would track them in the IFA locations in order to persecute them. The evidence shows no more than a mere possibility that the Punjab police are motivated to locate the Appellants in an IFA.\nThe Appellants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution by local police in the IFAs\n[32] I have also considered the evidence that police keep track of or monitor Khalistan supporters in Punjab.54 The proposed IFAs are not in Punjab, therefore, I do not find that this is evidence of motivation by the Punjab police to pursue the Appellants outside Punjab. There is evidence that Sikhs who openly advocate for Khalistan outside Punjab may be at risk of harassment by the police, including false cases.55 There is no evidence that the Principal Appellant has openly advocated for Khalistan and he testified that it makes no difference to him whether Khalistan comes into existence or India stays the way it is.56 I find that there is no more than a mere possibility that the Principal Appellant's imputed political opinion would become known to police in the IFA locations, given that he is not an active supporter of Khalistan and that there is not a serious possibility that the Punjab police would communicate with police in the IFA locations.\nOther decisions by the RAD and the RPD are based on different facts\n[33] The Appellants refer, in their submissions, to two RAD decisions and one RPD decision involving claimants from India, which they have included in the Appellants' Record.57 In each of these decisions, the claimant alleged that he feared the Punjab police. In each case, the panel found that the claimant did not have an IFA because the police had the means and motivation to locate the claimant in the IFA.\n[34] The Appellants submit that these cases involve issues identical to the ones that arise in this appeal and that, in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in Vavilov,58 I must reach the same conclusions and that it would be incorrect for me to find that the Appellants have a viable IFA. I am not persuaded by this argument. To begin with, there are other decisions, by the RAD and by the RPD, finding that claimants from India who fear persecution by the Punjab police on the basis of political opinion, actual or imputed, have a viable IFA.59 My role is to decide this appeal on the basis of the evidence in the record. The Federal Court has said that each refugee claim, given that it arises out of uniquely personal circumstances, must be assessed in its particular context.60 The Court has also said that, where the evidence on an issue is mixed, decision-makers may reach opposite decisions that are equally reasonable.61 Different decision-makers may reach different outcomes, even in cases that may have similarities.62 Moreover, I find that there are factual differences between the decisions that the Appellants have included in their record and the circumstances in the Appellants' case. I find these differences significant in relation to the motivation of the Punjab police.\n[35] The Principal Appellant's evidence was that he fears the Punjab police would arrest him because they want to get information about BS, in particular, his whereabouts.63 He testified that he last saw BS on XXXX XXXX, 2019 and does not know where he is or anything about him after that date.64 The Principal Appellant's evidence was that the police want to find BS and, by leaving the country, the Principal Appellant violated his commitment to present himself to the police when asked to do so.65\n[36] In JSB, the appellant feared a former village Sarpanch who was a member of the BJP, the ruling political party, as well as the Punjab police. The RAD found that the police had three reasons to be interested in the appellant. Firstly, the police had acted in collaboration with the former Sarpanch, who was vindictive; secondly, because the police suspected the appellant of supporting militants; and, thirdly, because the appellant's brother was sought by the police, due to his political alliances, and was granted asylum in the United States. The RAD's finding that the police were motivated to locate the appellant in an IFA was based on these facts, which I find significantly different to those in the Appellants' case. Not only did the police have more than one reason for their interest in JSB, the reason they suspected him of supporting militants was that they found arms and ammunition in a car parked at his farm. In the Principal Appellant's case, his evidence is that the police interest in him is because they believe he knows the whereabouts of BS, in whose room they found posters and other printed material. Moreover, in JSB, the police had, in the past, acted in response to political pressure put on them by the village Sarpanch, for personal reasons.\n[37] In HSPK, the appellants had campaigned politically against the successful Congress Party in 2017 and were the victims of reprisals by the police. In 2018, the appellants demonstrated outside the police station, demanding the release of a prisoner, and were subsequently arrested and tortured. The male appellant had accused a police inspector of taking bribes and collaborating with an influential supporter of the Congress Party in a land dispute that was the context for the arrest of the prisoner. After the appellants left India, the police came looking for them, beat the male appellant's mother, and arrested and tortured his brother. These facts differ significantly from the facts in the Appellants' case. The evidence in HSPK was that the appellants had directly challenged the police for being corrupt and that, after the appellants left India, the police assaulted two of their family members. Although the evidence in this case is that the police visited the Appellants' family members, they did not physically abuse or arrest any of them. There is no evidence that the Principal Appellant has challenged the police publicly or complained about them. Their interest in him arose out of the assumption that he might know the whereabouts of BS.\n[38] In SS, the claimant had been questioned, arrested and detained twice, accused of involvement with Khalistani and Pakistani militants abroad, alleged to be complicit in political assassinations in Punjab, and beaten by the police; targeted by the CID, who had given instruction to local police to take action against him; and threatened with further beatings and being killed if he did not tell officers what they wanted to hear from him despite repeated denials on his part. The RPD found that the police remained motivated to find the claimant in an IFA location. I find these facts distinguishable from the facts in the Appellants' case. In particular, the evidence before the RPD in SS was that a superintendent with the Punjab police told the claimant that the local police were acting under orders from the State Police Services of India and they had little choice or influence in the matter. The seriousness of the allegations, including complicity in murders, and the involvement of national police services are significant differences that, in my view, explain why the police would be motivated to locate SS.\nThe RPD correctly found that relocation to New Delhi or Mumbai would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellants, on a balance of probabilities\n[39] The RPD found that the Appellants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that relocation to New Delhi or Mumbai would be objectively unreasonable for them, in their personal circumstances. The Appellants disagree with this finding but limit their submissions to the following:\nWithout any admissions with regards to the RPD Member's assessment of the\n\"Reasonableness\" prong, Appellant's submissions will focus on the \"Safety\" prong of the RPD decision.66\nAppellant submits that the Member's analysis is flawed on the \"Reasonableness\"\nand \"Safety\" prongs of the legal test in determining that the IFA locations proposed are viable.67\n[40] They specify the location of the errors in the RPD's reasons as paragraphs 15 to 100.68\n[41] In my view, the Appellants' memorandum does not meet the requirements of paragraph 3(3)(g) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules), which sets out the obligation to present full and detailed submissions regarding the errors made with references as to where those errors are located in the written reasons for the decision or in the transcript or in any audio. The absence of any particulars regarding errors in the RPD's assessment of the reasonableness of the IFAs is sufficient to reject the argument that the RPD erred. It remains my responsibility to conduct an independent assessment and to decide whether the RPD erred. This is what I have done. I find no error in the RPD's conclusion.\n[42] The RPD reviewed the evidence given by the Appellants about their personal circumstances, including their educational and employment backgrounds, their linguistic abilities, their religious and ethnic identity as Sikhs, and the reasons they gave for why they believe they could not relocate to the IFAs. The RPD reviewed the independent evidence in the NDP for India, in light of the Appellants' personal circumstances. On an independent assessment, I find that the Appellants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that relocation to New Delhi or Mumbai would be objectively unreasonable for them, in their particular circumstances. I reach this conclusion for the same reasons as given by the RPD in paragraphs 90 to 99 of the Reasons for Decision.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Minor Appellant's claim does not have an objective basis\n[43] The Appellants submit that, in light of their other submissions and the evidence in the record, the RPD's finding that the Minor Appellant's fear is not well-founded is unreasonable.69 That is the extent of their submission in respect of the RPD's finding on this issue. The Appellants' submission falls short of the requirements of RAD Rule 3(3)(g). I find no error in the RPD's assessment of the evidence and conclusion on this issue. On reviewing the record, I reach the same conclusion for the reasons given by the RPD in paragraphs 29 to 36 of the Reasons for Decision. I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish an objective basis for the Minor Appellant's fear. The Appellants have not established that the Minor Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution based on her membership in the particular social group, minor children of persons imputed to be supporters of Khalistan.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] For the reasons I have given, I find that the adult Appellants have viable IFAs in New Delhi and Mumbai and the Minor Appellant's claim does not have an objective basis. Accordingly, the Appellants have failed to establish that they face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in India.\n[45] I dismiss the appeal. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nC.

The appellant is challenging the RPD's analysis and is asking the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow the appeal or refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] After conducting an independent analysis of all the evidence on the record, including the recording of the hearing, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant has an IFA in Mexico. I therefore confirm the RPD's determination that the appellant did not establish that he is a refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[4] The appeal is dismissed.\nOVERVIEW\n[5] The appellant is a 49-year-old man who was living in the city of XXXX, Sinaloa. According to his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), he fears that he will be killed by members of the XXXX XXXX criminal group, who are responsible for the abduction and disappearance of his cousin in XXXX 2017.\n[6] The appellant alleges that on XXXX XXXX, 2017, while he was at his cousin's home in XXXX, armed and masked men arrived in a van without licence plates and spoke to his cousin. The next month, his cousin disappeared. The family learned that those responsible for the abduction were members of XXXX XXXX, the group that controlled the village of XXXX XXXX XXXX in the municipality of XXXX.\n[7] A few months later, the appellant's relatives informed him that people from XXXX XXXX were interested in him. His cousin's neighbour also informed him that people had appeared at his home asking for the appellant's address.\n[8] Fearing for his life, the appellant left Mexico for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018. He claimed refugee protection on August 21, 2020.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND REQUEST TO HOLD AN ORAL HEARING\n[9] The appellant cites two newspaper articles as new evidence that, in his opinion, establish the ability of the XXXX XXXX criminal group to locate him elsewhere in Mexico.\n[10] As explained below, I am of the opinion that the determinative issue in this appeal is the criminals' motivation to go after the appellant. Therefore, because the new evidence is not relevant to this issue, it is inadmissible on appeal.\n[11] Given that the RAD is not allowing new evidence on appeal, the request to hold an oral hearing is also denied under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[12] My role is to examine all the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct with respect to each error raised in the appellant's arguments.1\nANALYSIS2\nInternal flight alternative\nFirst prong - prospective risk not established\n[13] I am of the opinion that the appellant failed to establish that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subjected to a risk to his life, a danger of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to live in Campeche or Puebla.\n[14] The IFA analysis requires a contextual approach that considers the profile of the agents of persecution as well as their motivation and ability to track down the appellant across Mexico. A serious possibility of being persecuted, or a risk as defined in section 97 of the IRPA, can only be found if it is demonstrated that the agents of persecution have the \"probable means and motivation\" to search for the appellant.3\n[15] I am of the opinion that the determinative factor in this case is the lack of interest of the agents of harm in searching for the appellant across Mexico to harm him.\n[16] In this respect, the RPD concluded that the appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that his agents have the desire to pursue him in the IFA cities, for the following reasons:\n* The appellant continued to live at the same address and to carry out his regular activities for 10 months before leaving Mexico without being bothered by the criminal group responsible for his cousin's disappearance.\n* Despite the fact that his relatives confronted the XXXX XXXX group about his cousin's disappearance, none of them were threatened or assaulted by that group.\n* Although he alleges that men from that group asked people in his circle about him, the group's men did not go any further in their questioning. They did not conduct any further searches to find him in XXXX.\n* The appellant waited 10 months to leave the country even though he had a valid passport and Canada did not require a visa for Mexicans.\n* The appellant waited several years to claim refugee protection in Canada.\n* The appellant failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the theft reported by his wife on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022, was connected to the XXXX XXXX criminal group.\n[17] The appellant submits that he clearly explained that the reason for his persecution was related to the fact that he was the sole witness to the incident in which his cousin was threatened, and he was later murdered. That could result in the criminals being charged and detained.\n[18] Moreover, he states that the RPD erred in concluding that the theft his wife experienced on XXXX XXXX, 2022, was not related to the XXXX XXXX criminal group, as the thieves took only his wife's identity documents and the appellant's photograph.\n[19] I have considered the appellant's arguments, and I am of the opinion that it was not demonstrated, either in his testimony or in the objective documentary evidence, that his aggressors are truly motivated to pursue the appellant in the IFA cities.\n[20] First, like the RPD, I am of the opinion that although the appellant witnessed the meeting between the cartel and his cousin, he was not threatened or harmed before leaving the country, even though he continued to live at the same address for 10 months.\n[21] Although the cartel members went around the neighbourhood and to his aunt and asked questions to find out where the appellant lived, their efforts stopped there. They never approached the appellant (who lived only an XXXX and a XXXX away), nor did they threaten his relatives in order to track down the appellant either after his cousin's disappearance in XXXX 2017 or since the appellant left the country in XXXX 2018, even though the family had started to look into his cousin's disappearance. As the Federal Court states, \"This absence of evidence is an element that can reasonably support a finding of a lack of ongoing interest in pursuing the applicant and therefore a finding of an IFA.\"4\n[22] According to Tab 7.15 of the National Documentation Package, cartels use family networks to track down or intimidate their victims when they are unable to locate them.5 Tab 7.8 states that the criminals \"abduct and torture\" relatives to track down or intimidate their victims.6 The Federal Court has also confirmed that it is logical to argue that if the gang had truly intended to find the applicant, one of the first places it would have gone to would have been to his family's home.7\n[23] I am of the opinion that if the criminal group truly intended to target the appellant because he had witnessed their meeting with his cousin, it could have done so in the 10 months before he left Mexico. Moreover, I note that the appellant was not the only person to identify his cousin's assailants as members of XXXX XXXX; his cousin's family had also learned that it was that group during their searches. In that respect, I note that none of his relatives suffered any harm despite the fact that they confronted the cartel about his cousin's disappearance.\n[24] I consider that even if the XXXX XXXX group had the ability to track someone across Mexico, according to the objective evidence, moving to another part of the country may be enough to avoid the risk of harm if the conflict is not too serious:\n... it is an oversimplification to say that a group will track just anyone. It really depends on who you are and what you did. Low ranking members are not worth the time or resources for armed groups to track and kill. Instead, high-ranking members or someone who betrayed a [high-ranking member of] a criminal organization may cause you to be tracked or targeted.\n...\n... the safety of an individual who relocates to flee from one of these organizations' threats depends on the interests a group may have to punish or retaliate against them. If the conflict is not too serious, a relocation might work.8 [Emphasis added]\n[25] Tab 7.8 states that \"criminal groups are motivated to track certain individuals because they steal or lose money; due to personal rivalries; for political incentives\/reasons;...or due to 'personal vengeance; perceived betrayal; public exposition of relationships with public officials, politicians or investments; or cooperation with authorities as informants or collaborative witnesses'.\"9 Again, according to the documentary evidence, it would be reasonable to have concerns if the criminal group had a \"very strong\" motivation to find the person.10\n[26] I note that neither the appellant nor his relatives reported the cartel to the police and the appellant never cooperated with the authorities as an informant or witness. The appellant testified that his family ceased all efforts to find his cousin when the group told them that they would have problems if they continued their search. Therefore, the appellant has not established that he is a particular \"enemy\" of the cartel, which would make him the subject of ongoing interest after his departure from the region.11 The evidence simply does not show that the agents of harm truly intend to search for the appellant across Mexico because he witnessed the meeting between the masked men and his cousin.\n[27] I agree with the RPD that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the break-in of his wife's car-three years later, in XXXX 2022, while she was in the city of XXXX-was connected to the criminals feared by the appellant, even though, according to the letter submitted in evidence, his wife [translation] \"suspected\" that it was them because the thieves took only her identity documents and a photograph of the appellant. In the absence of additional evidence to establish that the criminals intended to go after the appellant before or after that incident, I cannot conclude that this theft was connected to him.\n[28] Therefore, I conclude that the appellant did not establish that he would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution or to one of the risks set out in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA by members of the XXXX XXXX cartel in Puebla or Campeche.\nDelay in leaving Mexico and delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada\n[29] I agree with the RPD that the 10-month delay in leaving Mexico, when he had a valid passport and did not require a visa, and the two-year delay before claiming refugee protection in Canada (opting instead to renew his residence permit) support the conclusion that the appellant did not establish that he would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution or to one of the risks set out in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA by members of the XXXX XXXX cartel in Puebla or Campeche. The appellant did not challenge that conclusion by the RPD, which I consider to be correct.\nSecond prong - relocation to the IFA cities is not unreasonable\n[30] The RPD noted that aside from his fear of the XXXX XXXX group, the appellant stated that he did not see any barriers to relocating to Campeche or Puebla.\n[31] The RPD then analyzed the appellant's profile-his level of education, his diverse work experience and his resourcefulness-in light of the objective evidence and the relatively peaceful conditions in the IFA cities and concluded that it would not be objectively unreasonable for him to relocate to Campeche or Puebla. The appellant did not challenge that conclusion, which I consider to be correct.\n[32] I conclude that the appellant has a viable IFA in Campeche and Puebla. The RPD did not err in that regard.\nCONCLUSION\n[33] Under paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, I confirm the RPD's determination that the appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, did not establish that he is a refugee or a person in need of protection under sections 96 or 97 of the IRPA.\n[34] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed by)\nB.

She is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting her refugee protection claim.\n[2] Ms. XXXX XXXX fears persecution from her husband in Mexico. She survived an abusive relationship with this man for over twenty years and fled the domestic violence in 2015. She alleges that her husband continued to harass her and went to her house in 2019, attempting to attack her. She left her house after this incident and came to Canada shortly after.\n[3] The RPD found that Ms. XXXX XXXXwas credible about being in an abusive relationship up to the time she separated from her husband in 2015, but not about any subsequent incidents with her husband, based on omissions in her evidence as well as vague and inconsistent testimony about what happened in 2019. The RPD concluded that, based on her profile as a single woman, she could return safely to Mexico.\n[4] Ms. XXXX XXXXargues that the RPD erred in assessing the credibility of her allegations of her husband's continued violence after 2015, mainly by failing to consider her profile as a vulnerable victim of domestic violence. She submits that the RPD should have considered her past trauma when assessing the quality of her testimony. She also argues that the RPD should have applied the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board (Guideline on Gender Considerations) when analyzing her memory problems.\n[5] I allow this appeal and I am referring the claim back to a differently constituted RPD panel for redetermination.1\nANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\nChairperson's Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations2\n[6] The Chairperson's Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations must be considered in appropriate cases. It is incumbent on Immigration and Refugee Board decision-makers to exhibit the knowledge required and to apply it in an understanding, fulsome and sensitive manner when deciding issues relating to individuals fearing gender-related persecution.\n[7] The RPD member stated that he considered the Guideline on Gender Considerations during the hearing and in his assessment of whether Ms. XXXX XXXX, as a survivor of domestic violence prior to her separation in 2015, had a profile as a single woman that could sustain her refugee protection claim.\n[8] Ms. XXXX XXXXargues that the RPD did not properly consider the Gender Guideline when assessing the quality of her testimony and her profile as a vulnerable survivor of domestic violence.\n[9] In my analysis of the testimony and the evidence on the record, I also took into account the Guideline on Gender Considerations and the fact that Ms. XXXX XXXXis a survivor of long-term domestic violence and abuse. I agree with Ms. XXXX XXXXthat the RPD erred by not assessing her allegations and testimony through the lens of the Guideline on Gender Considerations and that this error tainted the assessment of her credibility.\nStandard of review\n[10] When reviewing the RPD decision, I am required to independently assess all the evidence and determine whether the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error. I may defer to the RPD in the exceptional situation that I find it had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances, and reasons will be provided in that situation.3 To be clear, this is not the situation in this case.\n[11] After conducting my own analysis of the evidence on the record, including reading a transcript of the RPD hearing, I agree with Ms. XXXX XXXXthat the RPD made errors in analyzing her credibility by not properly applying the Guideline on Gender Considerations.\nCredibility\n[12] The RPD found that Ms. XXXX XXXXhad not credibly established that her husband continued to approach and harass her after she left him in 2015 because:\n* Her testimony on all the post-2015 allegations was vague and inconsistent with the written account in her Basis of Claim Form.\n* Specifically, in her written account, Ms. XXXX XXXXfails to mention that she had gone to live with her parents after leaving her husband, that her husband had been to their house between 2015 and 2019 and that he had made threats and insulted her father. She testified about this during the hearing, but these allegations are absent from her written account. She explained that she had forgotten to mention this, but the RPD found this explanation unreasonable.\n* There were inconsistencies between the description in Ms. XXXX XXXXwritten account and her testimony about the incident in 2019 when her husband went to her house, which was the incident that prompted her to flee the country. One inconsistency was whether she fled at night or in the morning, another was whether her husband went once or twice to the house, and finally another was whether he was armed with a machete. She explained that she is sometimes confused but the RPD found her testimony murky.\n[13] Ms. XXXX XXXXargues that the RPD erred in the above-mentioned credibility assessment as it did not consider her profile as a vulnerable survivor of domestic violence and how the trauma of her history of abuse might affect her memory and the quality of her testimony. She submits that the RPD did not properly consider the Guideline on Gender Considerations with respect to her memory problems and the quality of her testimony.\n[14] Ms. XXXX XXXXalso argues that the RPD focused on secondary inconsistencies and that it is understandable that after all the abuse she suffered over the years that she would forget or confuse certain details, adding that she does not have a high level of education.\n[15] Finally, Ms. XXXX XXXXpoints to a bit of confusion that occurred at the beginning of the hearing about whether or not the RPD had received her amended written account and argues that this added to her nervousness and lack of clarity during the hearing.\n[16] In my opinion, Ms. XXXX XXXXis correct to argue that the RPD erred in assessing her credibility. The RPD did not apply the Guideline on Gender Considerations with respect to her allegations and testimony before the RPD. Sections 7.5 and 7.6 of the Guideline on Gender Considerations are clear about how trauma can affect a person's memory and as a result, the quality of their testimony.4 I find that this error negatively affected the RPD's assessment of her credibility. More specifically, the RPD erred by failing to consider the how the trauma of being a survivor of years of domestic violence may have impacted her. I find that it is logical to conclude that her testimony before the RPD was affected by her vulnerability based on her past trauma.\n[17] As a result, I am not satisfied with the RPD's credibility assessment and find that it was incorrect, but also insufficient, to conclude that Ms. XXXX XXXXwas not credible about the harassment and threats she endured from her husband after she left him in 2015. I would add that at this point, the application of the Guideline on Gender Considerations becomes even more important for the assessment of this claim.\nProfile of a single woman\n[18] The RPD found that even after considering the Guideline on Gender Considerations, Ms. XXXX XXXXprofile as a single woman was not enough to sustain her claim and that she could safely return to Mexico.\n[19] Ms. XXXX XXXXargues that the RPD should have considered her not only a single woman, but also a vulnerable single woman with a history of trauma returning to Mexico.\n[20] Once again, I agree with Ms. XXXX XXXXthat the RPD erred in its assessment of her profile and did not fully engage with what she endured and the life she lived due to her violent husband.\n[21] With this in mind, the problem in my view is that not enough questions were put to Ms. XXXX XXXXabout her prospective risk, based on her profile as a vulnerable survivor of long-term abuse and, more specifically, about the adequacy of state protection and the possibility of an internal flight alternative (IFA).\n[22] These two issues were addressed briefly during the hearing: Ms. XXXX XXXXstated that she filed a complaint once with the police, but that they did not do anything other than discuss the situation merely as a family matter, when asked whether she could settle in Mexico City. She replied that her husband had people looking for her, without elaborating. In my opinion, there is not enough evidence on these two issues for me to form a proper conclusion, and I believe she deserves a chance to elaborate on these issues in a full hearing of these matters.\n[23] While I consider that the RPD decision must be set aside because of errors referred to above in the credibility assessment, I cannot draw my own conclusions as to whether Ms. XXXX XXXXis a refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[24] I cannot substitute my own decision for that of the RPD without hearing the testimony given before the RPD. Therefore, the case should be referred back to the RPD.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] I allow this appeal and am referring the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXXback to a differently constituted RPD panel for redetermination.5\nDIRECTIONS\n[26] Further questions must be put to Ms. XXXX XXXXabout her prospective risk, including the adequacy of state protection and the possibility of an IFA elsewhere in Mexico, away from the area where her husband lives.\n(signed)\nJulie Corry\nMember's name\nJune 15, 2023\nDate of amended decision\nMay 11, 2023\nDate of original decision\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended (IRPA), paragraph 111(1)(c).\n2 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, effective November 13, 1996, revised in July 2022.

XXXX XXXX (Appellant), a citizen of Rwanda, appeals the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (\"RPD\"), dated September 16, 2022, rejecting her claim for refugee protection under either section 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\"IRPA\").1\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. I find that the RPD did not err in its decision that the Appellant is neither a Convention2 refugee nor a person in need of protection. I further find that the determinative factor regarding the application of both section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA is credibility. I therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.3\nOVERVIEW\n[3] The Appellant alleges she fears persecution in Rwanda due to her sexual orientation as a lesbian. The Appellant claimed in her Basis of Claim (BOC) that she had had feelings for a fellow student, XXXX, while in XXXX XXXX, that her father discovered this when she and her friend were expelled and that, thereafter, the Appellant was subjected to a series of church-organized \"prayer therapies\" designed to eradicate her sexual orientation. The Appellant also alleged that during one of these sessions she was sexually assaulted by several pastors. Following an arrest and overnight detention, the Appellant's mother arranged for her to study in Halifax, where her two siblings had been students for several years; the Appellant acquired a passport in XXXX 2019, and a Canadian student visa was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2019. Nine weeks later, the Appellant left Rwanda and came to Canada where she stayed with her sister before finding an apartment in Halifax. Her student visa expired on the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021. The Appellant made her refugee claim on June 9, 2021. In an amendment to her BOC (\"Updates about my view about my body and transitioning\")4, the Appellant indicated that if she had been born with a male body she would be \"perfect\" and that she wants to explore the possibility of transitioning. She claims that she is not safe anywhere in Rwanda.\n[4] A hearing was held, in two sittings, on June 21, 2022 and July 19, 2022. The RPD reserved and issued its reasons on September 16, 2022, making the following findings:\na) Given her lack of knowledge, the timing of the alleged appointment, and the lack of evidence submitted, the Appellant has not established that she was truly seeking guidance on gender transitions;\nb) Given various contradictions and omissions about her gender identity, the Appellant has not established she is transgender or has been questioning her gender identity from a young age;\nc) Contradictions and omissions regarding her sexual orientation undermined her credibility;\nd) Given the major contradiction between the sister's testimony and her own letter, Panel gave the Appellant's sister's letter no probative value;\ne) Sister's testimony regarding their family life (and when she learned about the Appellant's sexual orientation) also undermined Appellant's credibility about her relationship with her parents, and how she was allegedly mistreated because of her sexual orientation;\nf) Contradiction and vague testimony regarding Appellant's relationship with XXXX;\ng) Contradictions regarding her membership in Horizon Community Association (HOCA) and friendship with XXXX;\nh) Failed to establish that she attended meetings with members or leaders of HOCA, and maintained a friendship with a HOCA leader;\ni) Has not established that she was beaten by her father because of her sexual orientation;\nj) Given that medical report contradicts her own testimony, Panel gives it no probative value;\nk) Omissions and contradictions regarding treatment by the police;\nl) Given the irregularities and that the existence of a summons was entirely omitted from her original narrative, Panel assigns this document no probative value;\nm) Has not provided a reasonable explanation for the 18-month delay in claiming refugee status, behaviour is inconsistent with her stated fear of returning to her country;\nn) Has not established that she was sexually assaulted by a pastor and two men at the church; and\no) The evidence appellant did submit does not establish that she attempted to date women, as she alleged.\n[5] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in the following findings:\na) RPD's credibility assessment was unreasonable and the RPD's decision as a whole is tainted by a reasonable apprehension of bias;\nb) Completely disregarded the Guidelines and was entirely unresponsive to the complexities of Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE) claims and engaged in improper stereotyping and made a veiled plausibility finding to discredit the Appellant's claims of gender identity confusion;\nc) Appellant never stated that she was considering gender reassignment surgery;\nd) RPD engaged in a crudely reductive and insensitive assessment of the Appellant's gender confusion and the RPD's conclusions regarding the Appellant's gender identity were entirely wrongful and inappropriate;\ne) Engaged in a selective review of the Appellant's evidence, ignored and mischaracterized her testimony;\nf) Disregarded the Gender Guidelines in its dismissal of the Appellant's allegations that she was sexually assaulted, improperly concluding that a \"legitimate\" survivor of sexual assault would be able to discuss that assault three years later, making several additional veiled plausibility findings without proper justification and conducted a selective review of the evidence;\ng) Entirely within the realm of what could reasonably be expected for the Appellant to view her relationship with her parents as strained, but for her sister to claim that the Appellant still had it better than the other siblings, was a peripheral issue;\nh) Made a veiled plausibility finding by importing a Western perspective on romantic relationships to the case at hand;\ni) RPD made an unreasonable finding of vagueness without considering the Guidelines, giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias;\nj) Engaged in a very selective analysis of the Appellant's evidence, this selective analysis is particularly egregious because the RPD faulted the Appellant for not providing examples, but never asked for examples;\nk) RPD made clear and obvious misstatements of the evidence before it;\nl) Unreasonably assumed that Appellant would have followed a typical linear North American \"coming out narrative,\"5 in contravention of the Guidelines; and\nm) RPD assessed the letters in evidence based on what they did not say, rather than what they did say, this was unreasonable and constituted another veiled plausibility finding.\n[6] The Appellant is not disclosing any new evidence nor is she requesting an oral hearing.\nTHE ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[7] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.6\nANALYSIS\n[8] In reviewing this appeal, I have been informed by and have applied two of the Chairperson's Guidelines: Guideline 4 - Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board,7 and Guideline 9 - Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics8 in my assessment of the evidence and the Appellant's testimony (SOGIESC).\nCredibility\n[9] The RPD found the Appellant's credibility undermined by a series of contradictions, inconsistencies, discrepancies and omissions.\nContradictions regarding the beatings by the Appellant's father and the medical report\n[10] I find the discrepancies between the Appellant's testimony, allegations and evidence undermine her credibility. The Appellant alleged in her original BOC that, sometime in XXXX or XXXX 2018-in the presence of her mother, who did not stop him-her father beat her severely and that thereafter she called her friend, XXXX, who took her to the hospital where she had to stay for three days because her shoulder blade was injured and her right arm was broken and was placed in a cast. In support of her allegations regarding the beating, she disclosed a medical report, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, from the hospital to which she alleged her friend XXXX had taken her. In her first BOC amendment, the Appellant alleged that she had previously used the wrong word and that a cast had not been used but a wrapping bandage. In her second BOC amendment, she alleged that she was beaten by two strangers in addition to her father, and in a secluded area, where she was abandoned afterwards. She also alleged for the first time, in her second amended BOC, that her father had-on a different occasion in 2019-injured her shoulder by twisting a knife point into it, causing a scar, of which she provided evidence in the form of a photograph. At the hearing, the Appellant was asked why she omitted the allegations regarding being beaten by several men from her original BOC. Regarding the beating, she said she wrote \"severely\" but meant \"severally\"-to refer to the fact that there were several people beating her. The RPD also asked her why the medical report did not say that she had broken her arm or injured her shoulder blade but only stated she had lacerations; the Appellant testified that she had no explanation. The RPD gave the medical report no probative value and found that-in addition to the fact that severally does not mean 'by several persons'-there were numerous discrepancies which the Appellant had not been able to satisfactorily explain which undermined her credibility. The Appellant has not challenged the RPD's findings.\n[11] I have independently reviewed the record before me. I do not accept as reasonable the Appellant's explanation regarding the discrepancy between her original BOC (where she alleged that her father, alone, beat her) and her amended BOC and testimony-where she alleged and testified that her parents and two other strange men had driven her out into a dark and secluded place where they beat and abandoned her. First, the Appellant testified at the June 21, 2022 sitting that her father had organized this beating of the Appellant by two other men and that their purpose had been to leave her there to die because of her sexual orientation. This account is materially different from the original BOC-where the Appellant alleged that her father became enraged with her, saying that XXXX family had complained to him about the Appellant and XXXX uncle had sabotaged his business, which was now failing, so her father blamed the Appellant and so beat her. This is not a discrepancy that can be explained by a linguistic mistake between \"severely and severally.\" Second, the injuries which the Appellant testified she sustained in the course of this beating by three men are materially different from those contained in the medical report. She testified that they kicked her and beat her in the ribs to the point where she was not breathing well. She was in such profound pain when she reached the hospital she could barely move or breathe. The Appellant testified that her arm was broken. The medical report, however, describes no bruising, no breaking of an arm or injuring of a shoulder blade, but lacerations-cuts, for which antibiotics were prescribed. I find these discrepancies have not been satisfactorily explained by the Appellant and I find they undermine her credibility. I find the Appellant has not established that she was assaulted by her father, either alone or with other men.\nContradictions and discrepancies in the Appellant's claims regarding her sexual orientation\n[12] I find the Appellant's credibility undermined by several contradictions, omissions and discrepancies in her evidence and testimony. The RPD found that various contradictions between her original BOC and her evidence and testimony regarding her sexual orientation undermined her credibility. On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred by focusing on peripheral issues and by importing Western ideation to evaluate the Appellant's \"coming out story.\" I have independently reviewed the record before me.\nContradictions between the sister's testimony and her letter\n[13] The Appellant's sister, XXXX, a student in Halifax since XXXX 2015, disclosed a letter and testified in support of her sister's claim. In her letter, XXXX stated that she first learned of the Appellant's sexual orientation in 2015, shortly after arriving in Halifax, when both of their parents telephoned her. In her testimony, however, although XXXX initially testified she learned of the Appellant's sexual orientation \"a few months before she came,\" (the Appellant arrived in XXXX 2020) XXXX quickly corrected herself and testified that she had learned of the Appellant's sexual orientation in 2018, when her mother, alone, telephoned her.9 Given the major contradiction between the sister's testimony and the sister's own letter, the RPD gave the Appellant's sister's letter no probative value. The Appellant argues that the RPD assumed a Western, linear, coming-out narrative and, moreover, selectively reviewed the Appellant's evidence to the point of raising a reasonable apprehension of bias. Having reviewed the record independently, I find that the Appellant's sister, XXXX, having provided in testimony, three different years in which she first learned of the Appellant's sexual orientation (2015, 2018 and 2020)-and having contradicted her own letter as to who told her (both parents, mother only)-is not a credible witness regarding when, and from whom, she learned of the Appellant's sexual orientation.\n[14] The Appellant's sister XXXX also provided testimony regarding their family life at home in Rwanda that the RPD found was sharply different from that described by the Appellant. The Appellant had described in her BOCs, and in her testimony, not only beatings by both of her parents but also one particular beating where both of her parents and two strangers had taken her to a dark secluded place where the two strangers and her father proceeded to severely beat her to the point where her arm was broken and her shoulder blade injured, abandoning her at the conclusion, leaving her to find her way back to town. The RPD found that XXXX testimony of the Appellant as being the spoiled and petted baby of the family contradicted the dark picture of family life painted by the Appellant to the point where the RPD found the contradiction undermined the Appellant's credibility about her relationship with her parents, and how she was allegedly mistreated because of her sexual orientation, allegations which the RPD stated, were at the heart of her claim. On appeal, the Appellant argues that the sister's recollection of the state of the family life was a peripheral issue, the RPD engaged in a veiled plausibility finding, selectively analyzed the evidence to the point of raising a reasonable apprehension of bias and that, in any event, the RPD improperly disregarded the evidence given by XXXX that the current state of relations between the Appellant and their parents was strained and essentially broken and had been since they discovered the Appellant's sexual orientation. I find the sister's depiction of the home life of their family to not be a material issue with respect to the Appellant's sexual orientation.\nContradictions in when and how the Appellant's parents learned of her sexual orientation\n[15] I find the Appellant's contradictions regarding when and how her parents learned of her sexual orientation undermine her credibility. The RPD found that the Appellant gave divergent accounts of when her parents learned of her sexual orientation, was not able to reasonably explain the contradictions and that this undermined her credibility. The Appellant argues on appeal that the accounts are not mutually exclusive, and that the RPD employed a North American \"coming out\" narrative view in analyzing the Appellant's stories. I have independently reviewed the record before me. At the first, June 21, 2022 hearing, the Appellant testified that she was 10 or 11 when she first began to have feelings towards girls and informed her mother.10 At the July 19, 2022 sitting, the Appellant initially testified that she was 13 or 14 when she first told her mother and that this had been in 2015.11 The RPD then asked the Appellant to explain her contradicting her prior testimony that she had told her mother when she was 10 or 11. The Appellant then calculated how old she would have been in 2015 (which she testified she knew for a certainty was the year in which she told her mother) and testified that she would have been 12. The Appellant then testified that, having told her mother about her sexual orientation in 2015, her mother immediately informed her father and also began taking her to praying therapies at their local church.\nMEMBER: So, was that right after you had told her about your feelings toward XXXX?\nCLAIMANT: Yes, that is when the therapy started and they discussed it about with my father and everything, I started having those therapies every single Sundays and Wednesdays.12\nThe RPD then asked the Appellant to explain how she had alleged in her BOC that the praying therapies had begun when she was-not 12-but 14 or 15. The Appellant then testified that what she had meant was that the therapies began before she was 14 or 15 but that they then increased in frequency to twice a week. When asked by the RPD why she had not included this in her BOC, the Appellant replied that she had not remembered, that had she been comfortable, she would have been able to recall fully and include this in her BOC.\n[16] I do not accept this explanation as reasonable for the following reasons. First, the Appellant alleged in her BOC that her father was the first parent to learn of her sexual orientation and he learned this in early 2018 when the Appellant and XXXX were expelled from school. This is a significant divergence from the Appellant's testimony on three different points: when her parents learned, how her parents learned and which parent learned first. This contradiction cannot be explained by the Appellant's argument that the RPD improperly employed a Western lens of a \"North American coming out narrative\" and thereby either misinterpreted or showed bias. The Appellant's BOC gave a detailed description of her father's reaction at first learning of her orientation from the school in 2018 and how he had to persuade the school to allow her to return to sit her graduating exam. This is a wholly differing account from the Appellant's telling her mother in 2015 at the time she first started having feelings, at the age of 12, for XXXX. Second, the Appellant also alleged in her BOC-not that her mother reacted to learning of her orientation by taking her to church to have people pray over her-but that \"my mom would bring pastors to our home to pray over me.\"13 I do not accept as reasonable the Appellant's proffered explanation for the discrepancies that there were so many things to put down in her BOC that she could not recall them all and that she had not been comfortable when she set down her BOC. I do not accept the Appellant's argument on appeal, that the Appellant might have told her mother when she was younger that she had feelings for XXXX but that her mother could have brushed this aside until 2018 when she took the Appellant's story more seriously and therefore the Appellant really came out to her mother twice. I do not accept that argument simply because it is entirely different from the Appellant's actual allegations and testimony and I find it is an attempt to retroactively re-interpret a divergence so as to reconcile different accounts into one cohesive narrative. I find the two narratives between BOC and testimony to be so widely divergent-and on so many points-that this explanation of two coming outs is not credible. I therefore find the Appellant's contradictions regarding when and how her parents learned of her sexual orientation undermine her credibility.\n[17] I find these cumulative contradictions-both in the evidence and testimony of the Appellant's sister XXXX, and regarding when and how her parents learned of her sexual orientation from the Appellant herself-undermine the Appellant's credibility regarding her sexual orientation.\nThe Appellant's account of her relationship with XXXX\n[18] I find the Appellant's account of her alleged relationship with XXXX was vague, lacking in detail and that the Appellant has not established that she was in a romantic relationship with XXXX. The RPD found that the Appellant's testimony regarding her relationship with XXXX was very vague and often contradictory and that this undermined the Appellant's credibility as to her relationship with XXXX and thus also undermined the Appellant's allegations of being persecuted because of their relationship and her sexual orientation. The Appellant argues that the RPD made veiled plausibility findings regarding the Appellant's relationship with XXXX when the RPD found: 1) it was \"incongruous\" that the two would not have discussed their having been expelled for having been discovered together, once they had been re-admitted to school, 2) the Appellant's scant knowledge of XXXX parents' feelings about their daughter's orientation unlikely,\n3) drawing a negative inference from the Appellant's not specifying a particular \"special\" memory of time with XXXX, 4) finding that had the Appellant truly been in a relationship with XXXX she would have attempted to solicit a letter of support from her. The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred in making a finding regarding what it saw as a discrepancy in when their relationship began, when the RPD had not canvassed this issue with the Appellant at the hearing and asked her to explain.\n[19] I find that the Appellant's recollection of her relationship with XXXX was undermined by vagueness. The SOGIESC Guideline indicates that testimony about same-sex relationships that is vague and lacking in detail may support a negative credibility inference.14 However the same guideline also cautions decision-makers to examine whether there are cultural, psychological or other barriers that may explain the manner in which the testimony is delivered and to be specific as to why they find the testimony vague. I find that, in the context of the hearing, with the Appellant's having lived in Canada for the last two years and having siblings who have lived here much longer, there are no cultural or psychological barriers preventing the Appellant from providing testimony that is not vague. Having reviewed the transcript of the hearing, I find that the Appellant did not offer spontaneous anecdotes or refer to specific things, experiences or thoughts she and XXXX shared over the course of their relationship, other than the one kiss in the shower to which she had already referred. The Appellant's testimony lacked detail about XXXX character or personality beyond saying that XXXX was kind and patient-but failed to provide any examples of what she was patient about or an example of how XXXX was kind to the Appellant or to a third party. The Appellant did not provide any details about anything else she liked about XXXX beyond her generally being a kind and patient person. The Appellant was unable to describe how the relationship evolved or failed to evolve. The Appellant was unable to provide any testimony about any special moments she shared with XXXX (beyond the one kiss in the shower she had already described). I find therefore, that the RPD did not err in its assessment of the Appellant's account of her relationship with XXXX. For all these reasons, I find that the Appellant has not established that she was in a romantic relationship with XXXX and that this inconsistency undermines her credibility.\nAttempts to date women since coming to Canada\n[20] I find the Appellant has not established that she ever attempted to date women since coming to Canada. The RPD found that the allegations made by the Appellant that she had attempted to meet other lesbians through the dating app Tinder, had not been established and found that the lack of evidence to support her allegations further eroded her credibility regarding her sexual orientation. The Appellant argues that the RPD made a veiled plausibility finding that the Appellant had not made a serious attempt to date other women since coming to Canada because she did not use her own photograph on Tinder. I have reviewed the record before me. The Appellant alleged in her amended BOC that she had downloaded the Tinder app but had asked a new acquaintance if she could use her photograph instead of the Appellant's. The Appellant alleges she later changed her Tinder profile to include her own photograph, but, having felt uncomfortable, deleted her profile entirely and was unable to retrieve it to establish that she had attempted to meet other women through Tinder. In support of her allegations, the Appellant disclosed a letter, accompanied by photo identification, of D, which stated that D had allowed the Appellant to deploy D's photo on Tinder without knowing the Appellant was going to use it to meet other women. The RPD found that the Appellant's narrative-that she used another woman's photograph because she felt insecure about her own body-did not make sense given the whole purpose of Tinder and gave D's letter little weight. I, too, give the letter from D little weight but for a different reason: I find that the use of Tinder does not assist in establishing sexual orientation as she never ultimately used it to go on dates with women.\n[21] I also do not find the Appellant has established that she tried to use Tinder to meet other women for the following reasons. First, the Appellant was unable to answer the RPD when asked at the hearing whether she had made any attempt to recover her Tinder profile to use as evidence. Second, the Appellant testified that she has used no other means of trying to meet other women in the two years since she came to Canada, even though she testified that she is aware of other resources that support LGBTQ persons in Halifax. When asked to explain why she had not, the Appellant's testimony evolved. First, she said she did not feel comfortable attending meetings until she became a more understanding person. Then she testified that she believed that she would be compelled to divulge everything about her past to the LGBTQ group. I do not find this a reasonable explanation; the Appellant did not explain why she was under the impression that she would be forced to tell everything about her past to the LGBTQ group. Moreover, the Appellant has now lived in Halifax for over two years and has two siblings who have lived in Halifax for far longer. Indeed, her sister testified that she has acquired a good deal of understanding of the LGBT community in Halifax.15 Given this knowledge of Canada and, specifically of the LGBT community in Halifax, I do not find it reasonable that the Appellant believed that she would be forced to recount her life story to an LGBTQ group. I find, for all the above reasons, that the Appellant has not established that she has attempted to date women since coming to Canada.\nContradictions regarding her participation in Horizon and Community Group (HOCA groups)\n[22] I find that the Appellant has not established that she participated in HOCA. The Appellant alleged in her BOC that she had been introduced to the HOCA group-an LGBTQ support group-by XXXX and that she \"went to a couple of meetings.\"16 The Appellant also alleged that she developed a friendship with XXXX-the leader of the local HOCA group and that she had not only received moral support from XXXX, but that when she had been beaten, XXXX drove her to the hospital and that the Appellant stayed with XXXX at her house from time to time. In support of her allegations of friendship with XXXX, the Appellant disclosed a letter from XXXX. The RPD, however, found that, on the balance of probabilities, the Appellant had never been involved with HOCA: a) partly because of discrepancies between XXXX letter and the Appellant's BOC and testimony regarding when they had last seen each other, b) partly because XXXX had not written her letter on HOCA letterhead, and c) partly because the letter XXXX did write was-unlike the other letters disclosed by the Appellant-not accompanied by photo identification. The RPD found the cumulative discrepancies undermined the Appellant's allegations that she had been involved in any way with HOCA or XXXX. The Appellant argues that the RPD is making a veiled plausibility finding, that it is not reasonable for a secret LGBTQ organization to have-let alone write letters on-letterhead, and that XXXX letter substantiates the Appellant's testimony, that as she was reticent about declaring herself to be a lesbian (even in a meeting of persons who identified as LGBTQ) although she may not have gone to general meetings, she did meet with some HOCA leaders including XXXX and thus participated in HOCA.\n[23] I have independently reviewed the record before me. Although I agree with the Appellant's argument, and find that it is not reasonable to expect a secret LGBTQ support group such as HOCA to have letterhead or expect one of its leaders to write letters on behalf of members on letterhead, I nonetheless find the discrepancy between XXXX letter and the Appellant's BOC regarding when they last saw each other, undermines the Appellant allegations that she was friends with XXXX and participated-even tangentially-with HOCA. Moreover, I give XXXX letter little weight because events it describes are materially different from both the Appellant's BOC and her testimony. Specifically, XXXX letter states that she last saw the Appellant in 2019 when she told the Appellant to escape from her house through a window. The Appellant's BOC stated that, even after this incident where she escaped through the window, she stayed at XXXX house on and off until XXXX 2020 when the Appellant left for Canada. The Appellant testified at the hearing that she did not see XXXX after the night she escaped through the window. The RPD raised this discrepancy at the hearing; the Appellant's explanation was that after the escape through the window, she would go to XXXX house to sleep from time to time, but she never actually saw XXXX again because XXXX was never at home when the Appellant would sleep at her house. The RPD asked the Appellant how she could get into XXXX house to sleep if she was not there; the Appellant testified that on those occasions: \"I would go to XXXX house, but at that time XXXX would not be around, with other women that worked with.\"17 I do not accept this as a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy, partly because it is logically circular and partly because it is not responsive to the central inquiry of how the Appellant gained entrance to XXXX house and slept there on more than one occasion, while XXXX was not present. I therefore give XXXX letter little weight.\n[24] Moreover, I also find that the Appellant's allegations that she participated in HOCA to be undermined by contradictions between her BOC and her testimony. The Appellant's BOC described with some specificity, those HOCA meetings she alleged she attended.18 At the hearing, however, she testified she never attended any HOCA meetings: \"they had meetings, but I never attended.\"19 The RPD then asked the Appellant to explain the discrepancy. The Appellant then modified her testimony, explaining that she never went to ordinary general HOCA meetings because she was not at the point of openly identifying herself as a lesbian, instead she met with \"leaders.\"20 The RPD rejected this explanation as not credible because she had described attending meetings in her BOC. The Appellant has argued that the existence of XXXX letter substantiates the plausibility that the Appellant, having known a HOCA leader, could have met with them-being reticent about declaring her orientation at an open meeting. In assessing this discrepancy, I have considered the SOGIESC Guideline at 6.1 and 7.2.1 that observes that claimants may not be comfortable disclosing their sexual orientation to others. I do not, however, ultimately find the Appellant's explanation reasonable given her description in her BOC of the regular HOCA meetings of members she attended and I find her testimony to have evolved in the course of the hearing and I therefore find it undermines her credibility. Regarding the Appellant's argument that the existence of XXXX letter substantiates the possibility that the Appellant might have met with HOCA leaders, as I have already given XXXX letter little weight, I find it cannot substantiate the Appellant's testimony that she attended meetings of HOCA leaders.\n[25] For all the above reasons, I find the Appellant has not established that she was in any way involved with HOCA, attended HOCA meetings or knew a HOCA leader named XXXX.\nGender identity and transitioning\n[26] The RPD found that the Appellant alleged in an amendment to her BOC, disclosed ten days prior to the first sitting in June 2022, that she was now transgender and that this had not been mentioned in her original BOC. The RPD went on to also find that the Appellant had not established that: a) she is transgender, b) she was truly seeking guidance on gender transitions or c) questioned her gender identity from a young age, and that these contradictions undermined her credibility regarding her gender identity. On appeal, the Appellant argues that she never stated that she was transgender or that she was considering gender reassignment surgery and that the RPD erred both in engaging in improper stereotyping, and in making a veiled plausibility finding to discredit the Appellant's claims of gender identity confusion, completely disregarding the Chairperson's Guidelines and was entirely unresponsive to the complexities of SOGIE claims, giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nTransgender identity\n[27] I find the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant stated in her BOC amendment that she was transgender. In reviewing the Appellant's original BOC and her amendments, it is clear that she does not specifically state that she is transgender either in her BOC or its amendments. She makes a number of statements that indicate that she alleges she was in the process of exploring her gender identity. In her initial Basis of Claim form (BOC), the Appellant alleged that:\nI was born female but I do not identify completely with the gender on my passport. Sometimes I feel that I am more like a boy. I feel like I am in the middle.21\nIn her amendment to her BOC, the Appellant included a section Updates about my view about my body and transitioning, in which she alleged that:\nI use she\/her pronouns. But I am attracted to women, so I feel more like a man. If I had a relationship right now, I feel that I would be the male version of the couple. In terms of how I feel about my body, I would say that if I was born with a male body, I would be perfect. But I learned to live with my body right now. Physically I am a woman, but inside I feel more male.22\nThe Appellant also alleged that, having seen a documentary on television about trans people and transitioning;\nIf I had the opportunity and if it is safe, I would want to try this maybe. My lawyer is setting up an appointment with a psychologist that has worked with LGTBTQ people, and transgender individuals in particular, so that I learn more about this process in Nova Scotia.23\nI find the Appellant's two phrases: \"I want to try this maybe\" and her stating she will be consulting a psychologist to \"learn more about this process\" (italics mine) indicate an allegation regarding exploration, not solidification. This wording indicates to me that the Appellant alleged that she was engaged in the process of obtaining more information. I find, therefore, that the RPD erred when it found that the Appellant had alleged in the amendment to her BOC that she was transgender-because the Appellant did not allege in her BOC that she was transgender, she alleged that she was in the process of exploring that option.\nSeeking guidance on transgender surgery\n[28] The RPD found that given the: a) Appellant's lack of understanding of who she was meeting with to discuss transitions, b) the timing of the lawyer's making an appointment with the psychologist (between the first and second sittings), and c) the lack of evidence of such an appointment, the Appellant had not established that she was truly seeking guidance on gender transitions. First, I find the RPD erred in finding that the lawyer's having arranged the psychologist's appointment between the first and second sittings of the hearing indicated a lack of genuine interest in seeking information on transgender surgery. I make this finding simply for the reason that the transcript of the first sitting shows the appointment was not made between the sittings-it had been made prior to the first hearing. We know this because in her testimony at the first, June 21, 2022, hearing, the Appellant testified that she had an appointment with a psychologist to learn more about transitioning.24 Although the Appellant testified, at the second, July 19, 2022, sitting, that the XXXX appointment had been set up by her lawyer in XXXX, this appears to have been a clear error on her part, as she previously testified about the appointment with the psychologist at the June 21, 2022, hearing. Therefore, the RPD erred in finding the timing of the making of the appointment undermined the genuineness of the Appellant's search for guidance on gender transitions simply because the appointment had evidently been made before the first sitting of the hearing began in June.\n[29] Second, I find the Appellant's lack of knowledge concerning the health care professional with whom she was meeting is not material given her testimony at the first sitting of the hearing. The Appellant testified at the second sitting that her lawyer had made an appointment for her so that she could learn about the transitioning process. The Appellant had previously testified at the June sitting that the appointment was with a psychologist. The RPD proceeded however, to question the Appellant, at the July sitting, as to the area of practice and qualifications of the person with whom she was scheduled to meet. The Appellant testified she did not know about the psychologist's qualifications, the lawyer had set the meeting up for her, she would know more when she had met with the psychologist.\nMEMBER: Okay. So, what kind of person is she, is she a professional, is she a psychologist, is she a surgeon, what ... what kind of person is she?\nCLAIMANT: Yes, I have not got to meet her. My lawyer make me up and when I got there I will know much about her.\nMEMBER: But you do not know what she does for a living?\nCLAIMANT: For ... as I said it is for helping me knowing how ... because I asked how she would get me in transit ... transaction ... transitioning, yes.\nMEMBER: So, how would this person be able to help you and give you advice, what ... how does this person have knowledge and how would she be able to help you?\nCLAIMANT: As I have ... because my lawyer knows much better about this person, I will know this in XXXX and much better ... I have not got to meet her like or ask her. It is just an appointment that I took with her.25\nI find the Appellant's responses indicate neither engagement nor a lack of engagement in the process of learning more about gender transitions. I also find the Appellant's responses to have been reasonable. She had already testified at the previous sitting that it was a psychologist with whom she was meeting; her lawyer had set up the meeting; the purpose was to learn about transitioning; she would know more about the professional with whom she was to meet after she had had the appointment. I find the Appellant did not demonstrate an undue lack of engagement or knowledge about the appointment.\n[30] Third, the Appellant testified at two sittings, consistently, that such an appointment had been made and that it was scheduled for XXXX. The Appellant's lawyer confirmed in submissions that such an appointment had been made. Given this, I do not find that a lack of evidence to show that such an appointment had actually been made indicates a lack of genuine interest on the part of the Appellant regarding gender transitions.\n[31] I therefore find the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant had not established that she was seeking guidance on gender transitions.\nQuestioning her gender identity from an early age\n[32] I find the Appellant's testimony's divergence from both BOCs undermines her claims that she questioned her gender from an early age. The RPD found that the Appellant had not established that she had questioned her gender identity from an early age. The RPD based this finding principally on: a) what it identified as a discrepancy between her original BOC and her amended BOC regarding what age she was when she began to question her gender identity, b) the Appellant's explanation regarding this discrepancy, which the RPD did not find reasonable; c) the Appellant's explanation for why she had not discussed gender identity with her XXXX XXXX girlfriend, XXXX-which the RPD also did not find reasonable. The Appellant argues that the RPD disregarded and misconstrued the Appellant's own BOCs and testimony, was crudely reductive in its analysis and specifically disregarded the SOGIESC Guideline's caution regarding disclosure of gender identity concerns to others: \"SOCIESC individuals are not necessarily comfortable disclosing their identity to others in their lives\" and in doing so, made a veiled plausibility finding regarding the Appellant's disclosing her feelings to XXXX-a variety of finding which should be done only in the clearest of cases.\n[33] I have independently reviewed the record before me. In the Appellant's original BOC, she alleged that in 2014, when she was 11 years old, she \"began to notice her attraction to girls.\"26 In her amended BOC, the Appellant alleged that when she was a child she did not feel comfortable in her body, did not like wearing girl's clothing, and when she began to go through puberty, she wished her body would not change but stay the way it was.27 At the first sitting of the hearing, the RPD asked the Appellant whether she identified as a man or a woman; the Appellant testified that \"for now\" she was a woman but in the future she wanted to be a male and the RPD asked her when she began to feel that way.28\nCLAIMANT: When I started growing up and when I started growing breasts and I started feeling different, in a different way and because I wanted to change and I felt that I was born different.\nMEMBER: So, you felt that you wanted to be a boy when you were growing up?\nCLAIMANT: Yes.\nMEMBER: Like that you actually wanted to be a different gender?\nCLAIMANT: Um-hum.29\nThe RPD then subsequently asked the Appellant why, given this testimony, she had not stated in her original BOC that \"she was uncomfortable in her body, that she might want to become a man.\"30 The Appellant's explanation was that when she completed her BOC with her lawyer, she was still feeling the effects of trauma from her time in Rwanda which, she testified, had resulted in some \"blanks\" in her memory, felt constrained by having to compress her entire experience into a single narrative and, finally, did not feel entirely comfortable with fully disclosing her story to her lawyer: \"sometimes I was not really opened up to tell her everything.\"31 The RPD did not accept this as a reasonable explanation for the divergence between testimony and BOC as the Appellant was claiming protection-not in a rush as she crossed the border-but \"eighteen months after she arrived in Canada, with the help of her counsel.\"32\n[34] I find the RPD did not err in its interpretation of the Appellant's BOC, her testimony and, in its analysis of the Appellant's explanation. The Appellant's original BOC focused on her core claim-that she is a lesbian, is attracted to women, and therefore is at risk of harm in Rwanda. She stated \"I was born female but I do not identify completely with the gender on my passport.\" 33 She went on to say that she sometimes feels more like a male: \"I feel I am in the middle.\"34 Her amended BOC further alleged that, as a child, she did not like being put into girls' clothes and felt uncomfortable with the changes manifesting in her body at the onset of puberty. However, neither her original BOC, nor her amendment contain the allegation which the Appellant first made at the hearing-that when she was growing up, she had felt she wanted to be a different gender, that she had wanted to be a boy from childhood. Feeling uncomfortable with bodily changes at puberty and not liking to wear girls clothing is not synonymous with wanting to be a different gender. I therefore find that the Appellant has not established that she had questioned her gender identity from an early age. I also find that her explanation for not having been as explicit about her questioning her gender identity in her BOC as she was at the hearing to not be reasonable-she did not feel entirely comfortable with fully disclosing her story to her lawyer-given the kind of detail which both her original BOC and her amended BOC contain, I do not find it reasonable that the Appellant would have qualms about revealing that she had had the same feelings as a child.\n[35] I therefore find that the Appellant's testimony was not consistent with either of her BOC's and this undermines her allegations that she questioned her gender identity from an early age.\n[36] The RPD also found that the Appellant's not confiding her feelings about her gender and body to her XXXX XXXX girlfriend, XXXX, to indicate that the Appellant had not, in fact, been questioning her gender identity from an early age. The RPD did not accept as reasonable the Appellant's explanation for not having discussed her questioning her gender identity with XXXX. The RPD characterized the Appellant's testimony as follows: the RPD \"asked the claimant whether she had told her girlfriend, XXXX, about wanting to be a boy, while at school in Rwanda. She said no, she did not remember having a conversation about that with her. She was busy with school and her family and so it 'slipped her mind'.\"35 The RPD did not accept this explanation as reasonable; even were one just that busy it could not simply \"slip your mind\" to speak to your girlfriend about something so important.\n[37] First of all, I find the RPD simply misinterpreted the Appellant's explanation. The Appellant did not say that when she and XXXX were at school together, it had slipped her mind to tell XXXX about how she felt about her body because she was so caught up in school-the Appellant's testimony was that her memory of her conversations with XXXX was faulty: \"maybe it slipped my mind, I do not have any memory of telling her or letting her know that I am uncomfortable being the way I am.\"36 I find, therefore, that the RPD erred in its finding that the Appellant's not having confided in XXXX indicated that she had not been questioning her gender identity from an early age. Whereas the Appellant, in fact, testified that she did not remember having told XXXX.\n[38] Notwithstanding, and for all the above reasons, I find that the Appellant has not established that she questioned her gender identity from an early age.\nSexual assault\n[39] I find the question of whether the Appellant was sexually assaulted is not material to her claim regarding her sexual orientation. I also find that the Appellant has not established that she was sexually assaulted. The RPD found that the Appellant had not established that the sexual assault by a pastor and two men at the church during a praying therapy session took place as alleged. On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD showed cruel bias and disregarded the Gender Guidelines in its dismissal of the Appellant's allegations that she was sexually assaulted, implying that the RPD had improperly concluded that a \"legitimate\" survivor of sexual assault would be able to discuss that assault three years later, made several additional veiled plausibility findings without proper justification and conducted a selective review of the evidence.\n[40] I have reviewed the record before me and taken into consideration the Chairperson's SOGIESC Guideline. In her BOC the Appellant alleged that, during one of the conversion therapy sessions her family had mandated, she was assaulted by one of the pastors and two men. She alleged that she did not tell anyone, including her parents or the police about the assault. At the July sitting, the Appellant testified that she was not yet ready to talk about the assault. She also testified that at the time she had told no one about the assault. I find that the Appellant's not wishing to testify about the assault does not undermine her credibility. Guideline 4 states that:\n5.4.5 In some cases, it may not be necessary for the individual to testify about past trauma when sufficiently credible documentary evidence has been submitted in support of the allegations. Alternatively, where there are serious credibility concerns, it may be necessary for the member to question the individual about difficult matters that could relate to trauma. It is appropriate for members to do this, but they must be conscious of the trauma-informed approach set out in this Guideline.\nHere, the Appellant has neither submitted any documentary evidence, nor has she offered any testimony about the alleged assault. Given the numerous credibility concerns with the Appellant's evidence, discussed above, I find that the RPD did not err in finding that-without testimony or any evidence regarding the assault-the Appellant did not establish on a balance of probabilities that this assault took place. I further find, however, that whether the assault did or did not take place is not material in any way to the Appellant's allegations regarding her sexual orientation.\nOmission from the brother's letter\n[41] I find the delay in claiming protection undermines the Appellant's credibility that has not been satisfactorily explained. The RPD found that the Appellant had not established that she tried to move to another city to claim refugee status and had not provided a reasonable explanation for the 18-month delay in claiming refugee status between XXXX 2020-when she arrived in Canada-and her claiming in March 2021, three months after her status in Canada had expired. The RPD found that this delay undermined her credibility as regarding the central allegations of her claim and fear of persecution. The Appellant argues, on appeal, that the RPD erred by assessing the brother's letter for its not stating explicitly that the Appellant considered moving to another major Canadian city to claim protection and that was the reason for her delay in claiming, arguing that it is an error to assess evidence for what it does not contain.\n[42] The Appellant claimed in her BOC that around XXXX 2020 her brother told her about a Rwandan friend of his who had told him Canada offers refugee protection to gay persons; the Appellant claimed she then looked online and found resources in Montreal and Ottawa, but after trying to accumulate funds, she found she could not afford to move. At the hearing, the Appellant testified that only in XXXX 2021 did she and her brother learn about the Halifax Refugee Clinic. The RPD found that it was not reasonable that, having two older siblings in Halifax, both of whom had been students here for a number of years, no one would have looked online in the fourteen months since the Appellant had come to Halifax to see if refugee resources existed in Halifax, nor was it reasonable that her brother would have been helping her to try to move to Montreal or Ottawa, believing that only could refugee claims be initiated in those cities. The RPD also found that the brother's letter of support-mentioning none of the idea of moving to another city-could not support the Appellant's claim that her delay in filing was caused by her trying to accumulate funds to move to Ottawa or Montreal. I find that the RPD did not err as the RPD simply found that the brother's letter could not support the Appellant's allegations that her delay was caused by her believing she had to move to Ottawa or Montreal. The RPD did not discredit the brother's letter or give it little weight-the RPD simply observed that it could not support a particular allegation as it was silent on that point. For all the above reasons, I find that the RPD did not err.\n[43] I also do not accept as reasonable, the Appellant's allegation and argument that she delayed claiming protection because she was under the incorrect assumption that she could only claim in Ottawa or Montreal and had to move to those cities. I do not find that reasonable because: a) she has two older siblings who have been resident in Halifax for some years, b) she has testified that she has friends and acquaintances in the Rwandan community in Halifax, for example, D, c) she testified that she had gone online more than once to search for resources for refugees in Canada. For all these reasons, I do not accept as reasonable the Appellant's explanation regarding her delay in claiming protection and I find her credibility is undermined by the delay.\nInconsistencies regarding claims of treatment by the police\n[44] I find the RPD mischaracterized the Appellant's allegations regarding how she was treated by the police on her release. The Appellant alleged in her BOC, and testified that in 2019 she was arrested with a friend for stealing tablets. The RPD found a number of irregularities concerning the Appellant's arrest, detention by the police, release and the summons which the Appellant disclosed, finding inconsistencies with-and contradictions by-the Appellant's testimony. Although the Appellant does not challenge the majority of these findings, the Appellant argues the RPD created a credibility issue where none existed in finding a contradiction regarding whether the Appellant suspected the releasing police officer wanted her telephone number or wanted her to come to his house. In the Appellant's BOC she stated that she suspected the officer requesting her telephone number wanted to meet her later. In her testimony she said the officer called her up after her release and asked her to come to his house after which she blocked his number. The RPD described this encounter as more coercive, he told her she had no choice, she had to go to his house. Having read the transcript and BOC, I find the RPD erred in mis-characterizing the Appellant's recollection of the officer's actions following her release. I accept that the RPD mischaracterized the Appellant's recollection and I find that the Appellant's allegation in her BOC are not contradicted by her testimony in this respect.\nReasonable apprehension of bias\n[45] I do not find the RPD's analysis or reasons give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Appellant has argued that the RPD's reasons are tainted as a whole by a reasonable apprehension of bias. The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is set out in Committee for Justice and Liberty et al v. National Energy Board et al 1976 CanLII 2 (SCC):\n[T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one held by reasonable and right-minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude.\"\n[46] The Supreme Court of Canada, moreover, has emphasized that the threshold for a finding of real or perceived bias is high.37 I have independently reviewed the record before me. I do not find the RPD disregarded the Chairperson's Guidelines, indeed the RPD specifically cited the Guidelines on more than one occasion and was attentive to the model of SOGIESC. Specifically in paragraph 14 of the Reasons, the RPD noted the fluidity of gender identity and I find that the RPD was attentive to the nuances of gender identity and did not require the Appellant's testimony or narrative to conform to a prescribed pattern. I do not find the RPD's analysis or its processes in arriving at its conclusions in the Reasons to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] For all the above reasons, I find the Appellant's credibility has been undermined by the omissions, inconsistencies, discrepancies and contradictions in the Appellant's evidence and testimony to the point where the Appellant has failed to credibly establish her sexual orientation. I therefore find that the RPD did not err in its decision that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. I therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAndrea Poole\nAndrea Poole\nFebruary 14, 2023\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n3 IRPA, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, at para 111(1)(a).\n4 RPD Record, Amendments to Basis of Claim (BOC), at p. 24.\n5 Appellant's Record, Appellant's Memorandum, at p. 3.\n6 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The RPD was correct in concluding that the appellant XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. He did not rebut the presumption of Algerian state protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The appellant submitted five documents as new evidence. The RPD's reasons, the case law, and the National Documentation Package (NDP) tabs are not new evidence within the meaning of subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). I will take these documents into account in my reasons. He presented two new pieces of evidence, A-1: text message from the brother threatening the appellant, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, and A-2: new letter from the father, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.\nExhibits A-1 and A-2 are admitted\n[7] New evidence is admissible if it meets at least one of the three criteria set out in subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, namely, that the evidence or events referred to therein arose after the rejection of his claim (1) or were not reasonably available at the time of the decision (2) or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection (3).1 If at least one of these requirements is met, he must also establish that it meets the case law criteria of credibility, newness and relevance.2\n[8] The appellant submits that the new evidence was not available at the time of the hearing.\n[9] Exhibits A-1 and A-2 meet the first criterion of 110(4). They are dated after the claim was rejected on XXXX XXXX, 2022. The first mentions new threats from the appellant's brother. The second mentions that the appellant's brother was still threatening his brother in XXXX2022. The appellant's father gives his opinion on police protection. As I discuss later in this appeal, the father's opinion is based on unsubstantiated beliefs.\n[10] The exhibits meet the newness criterion in that they show that the brother continued his threats after the hearing; they are credible and relevant.\nThe Refugee Appeal Division denies the request for an oral hearing\n[11] The RAD may hear an appellant if new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to his credibility, is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim, and would justify allowing or rejecting it.\n[12] The evidence admitted does not raise a serious issue with respect to credibility, as I find that the appellant is credible, but I consider that the determinative issue is Algerian state protection. The evidence would not serve to justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\nANALYSIS\n[13] My role is to examine all of the evidence, which includes listening to the hearing,3 and to establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.4\nThe Refugee Protection Division's reasons\n[14] The RPD found that the appellant was not credible due to:\na. the two-year delay in claiming refugee protection, which is not consistent with someone who fears for their life;\nb. the fact that the documents disclosed do not show any link between the brother's legal problems and the appellant's responsibility with respect to his incarceration, except for the father's letter (P-6) to which it gives little weight; and\nc. a major contradiction that the brother benefited from the services of a lawyer.\n[15] It considers that the appellant did not avail himself of Algerian state protection (no complaint was filed even though the brother had a long history of delinquency) and that he did not rebut the presumption of Algerian state protection. It considers that the evidence on the country conditions demonstrates that Algeria is a democratic country with a functioning government and police force.\nThe Refugee Protection Division complied with the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice\n[16] The appellant submits that in asking him what would happen if his brother came to pursue him in Canada instead of asking him why he did not seek protection from the Algerian authorities, the RPD created confusion in his mind, rendering the process unfair, that it did not take into account his response that his brother has a criminal record and will not be able to leave the country, and that in distorting his testimony, it rendered the proceedings unfair.\n[17] After listening to the recording of the hearing, I cannot agree with the appellant's arguments. Neither at the hearing nor in the RPD's reasons did I note a breach of procedural fairness or natural justice.\n[18] In terms of the principles of natural justice, the RPD has two major duties, namely, the duty of procedural fairness, which includes giving the appellant the opportunity to present his case fully and to be heard, and the duty of being impartial.\n[19] The appellant had the opportunity to be heard. I do not see how the RPD's conduct of the hearing or line of questioning could have created confusion in the appellant's mind and breached procedural fairness. He did not state anything about this at the hearing, nor did his counsel, either when the RPD asked its questions or at the end of the hearing. I did not note any moment at which the appellant seemed confused. I agree that the RPD could have asked the appellant directly why he did not seek police assistance in Algeria, instead of trying to get him to state that if it happened in Canada, he would call the police to protect himself from his brother's death threats. However, I note that it questioned the appellant adequately regarding his allegations. It patiently repeated questions several times when the appellant did not answer directly. It informed him of its concerns about questions it had with respect to certain elements of his claim. For example, it shared its screen to show him its observations concerning the brother's sentencing and allowed him to provide explanations. Questioning a refugee protection claimant in order to clarify their evidence or test their credibility is not a breach of procedural fairness. His counsel was able to complete the presentation of the claim with questions and submissions at the end of the hearing. For example, he allowed the appellant to complete his answer on his two-year delay in claiming refugee protection.\n[20] Regarding the issue of bias, the appellant raises no argument and I have no reason to believe that the RPD was biased or that the decision rendered was not fair.5 Although I have corrected some of the RPD's errors, this does not mean that the RPD was biased.\nThe appellant's delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada is not determinative\n[21] The appellant submits that the RPD's approach defies all logic, that it does not explain why the fact that his brother has a criminal past would justify claiming refugee protection upon arriving in Canada without delay and hoping that his brother will calm down. He is of the opinion that it is understandable that he chose peace and family harmony over a refugee protection claim that was only a last resort. He notes that his status in Canada was valid until XXXX 2021, and that it was only when his student status ended and he saw no prospect of returning to his country that he claimed refugee protection. He notes that the delay in claiming refugee protection is not determinative.\n[22] I accept the appellant's arguments and his explanations are satisfactory. The governing principles concerning delay in seeking refugee protection are well established by the case law.6 This delay is not usually determinative, but it is a factor that can be taken into account when assessing credibility. The explanation for the delay may or may not be satisfactory, depending on the claimant's personal attributes and circumstances.\n[23] The appellant testified that he came to Canada to escape his brother. He arrived on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, that is, before his brother was released from prison. He was still staying in Canada legally when he signed his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) on August 16, 2021. According to the evidence,7 he held a student visa, issued in Paris on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and valid until XXXX XXXX, 2021. His explanation at the hearing8 is satisfactory: he came to Canada to escape his brother, but did not claim refugee protection before in the hope that his father would be able to convince his brother to change his mind and give up his revenge. This explanation is satisfactory, as he has stayed in Canada legally, without risking deportation to the country of alleged fear.\nNo link between the brother's legal problems and the appellant's responsibility\n[24] The appellant submits that the RPD erred, that his father's letter establishes this causal link that is in his brother's head. He submits that he never asserted that his brother did not have a lawyer, but rather that he objected to the family paying for one for him.\n[25] The RPD erred in not analyzing the motivation of the alleged agent of harm from his perspective. In this case, the appellant does not mention in his BOC Form that his brother is angry with him because of the lawyer (he states that his brother is angry with him because he flushed his pills down the toilet and hid his knives, and mentions neither the fine nor the lawyer). However, his father mentions this in his XXXX 2022 letter: the brother blames his incarceration on his brother, the appellant. That the appellant refused to pay the lawyer and\/or the fine does not change the fact that his brother holds him responsible for his incarceration and that the evidence establishes that he threatened to kill him.\n[26] The appellant is presumed to be telling the truth and the RPD's conclusions to rebut this presumption are not sufficient. For the remainder of my analysis, I therefore presume that the appellant established that he received death threats from his brother. However, the determinative issue is Algerian state protection, and I conclude that the appellant did not rebut the presumption of Algerian state protection by clear and convincing evidence.\nThe appellant did not rebut the presumption of Algerian state protection\n[27] The appellant argues that:\na. The RPD erred in analyzing his response on the reasons why he would not file a complaint in Algeria regarding his brother's threats.\nb. In Algeria, evidence is required to file a complaint, and his brother's threats were verbal.\nc. Just because his brother has a long history of delinquency does not mean that the Algerian justice system will automatically investigate any complaint against him, even in the absence of incriminating evidence, and if Algeria is a state governed by the rule of law, as the RPD suggests, it is unlikely that proceedings would be brought without evidence.\nd. In Algeria, the police do not intervene in family disputes, such as forced marriages, and the RPD had to take this particular cultural context into account.\ne. It is debatable whether Algeria is a democratic country. The evidence reports arbitrary arrests, which are common practice, violations of freedoms and rights, corruption.\nf. The RPD's analysis is selective. It retained only the evidence supporting the rejection of his claim, without offsetting this by and weighing what was in his favour.\ng. He did not have to stay in Algeria to file a complaint with the sole intention of demonstrating the existence of state protection, taking the risk of continuing to subject himself to his brother's wrath and his death threats.\nh. His brother's text message, submitted as new evidence, confirms his desire for revenge.\n[28] Although the RPD made errors, which I corrected in this appeal, I confirm its conclusion that the appellant did not rebut the presumption of state protection by \"clear and convincing\" evidence of its inability to protect him.9\n[29] The issue of state protection is always a determinative issue in refugee protection claims. The definition of a Convention refugee states that refugee protection claimants must be unable or, by reason of their fear of persecution, be unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of their country of nationality. The ability of their country of citizenship to provide protection is a crucial element in determining whether their fear of persecution or risk is well-founded. In his case, the appellant was unwilling to avail himself of the protection of his country, even though such protection was available and adequate.\n[30] The burden of proof lies with the appellant. The standard of proof is that of a balance of probabilities. The quality of the evidence required to rebut the presumption of state protection is clear and convincing evidence that said protection is inadequate or non-existent,10 which means the evidence must be trustworthy and have probative value. It is established that when a state is considered to be democratic, refugee protection claimants must provide clear and convincing justification for not seeking state protection. If they cannot demonstrate that they have taken concrete steps to obtain state protection, they cannot seek the protection of a third country by making a refugee protection claim.11\n[31] The appellant alleges that the RPD did not properly analyze the reasons for his refusal to avail himself of Algerian state protection. In this case, even if the RPD is presumed to have considered all the evidence, I am of the view that it did not adopt a contextual approach when analyzing Algerian state protection, as recognized by the case law.12 The RPD simply concluded that the appellant did not attempt to obtain assistance without addressing the nature of the alleged risk, the profile of his agent of harm or the documentary evidence concerning Algeria. I corrected this error by taking into account the profile of the brother, alleged agent of harm, and the documentary evidence in the NDP on Algeria. The brother is a person with a criminal record, with no alleged ties to police officers or persons likely to influence the police or the justice system.\nAlgerian state protection is operational and effective13\n[32] I do not accept the appellant's arguments that the RPD considered only the evidence that weighed against him. On the one hand, the RPD is presumed to have considered all of the evidence. On the other hand, although its analysis is not detailed, it correctly relied on the documentary evidence to establish the protection options available to victims in Algeria.14 The appellant did not submit any documentary evidence, other than that in the NDP, to rebut the presumption of Algerian state protection.15\n[33] I reviewed the documentary evidence. I note that the Algerian police are efficient and have the resources to investigate. They are ranked fifth in the world in terms of efficiency and resources.16 For example, the same document states that ordinary crimes, including crimes against individuals, were down in Algeria and that all murder cases had been solved. The 2020 Country Policy and Information Note17 states that the police in Algeria are generally professional and responsive to calls for assistance. The appellant could also file a complaint remotely, since according to the evidence, Algerian citizens have a number of options for filing a complaint with the gendarmerie or the police, in person or online.18 He did not do so.\n[34] I do not accept the appellant's argument that, for the purposes of the analysis of state protection, Algeria cannot be considered a democracy. Although Algeria faces significant human rights issues, Algeria is a democratic and popular republic, a constitutional, multiparty representative democracy whose president is elected by universal suffrage for a five-year term.19\n[35] Although there are credible reports of serious issues with respect to arbitrary arrests and the independence and impartiality of the justice system, state protection does not have to be perfect20 to be adequate. In the appellant's case, these serious issues would not render protection inadequate, since the evidence shows that the Algerian legal and judicial system has already arrested and convicted his brother. He did not allege that his brother had any contacts or means enabling him to bribe police officers or magistrates.\n[36] For these reasons, and having conducted an independent analysis of the evidence, the RAD concludes that the Algerian state has the ability and the willingness to protect its citizens with functional and effective protection.\nThe appellant could reasonably avail himself of Algerian state protection\n[37] The RPD concludes that the fact that the appellant did not even try to get help from the police in the face of death threats is a fatal factor.\n[38] The appellant must show either that he made all reasonable efforts to obtain Algerian state protection, or that it would have been objectively unreasonable for him to do so.21\n[39] The RPD erred in not analyzing the appellant's explanations regarding his reasons for not seeking Algerian state protection. I corrected this error by analyzing the appellant's reluctance to avail himself of state protection, and I conclude that it would have been reasonable for him to seek Algerian state protection.\n[40] The appellant submits that he never tried to file a complaint because the police do not intervene in family disputes, and in Algeria, evidence is required to file a complaint.\n[41] I do not accept the appellant's argument that Algerian justice would not arrest and prosecute his brother for death threats without evidence because the threats were verbal.\n[42] The appellant has evidence of these threats, namely his father's written testimony, submitted in evidence before the RPD and on appeal, as part of his refugee protection claim. As he submits, he also has the text message submitted in evidence before the RAD, which [translation] \"confirms [his brother's] desire for revenge.\" He did not provide any documentary evidence to support his argument. He could have filed newspaper articles reporting situations where the authorities failed to intervene in cases where verbal death threats were made against a person, or a legal opinion from an Algerian lawyer on the Algerian state's penal or criminal treatment of death threats.\n[43] In consulting the NDP, I noted that Tab 4.1122 refers to a news article23 that specifically reports on death threats between members of the same family. It states that the Algerian penal code, in articles 284 and following, addresses the crime of threats, including verbal threats, which contradicts the appellant's hypothesis.\n[44] I do not accept the appellant's argument that he did not file a complaint because the police do not intervene in family disputes. He submits that the Response for Information Request on Algeria24 indicates that in Algeria's particular cultural context, state protection is not an option in some cases. His documentary evidence does not document the management of intrafamily conflicts between adult male siblings. Algeria is a country where women's rights, while evolving, are still highly unequal. I do not consider that the practices of the police, the courts or even civil society in cases of violence against women, such as forced marriage, can be extended to all intrafamily conflicts, as the appellant submits.\n[45] The tab in the NDP25 that documents the issue of domestic violence and the attitude of the police deals with violence against women. Mediation is mandatory in divorce cases.26 I have not identified any document that states that the authorities would not intervene in the event of a conflict between two adult brothers, with one threatening to kill the other. The appellant has not brought to my attention any NDP document to this effect.\n[46] The fact that his brother has a long criminal record is likely to be a relevant factor for the police when investigating the brother's death threats.\n[47] The opinion of the appellant's father does not provide a basis to draw any conclusions about the police's willingness to deal with this case or their effectiveness. He does not support his opinion with any documentary evidence, and he is not a legal expert or an expert on the issue of Algerian state protection. His opinion is based on the same unsubstantiated beliefs as those of his son, the appellant.\n[48] The fears raised by the appellant for not having attempted to avail himself of state protection are based on speculative subjective fears. Even if his perceptions are sincere, he submitted no satisfactory evidence to establish them, on a balance of probabilities.\n[49] I do not accept the appellant's argument that he did not have to remain in Algeria to file a complaint with the sole intention of demonstrating the existence of state protection, by taking the risk of continuing to subject himself to his brother's wrath and death threats.\n[50] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, his brother was sentenced to XXXX years in prison; his appeal was dismissed and he remained imprisoned until XXXX XXXX, 2020.27 The appellant testified that he left Algeria on XXXX XXXX, 2019, to protect himself from his brother's threats.28 At the time, he did not seek state protection in his country of citizenship, as his brother was still in prison and did not constitute a direct danger. He could have filed a complaint, but he did not. If he thought his brother could send people in his place, he could file a complaint. He did not. Nor did he submit any evidence linking his brother to criminal gangs or anyone else who could target the appellant while he was in custody. These are only hypotheses not supported by evidence. Nor has he sought state protection by filing a complaint against the death threats that have occurred since his brother's release from prison, even though Algerian citizens can file complaints online.29\n[51] As for putting himself in danger by going to the police, the appellant has submitted no evidence or allegation that asking the authorities for help would in itself put him in danger.\n[52] The appellant submits that the RPD must go beyond the texts and take reality into account, examine the problems that prevent the concrete and effective implementation of the texts-corruption, family and cultural problems in general-and that the RPD did not address this dimension of his counsel's arguments.\n[53] The RPD is presumed to consider all of the evidence. In my reasons, I completed the analysis of Algerian state protection and took into account the appellant's arguments in my reasons. The burden of rebutting the presumption of Algerian state protection lies with him, and he has filed no clear and convincing evidence to rebut the said presumption.\n[54] Not having sought out police protection on an incident for which there was no alleged connection to police, and not having shown a convincing reason why seeking state protection would endanger him, he has not met his burden of proof.30 It was reasonable for him to seek Algerian state protection before seeking protection in Canada.\n[55] The appellant submits that the RPD did not bring up an internal flight alternative (IFA), but proposed Algiers, Oran and Tlemcen at the hearing. Neither the RPD nor the RAD need assess whether the appellant has an IFA in Algeria. The determinative issue is Algerian state protection. The appellant will be able to return to Algeria and avail himself of this protection.\n[56] The appellant did not demonstrate that state protection was unavailable to him. He refused to file a complaint and provided no solid arguments to justify his fear of seeking state protection. His refusal is based on a belief, unsupported by the evidence, that Algerian authorities refuse to intervene in intrafamily disputes such as the one with his brother, or for the lack of evidence of threats. Before claiming that the steps he took with the Algerian authorities were unsuccessful, he should at least have taken steps, since there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that he would have risked his life in doing so.\n[57] The RPD's decision is correct. The appellant has presented no clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of Algerian state protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[58] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD's determination that the appellant XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMe Agn\u00e8s Connat\nMe Agn\u00e8s Connat\nMarch 16, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c. 27, subsection 110(4).\n2 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The appellants left Haiti for Chile in XXXX 2017 after an attack by rebels motivated by the male appellant's support for the Parti ha\u00eftien Tet Kal\u00e9 (PHTK) in XXXX 2015. With no possibility of obtaining a work permit, and after experiencing discrimination as foreigners in Chile, they left the country in XXXX 2021 and arrived in the United States in XXXX 2021, before travelling to Canada in XXXX 2022.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concluded that the appellants have an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Port-au-Prince.\n[3] The appellants are arguing that the RPD erred in the analysis of the male appellant's testimony. They submit that the RPD erred with regard to the IFA and that refuge in Port-au-Prince would be [translation] \"suicidal.\"\n[4] The determinative issues for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) are credibility, the IFA and protection from the Haitian state.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The appeal is allowed. I substitute the RPD's determination with my own determination that the appellants XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees. Their allegations are credible. They would face a serious possibility of persecution if they returned to XXXX but do not have a viable IFA in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie because of the undue hardship and great physical danger they would face in order to get there. They cannot avail themselves of adequate state protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The appellants are submitting a statement from XXXX XXXX, a lawyer in Haiti.\nThe evidence presented by the appellants is rejected\n[7] To be admissible, new evidence must meet at least one of the three criteria in subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). If at least one of these requirements is met, the appellants must establish that the new evidence meets the case law criteria of credibility, newness and relevance.1\n[8] The letter is dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022, that is, after the refugee protection claim was rejected on October 26, 2022. The events described in the first and last paragraphs occurred before the claim was rejected. The male appellant has not explained why they were not reasonably available before the claim was rejected, and I see no reason why he could not have obtained this information in order to present it before the RPD. The RAD is not an opportunity to complete a deficient record.\n[9] The events recounted in the second paragraph about the socio-political and security situation and the killing of police officers by gangs operating in Port-au-Prince are events that occurred both before the refugee protection claim was rejected and after the claim was rejected in XXXX 2022. However, even if I consider that these events meet the first criterion, they do not meet the newness criterion, since the issue of gangs in Port-au-Prince is documented in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Haiti.2 The killing of Divisional Commissioner Rigaud on November 25, 2022, meets the first criterion of 110(4). The information is not new, since the killing of police officers and magistrates is unfortunately a reality in Haiti3 and was known at the time of the hearing.\nNOTICE TO THE PARTIES\n[10] On February 27, 2023, in accordance with Alazar, the RAD notified the appellants and the Minister of its intention to address new issues about the risk, should they return to Haiti, at the hands of the criminals who attacked the male appellant in 2017, and whether the Haitian authorities can provide them with adequate protection. The RPD proposed Port-au-Prince as an IFA. The RAD is instead considering an IFA in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.\n[11] On March 13, 2023, the appellants filed submissions within the prescribed time limit. The Minister had not filed any additional submissions as of the time these reasons were signed. The Minister did not ask to intervene.\nThe new evidence further to the Refugee Appeal Division's notice is rejected\n[12] The appellants submit a news article dated October 5, 2019, by Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. They do not explain how this new evidence meets the requirements of rule 29 of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules) or those of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and the jurisprudential criteria.\n[13] The article filed by the appellants in response to the RAD's notice is rejected because it does not meet the criteria of the RAD Rules. Although it is relevant and has probative value, it provides no new evidence to this appeal, as the information it relates is in the NDP. Moreover, with reasonable effort the appellants could have submitted it with their appeal record, since the violence in Port-au-Prince, the IFA proposed by the RPD, was a determinative issue. They do not explain why they were unable to present this article from the Internet with their appeal record.\nANALYSIS\n[14] My role is to examine all of the evidence, including listening to the hearing,4 and to establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.5\nThe Refugee Protection Division erred in choosing Port-au-Prince as an internal flight alternative\n[15] The appellants submit that they have discharged their burden of proving that their lives would be at risk from the people who attacked them if they returned to Haiti, that this country is rife with heinous crimes where vengeance and gangs are rampant, and that no one would advise a person to walk into the lion's den in Port-au-Prince, the stronghold of all these organizations.\n[16] I accept the appellants' arguments. Considering the documentary evidence on the situation in Port-au-Prince,6 with the clashes between rival gang members forcing thousands of Haitians to relocate to flee the violence, I consider that this city will be no less hostile for the appellants than their hometown of XXXX. For this reason, I asked them to make their submissions on the possibility of relocating to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, two cities located across from their hometown of XXXX, on Haiti's southwestern peninsula.\nThe appellants would face a serious possibility of persecution in XXXX\n[17] The RPD found that for the purposes of the IFA assessment, the appellants' allegations were credible, except for the reasons for the murder of his cousin and his wife in XXXX 2022.\n[18] The appellants submit that the RPD did not consider all of the testimony in its decision, did not take into account the presumption of truthfulness for his testimony and did not provide rigorous arguments in its reasons. They are disputing that, on the one hand, the RPD stated that it was prepared to believe the circumstances of the assault in XXXX 2017 but, on the other hand, was not prepared to believe the reason for the murders of the cousin and his wife, when the male appellant testified that the murder was related to his membership in the PHTK party.\n[19] The RPD erred in concluding that it did not believe the male appellant when he stated that his cousin had been murdered for the same reasons as him. It did not have sufficient reasons to reject this part of his testimony and did not apply the presumption of truthfulness in Maldonado.7\n[20] The RPD found all of the male appellant's allegations about what happened in 2017 to be credible. It could not simply conclude that it did not believe the story about his cousin. I am aware that refugee protection claimants must state all the important information in their Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) or risk having their credibility questioned, and the appellants did not mention this event in their initial BOC Form. However, I draw no negative inference from the omission at the hearing since the male appellant amended his BOC Form at the very beginning of the hearing and this is the only omission or inconsistency in his testimony.\n[21] The fact that his cousin was killed by individuals because of his involvement with the PHTK corroborates the fact that this type of crime still existed in XXXX in 2022 and that if the male appellant were to return to XXXX, he could once again be targeted by the killers who might recognize him after hearing rumours of his return, or cross paths with him while he is living there.\nThe appellants could live safely in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie\n[22] Although the appellants have established a serious possibility of persecution in XXXX, they must establish that they could not live safely in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.\n[23] The RPD concluded that the appellants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of persecution are motivated to search for them throughout Haiti and to locate them in the city of Port-au-Prince, that it is unlikely that the male appellant could still be of interest to the unidentified individuals who assaulted him in XXXX 2017, that they did not attack him afterwards while he was still in the country, and that five years have passed.\n[24] The RPD's conclusion is correct. After conducting my independent analysis of the evidence, I conclude that the appellants have not established that the alleged agents of persecution would have the motivation and would try to find them elsewhere in the country.\n[25] Even if the alleged agents of persecution had the means to find the appellants through their network or by word of mouth, they must establish on a balance of probabilities that they have the motivation to find them in the proposed IFAs.\n[26] Their family members still live in XXXX and XXXX, and the agents of persecution have never gone after them, even though the documentary evidence indicates that criminals may attack the family members of a wanted person to pressure them or take revenge.\n[27] The male appellant did not state that his cousin was murdered because of him, but for a similar reason, namely his political support for the PHTK.\n[28] The passage of time is also a factor that must be taken into account. The initial events took place in 2017, six years ago. In this kind of situation, an attack motivated by a person's political opinion, with no evidence to support a conclusion that the agents of persecution are still looking for them or have tried to seek revenge, the passage of time is an additional element and supports the conclusion that the alleged agents of persecution are unlikely to have the motivation to find the appellants if they relocated to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.\n[29] The appellants submit that the RPD erred in concluding that the male appellant had returned to live at his home between the assault and his departure from the country, and that he was not attacked during this period. On the contrary, he testified that he had lived at his parents' home and only at his parents' home, that he was living in hiding, and that he rarely left the house, taking precautions such as hiring a nurse for his care in order to avoid exposing himself by going to the hospital and to avoid being recognized by the assailants.\n[30] The RPD's conclusion is correct. Although the appellant did not leave his house before he left Haiti, he alleges that the agents of persecution are dangerous criminals and that they would be motivated to go after him if he returned to Haiti six years after the events. Given the danger posed by gangs in Haiti, I consider it likely that if they had wanted to go after him, they could have done so between the XXXX 2017 attack and his departure on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They did not do so, which is the most important detail and is indicative of their lack of interest. The simple fact that he did not leave his home while staying with his parents is not sufficient to explain that there was no attack. It is more likely than not that already in 2017, the agents of persecution were no longer motivated to go after the male appellant. They had several months to do so, but did not.\n[31] The appellants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that their agents of persecution would have the motivation to look for them if they relocated to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. Therefore, they could live there safely.\nAn internal flight alternative in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie is unreasonable\n[32] The RPD concluded that the appellants had stated they had no problems other than with these individuals, that they stated they would have no problems moving to Port-au-Prince and that, consequently, they did not establish that the proposed IFA would be objectively unreasonable.\n[33] The appellants submit that the RPD erred in not conducting an objective analysis of the situation in Haiti, that it merely stated that Haiti is a country where many sordid and unsolved crimes unfortunately occur and that it preferred not to believe the possibility that the cousin's murder was linked to the PHTK. They submit that if they return to Haiti, the male appellant will have to work, which will put him at risk of being recognized by his assailants. They submit that the RPD did not take the time to analyze all the evidence to determine whether there is a well-founded and current fear.\n[34] Further to the RAD's notice, the appellants submit that it would be unreasonable for them to relocate to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie because of the political, economic and social context and that, to do so, they would have to fly from Montr\u00e9al to Port-au-Prince and then drive. They explain that they will have to go through the Martissant zone, an area infested by gangs that extort and loot the population, that this district of Port-au-Prince has tipped over into total chaos, a gang war, a [translation] \"lawless zone, symbol of the collapse of the state\" as headlined in a local newspaper, and that police officers have deserted the area's police stations. They submit that the cities of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Les Cayes have not been spared this insecurity. They add that the relocation of migrants returning to Haiti after a prolonged stay abroad is difficult.\n[35] I have already concluded that the RPD erred in proposing an IFA in Port-au-Prince, because it failed to take into account the documentary evidence on the situation in that city. I have proposed two other cities as IFAs, located far away from the northeastern part of the country where the appellants are from. The question now is whether it would be reasonable for them to settle there, and whether these cities are accessible.\n[36] According to the case law, the assessment of the second prong of the IFA test is based on whether, in all the circumstances, it would be reasonable for the appellants to move to the proposed IFAs, or in other words: would it be unduly harsh to expect them to move to another, less hostile part of Haiti before seeking refugee status in Canada? The burden is on the appellants to establish this.\n[37] Although the appellants have presented little or no evidence on the situation in Haiti, and in particular in the cities of Les Cayes and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, I cannot rely solely on the fact that they have not discharged their burden8 and disregard the documentary evidence in the NDP on the situation in Haiti.\n[38] According to the case law, an IFA is not speculative or theoretical, but must be a realistic, attainable option. In particular, a refugee protection claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there.9\nAn IFA cannot be speculative or theoretical only; it must be a realistic, attainable option. Essentially, this means that the alternative place of safety must be realistically accessible to the claimant. Any barriers to getting there should be reasonably surmountable. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or in staying there. For example, claimants should not be required to cross battle lines where fighting is going on at great risk to their lives in order to reach a place of safety. [emphasis added]\n[39] The appellants have established that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in XXXX due to the male appellant's imputed political opinion. Their relocation to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie is unreasonable because they cannot be required to risk their lives to reach this place of safety, given the current situation in Haiti and the control of the main roads, particularly the one leading to Martissant. The IFA is not a \"realistic, attainable\" option or \"realistically accessible\" for the appellants, given that the main roadways linking Port-au-Prince to other regions of the country are controlled by criminal gangs. This conclusion is based on the following documentary analysis:\n[40] An article dated February 202210 from The New Humanitarian news agency analyzes the impact of gang violence on the mobility of goods and people in Haiti. A map shows that the Port-au-Prince area, the airport area, is surrounded by gang-controlled zones, including the roads through Martissant to the western and southern parts of the country, where J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Les Cayes are located.11 Another map shows that the J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Les Cayes areas are served by sea due to road blockages.12\n[41] An article from March 2022 published by the Human Rights Watch organization on Haitians being returned to a country in chaos13 confirms that the road linking Port-au-Prince to Haiti's southern peninsula to the west is gang-controlled, separating the four southern provinces from the rest of the country. In July and August 2021, no fewer than 23 people were killed by gangs while driving in private vehicles in the Martissant area.14 The road passing through the Martissant neighbourhood and connecting to the south of the country has been dangerous since criminal groups have been fighting for control of the territory. With regard to sea access, it is accessible only to state employees and those with the means.15\n[42] The gang-controlled access routes are not the only aspect making IFAs elsewhere in the country realistically inaccessible. In a Response to Information Request from 2020, various sources indicate16 that migrants returning from Canada are entering gang-controlled areas and are at high risk of being kidnapped and that freedom of movement is not guaranteed because of the armed gangs. Considering the growing gang problem in Haiti in 2023, it is reasonable to think that this is still true, especially since there is an upswing in cases of kidnappings in gang-controlled areas.17\n[43] With regard to the female appellant in particular, the evidence shows that gang members commit [translation] \"opportunistic\" rapes or kidnappings of women when they are travelling on public transit in all sectors of Port-au-Prince.18\n[44] According to Haiti Situation Report: Gang-related political violence and kidnappings, January 2022,19 gang-related violence has continued to increase due to the worsening security situation and the growing power of the gangs, that kidnappings for ransom are likely to double or triple, that it has become clear that gangs will target anyone who could be used for a lucrative ransom, and that murders are likely to increase also. With regard to the movement of valuable goods, the Insecurity Insight organization recommends that humanitarian organizations plan their routes and notify key stakeholders in advance, including the gangs. According to some sources, the criminal groups are now increasingly targeting \"everyone\" since they encounter less resistance while remaining confident that the family members will endeavour to pay.20\n[45] The appellants cannot return to the XXXX area due to the risk of persecution they would face. They cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship to get to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. The NDP contains substantial evidence with regard to the risks they would face to reach the proposed IFAs; they would be risking their lives to reach a place of safety by crossing regions controlled by armed gangs, which makes an IFA in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie unreasonable.\nHaitian state protection is inadequate\n[46] The documentary evidence in the NDP21 demonstrates in a clear and convincing manner that there is no adequate protection in Haiti. The effectiveness of the police force is inadequate, given the crime rate, the lack of resources and means, and the corruption. Several sources state that the criminal groups enjoy impunity. As for the judiciary, it lacks oversight and is under the influence of criminal groups.22\n[47] State protection and political structures are inadequate and there is a rampant lack of resources to address the high crime rate throughout the country, which establishes that the appellants would not have adequate state protection in Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[48] The RPD made errors that I have corrected in this appeal. The male appellant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in XXXX because of his imputed political opinion. The female appellant is a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, and the evidence establishes that armed gangs go after the families of their targets. For these reasons, the appellants have established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to Haiti, to the XXXX area. They have no viable IFA in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie nor elsewhere in the country because of the undue risk to their lives in getting there.

The Punjab police falsely accused him of having ties to gangsters after he took in two friends suspected of gangsterism by the police. The appellant also fears for his life at the hands of the Indian police because he has joined a separatist Sikh movement (Sikhs for Justice) since arriving in Canada.\n[3] The appellant is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his refugee protection claim. He argues that the RPD erred in finding that he was not credible with respect to his profile as a separatist Sikh activist and the Punjab police's ongoing interest in him. He also argues that the RPD erred in concluding that an internal flight alternative (IFA) is available to him in New Delhi.\n[4] For the reasons set out below, I conclude that the RPD's decision is correct. The appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to some of his allegations. I also conclude that an IFA is available to him in New Delhi.\n[5] The appeal is dismissed.\nANALYSIS\n[6] I applied the correctness standard.1 As required, I conducted an independent analysis of the evidence, which included listening to the recording of the RPD hearing.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in its credibility assessment\nThe appellant's political profile\n[7] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant failed to demonstrate that, if he returned to India, he would be politically active regarding Khalistan or that he would face a risk of persecution by reason of his political opinion.\n[8] The appellant argues that his failure to spontaneously mention that he fears returning to India because of his support for Khalistan is not as egregious as the RPD described. He submits that the RPD erred in relying on the omission to make a negative credibility finding. He adds that the RPD did not provide adequate reasons for its finding and that its decision is not transparent.\n[9] I disagree.\n[10] I am of the opinion that the RPD's reasons are clear and explain why the RPD concluded that the appellant did not demonstrate that he truly intends to support Khalistan if he returns to India. The RPD relied on the appellant's failure to mention during his testimony that he fears returning to India because he is a Khalistan supporter. The RPD also relied on contradictions in the appellant's testimony as to when he became a Khalistan supporter and whether he was merely a supporter or a member of an organization.\n[11] I also conducted my own independent analysis of the evidence. For the reasons set out below, I conclude that the appellant did not demonstrate that he is politically active in a separatist Sikh movement or that he will be perceived as such if he returns to India.\nFailure to mention that he fears returning because of his political opinion\n[12] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in making a negative credibility finding based on the appellant's failure to mention during his testimony that he also fears returning to India because he supports Khalistan, a movement seeking the creation of an independent Sikh state.\n[13] I am of the opinion that, contrary to what the appellant argues, his failure to spontaneously mention his pro-Khalistan activism at the hearing when he was asked why he fears returning to India constitutes a major omission.\n[14] Approximately ten (10) days before his RPD hearing, the appellant took the opportunity to make additions to his Basis of Claim Form2 (BOC Form). In this addendum, he states that he is a Khalistan supporter. At the same time, the appellant also submitted documents described as evidence of his pro-Khalistan activities,3 namely, photographs showing him with other individuals of the Sikh faith4 and a voter card for the referendum on Khalistan issued by the Sikhs for Justice organization.5\n[15] However, when the RPD asked him whether there were any reasons other than the false accusations of ties to gangsters why the police might arrest him if he returned to India, the appellant simply stated that Sikhs in India are considered terrorists. When the RPD asked him to explain why the police considers them to be terrorists, the appellant stated that it was because of the Hindu government, which despises Sikhs, makes false accusations against them and imprisons them.6 At no point did the appellant mention that he is a Khalistan supporter or that he will be targeted for that reason if he returns to India.\n[16] I have taken into consideration that the appellant expressed a fear of returning to India because of how Sikhs are treated by the Indian government. I will come back to this. That said, it should be noted that there is a difference between a fear of returning based on religion, namely, the practice of Sikhism, and one based on a separatist political opinion. Although one does not exclude the other, not all Sikhs advocate for Khalistan.7\n[17] However, it was only when the RPD pointed out to him that, in his addendum to the BOC Form, he states that he is a supporter of Khalistan that the appellant confirmed that he fears returning to India for that reason as well. When the RPD asked why he had not spontaneously mentioned this, the appellant's response was vague and evasive. At first, he stated that he had not been able to say so. He added that the police had harassed him a great deal and that he feared them. The RPD had to press for an answer to its question. Again, the appellant did not answer the question. Instead, he stated that he has been pro-Khalistan since arriving in Canada. When again asked to explain the omission, the appellant stated that he found out about it later and repeated the reasons that led him to leave India.8\n[18] I draw a negative inference from the appellant's vague and evasive testimony.\n[19] I have also taken into account that, according to the appellant's testimony later during the hearing, the police in India kill Khalistan supporters, that he himself is prepared to die for his political opinion and that he is very involved in the movement in Canada.9\n[20] In this context, I would have expected the appellant to spontaneously state that he feared returning to India because he is a Khalistan supporter. However, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that his credibility is greatly undermined with respect to his allegations that he actively supports Khalistan and that he would support it if he returned to India.\nContradictions regarding the circumstances surrounding his political activities\n[21] I am also of the opinion that the RPD did not err in making negative credibility findings based on the contradictions as to when the appellant became a Khalistan supporter and whether he was a mere supporter or a member of a pro-Khalistan organization.\n[22] According to his BOC Form, the appellant is a Khalistan supporter.10\n[23] As the RPD noted, the appellant's testimony was contradictory as to when he became a Khalistan supporter. His testimony was also contradictory with respect to his status, that is, whether he is a supporter or a member of a pro-Khalistan organization. When asked to explain the contradictions, the appellant adjusted his testimony more than once.\n[24] At the RPD hearing, the appellant stated that he has been a Khalistan supporter since 2019.11 Later during the hearing, the appellant stated that he became a supporter after attending a pro-Khalistan rally in 2018 in Surrey, British Columbia.12 He then stated that he had taken part in the rally because he is pro-Khalistan. The appellant later adjusted his testimony. He stated that he became a supporter when he moved to Cambridge, Ontario. When the RPD asked him to explain the contradiction, the appellant stated that he fully supported Khalistan after his arrival in Ontario. The appellant later adjusted his testimony to state that he became an active member after 2019. He explained that to become a member, he had obtained an identity card that allowed him to vote. The appellant had trouble specifying which organization he had become a member of. He first stated that he was a member of Khalistan and that he had obtained an identity card13 to that effect. When asked to specify the organization in which the identity card confers membership, the appellant stated the creation of Khalistan. When confronted with the fact that the card was issued by the Sikhs for Justice organization, the appellant stated that the goal was the creation of Khalistan. When asked whether he is a member of Sikhs for Justice, the appellant answered in the affirmative. When asked to explain why he had not mentioned this earlier, the appellant stated because the RPD had not asked him.14 I am of the opinion that the RPD's questions as to which organization the appellant had become a member of were clear and unambiguous.\n[25] According to the appellant's testimony, after 2019, he became particularly active in the Khalistan movement, notably by encouraging other Sikhs in Canada to join the movement. In such circumstances and in a context where the appellant is seeking protection because of his political activities, among other things, I would have expected the appellant to be able to state clearly when he joined the movement, what his status was, that is, whether he was a mere supporter or a member, and the name of the organization of which he had allegedly become a member.\n[26] In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that the appellant's credibility is further undermined with respect to his political profile.\n[27] I took into consideration the voter card issued by Sikhs for Justice.15 Considering that the appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to his political profile, I give no probative value to the document to corroborate the appellant's allegations that he took part in pro-Khalistan rallies.\n[28] There is no evidence before me that such a voter card is issued solely to people taking part in pro-Khalistan rallies. All that the voter card establishes is that it was issued to the appellant so that he can vote in a referendum.\n[29] I have taken into consideration that the recent documentary evidence shows that the Indian authorities monitor Khalistan activists abroad, such as at rallies and on social media.16 However, the appellant did not demonstrate that he has this profile.\n[30] Furthermore, the objective documentary evidence17 does not establish that the mere fact of obtaining a voter card issued by Sikhs for Justice could come to the attention of the Indian authorities.\n[31] I took into consideration the photographs submitted by the appellant to demonstrate that he had taken part in pro-Khalistan activities.18 However, I see nothing in those photographs that provides a basis to conclude that the appellant had attended one or more pro-Khalistan rallies. The photographs merely show the appellant with other individuals wearing Sikh religious symbols. I accept that, in Canada, the appellant spends time with other people who practise Sikhism. That being said, the photographs are insufficient to corroborate the appellant's political activities. Consequently, I grant them no probative value to corroborate the appellant's allegations that he advocates for Khalistan in Canada.\n[32] In light of all the foregoing, I find that the appellant's credibility was undermined as to his allegations of pro-Khalistan activism in Canada. I also find that his credibility was undermined with respect to his allegations that he would advocate for Khalistan if he returned to India. Although the appellant obtained a voter card allowing him to vote in a referendum on Khalistan, the appellant did not demonstrate that this evidence alone provides a basis to conclude that he had come to the attention of the Indian authorities because of his political opinion.\n[33] Consequently, I conclude that the appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution by reason of his real or perceived political profile or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) if he returned to India.\nOngoing interest of the police\n[34] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in finding that the appellant's credibility was undermined as to his allegations that the XXXX XXXX police are still looking for him.\n[35] The appellant argues that the RPD erred in giving no weight to the affidavits of his brother and a municipal councillor, which state that the police are still looking for him.19 He also seems to argue that the RPD erred when it rejected his explanations that he was no longer in contact with his brother and that he has very recently reconnected with his cousin.\n[36] I conducted my own analysis.\n[37] I note that it was only around ten (10) days before the hearing that the appellant added to his BOC Form that his brother had told him in XXXX 2022 that the police were still looking for him and even visited the home of a family member to find out his whereabouts.20 However, at the RPD hearing, the appellant stated that he had been in touch with his brother approximately twice a month from the time he arrived in Canada in 2017 to 2022. In his conversations with his brother, his brother told him that the police were still looking for him, were harassing the family and wanted money. According to his testimony, the police initially visited two or three times per month. Later, it was monthly.21\n[38] However, in the first version of his BOC Form drafted in 2019,22 two years after his arrival in Canada, the appellant does not mention those numerous police visits. When asked to explain the omission, the appellant's response was vague and evasive, that, essentially, the police had never stopped looking for him. When the RPD pressed for an answer, the appellant stated that he did not know that he had to include that information in his BOC Form.23 I draw a negative inference from the vague and evasive testimony. I am of the opinion that the explanation is not satisfactory. The appellant was represented by counsel when he completed his BOC Form. He completed it nearly two years after arriving in Canada. Consequently, I am of the opinion that he had time to prepare himself. The police's constant harassment of family members is important information. It serves to demonstrate that even two years after the appellant's departure, the police were still actively looking for him.\n[39] In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that the appellant's credibility is greatly undermined as to his allegations of the police's ongoing interest.\n[40] I took into consideration the affidavits24 submitted by the appellant.\n[41] In his affidavit, the appellant's cousin states that he was contacted by the appellant's brother in 2017 who was seeking financial help.25 He then states that the police raided his home in search of the appellant.\n[42] At the RPD hearing, the appellant stated that he recently re-established contact with a cousin in India. The appellant was asked to explain what his cousin told him about the police. The appellant stated that his cousin told him that the police claim that he is a terrorist and that they are looking for him.26 The appellant made no mention of the raid in either his testimony or his BOC Form, which, in my view, is a major incident demonstrating the police's motivation. In addition, I am of the opinion that the appellant could not be unaware of that information because it is in his own documentary evidence.\n[43] When asked to explain the omission, the appellant's response was again vague and evasive. He testified that his cousin knew that the police were involved, that he did not know that they had gone to his home, but that he found out about it when he asked him for an affidavit.27 In my view, the appellant's explanation does not answer the question of why he failed to mention during his testimony that the police had raided his cousin's home.\n[44] In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that the credibility of the affidavit is undermined. Furthermore, even if I accepted that the police had visited the appellant's cousin, the affidavit suggests that the incident happened in 2017. More than five (5) years have since passed. Consequently, the document is not sufficient to corroborate that the XXXX XXXXpolice are still looking for the appellant.\n[45] I also considered the XXXX XXXXmunicipal councillor's affidavit.28 He states that he was involved in the appellant's release in 2017. He also states that approximately two months before the drafting of his affidavit, the police had come to see him to question him about the appellant. However, considering that the appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to the police's continuing interest more than five years after he left India, I am of the opinion that the affidavit is insufficient to corroborate the appellant's allegations that the police are still looking for him.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in concluding that an internal flight alternative is available in New Delhi\n[46] The IFA assessment is based on a two-pronged test. For the first prong, the refugee protection claimant must establish a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA in the proposed IFAs. For the second prong, the refugee protection claimant must demonstrate that it would be objectively unreasonable for him to seek refuge in the proposed IFAs.\nThe appellant did not demonstrate that there is a prospective risk in New Delhi\n[47] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the XXXX XXXXpolice in Punjab has the motivation to locate him in New Delhi. Consequently, I conclude that the appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution in New Delhi or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA in that location.\n[48] The appellant argues that the RPD erred in concluding that the XXXX XXXXpolice would not be motivated to look for him all the way to New Delhi. He submits that even if the police released him after receiving a bribe, extortion might be a motive for the XXXX XXXXpolice to conduct interstate searches to find him.\n[49] However, as mentioned above, the appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to his allegations of the police's continuing interest. The appellant did not demonstrate that the XXXX XXXXpolice have been interested in him since he left India in November 2017, over five years ago. The appellant does not allege that charges were officially laid against him. The appellant submitted no credible evidence that the police have been looking for him since he left India.\n[50] Consequently, regardless of the tenant verification system in India, given the passage of time and the absence of credible evidence that the police are still looking for him, I am of the opinion that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the police are still interested in him and that it has an interest in looking for him in New Delhi and the motivation to do so.\n[51] I also took into consideration how Sikhs are treated in New Delhi. I conclude that the appellant did not demonstrate that the treatment of Sikhs in New Delhi amounts to persecution.\n[52] As mentioned above, I am of the view that the appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to his allegations that he would face a risk of persecution in India because he openly supports Khalistan.\n[53] With respect to how Sikhs are treated, at the RPD hearing, the appellant testified that Sikhs in India are perceived as terrorists.\n[54] The objective documentary evidence29 mentions a rise in religious extremism in India, as well as waves of violence and religious persecution targeting religious minorities, including Sikhs, particularly pro-Khalistan supporters and activists. That said, the appellant did not demonstrate that he is a pro-Khalistan activist or that he is perceived as such. I am of the opinion that the evidence is insufficient to conclude that he risks being targeted in New Delhi because he is Sikh. The appellant is not a Sikh activist. He did not demonstrate that he is a real supporter of a political party advocating for Khalistan. According to the recent documentary evidence specifically on the treatment of Sikhs in India, most Sikhs living outside of Punjab generally do not have problems integrating economically and socially.30\n[55] I have also taken into consideration that the appellant previously lived and worked in New Delhi for around nineteen (19) years, until 2016.31 Although he states that he lost his job because someone paid to have his position, the appellant does not allege having had problems in New Delhi because he is of the Sikh faith.\n[56] In light of the foregoing and after considering all the evidence, I conclude that the appellant failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA in New Delhi.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in concluding that it is not unreasonable for the appellant to seek refuge in New Delhi\n[57] The threshold for demonstrating that an IFA is unreasonable is very high. The conditions in the IFA must be such that the life or safety of the claimant would be at risk.32 I am of the opinion that the appellant did not discharge that burden.\n[58] The appellant argues that the RPD erred when it failed to explain why it accepted certain pieces of objective evidence over others. He adds that the RPD did not examine the documentary evidence in detail, including that which he had put forward. The appellant provides no other details about the documentary evidence that the RPD allegedly disregarded.\n[59] That said, I note that the counsel representing the appellant before the RPD referred to the objective documentary evidence on the treatment of people perceived as pro-Khalistan activists.33 However, as mentioned above, the appellant did not demonstrate that he has that profile.\n[60] At the RPD hearing, other than his fear of the XXXX XXXXpolice, the appellant mentioned no other reasons that would constitute an obstacle to his relocation. According to the appellant's testimony, the only reason why he could not live in New Delhi was that the police were looking for him. When asked by the RPD whether there were any other reasons that would prevent him from settling in New Delhi, the appellant answered in the negative.34\n[61] As mentioned above, the appellant does not allege that he had any problems when he was living in New Delhi.\n[62] The appellant is a 59-year-old man. He does not allege having health problems that would prevent him from working. I have taken into consideration that the appellant speaks only Punjabi. That said, Punjabi is among the predominant languages in Delhi, which includes New Delhi.35\n[63] In my view, the appellant did not demonstrate that he would be unable to support or house himself in New Delhi, a district of India's national capital.36\n[64] I have also taken into consideration that the appellant is of the Sikh faith. As mentioned above, according to the recent documentary evidence, most Sikhs living outside of Punjab generally live in safety, are not subjected to social discrimination or violence, and are able to integrate economically and socially.37 Delhi also has a large Sikh community.38\n[65] In light of the foregoing, and after considering all the evidence, I conclude that the RPD's decision is correct. The appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution on any of the five Convention grounds nor did he demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, should he return to India.\nDECISION\n[66] I dismiss the appeal. I confirm the determination of the RPD that XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMarie-Lyne Thibault\nMarie-Lyne Thibault\nAugust 21, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He is neither a Convention1 refugee nor a person in need of protection. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) correctly found Mr. XXXX has an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Merida, Mexico. On a balance of probabilities, Mr. XXXX will not face a risk of torture, to life, or of cruel and unusual punishment in Merida. It is also not unduly harsh for Mr. XXXX to move there.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The following is a summary of allegations as contained in Mr. XXXX Basis of Claim (BOC) form and submissions:\na) Mr. XXXX is a citizen of Mexico and nowhere else. He fears the cartel de XXXX XXXX (XXXX XXXX). Mr. XXXX completed most of his education as an XXXX. He was hired by a group to securely rebuild a bodega. After completing the project, the same people asked him to build secret passages in other buildings. Mr. XXXX learned the people belonged to XXXX XXXX and he refused the work.\nb) Because of his refusal, XXXX XXXX kidnapped Mr. XXXX, beat, and tortured him. They returned Mr. XXXX to his home saying they would return. When they returned, Mr. XXXX asked for more time to decide so they took him to a ranch and beat him again. They threatened him and his family. In speaking with a cab driver, Mr. XXXX found out XXXX XXXX put a XXXX XXXX bounty out for his capture. The bounty was because they thought he assisted in the arrest of their boss (XXXX XXXX). Mr. XXXX sold his possessions and fled to Canada.\nRPD decision\n[3] The RPD dismissed Mr. XXXX claim for the following reasons:\na) Mr. XXXX has an IFA in either Culiacan or Merida;\nb) Mr. XXXX failed to provide documents corroborating his story;\nc) The XXXX XXXX bounty alleged for Mr. XXXX capture or death was not believable;\nd) XXXX XXXX is a splinter faction with a local scope. The Sinaloa cartel controls Culiacan excluding all others; XXXX XXXX lacks either the means or motivation to track Mr. XXXX in Culiacan or Merida;\ne) Mr. XXXX fear of violence in Culiacan is a generalized risk; Merida is one of the safest locations in Mexico; it is not unreasonable for Mr. XXXX to move to either.\nMr. XXXX submissions on appeal\n[4] Mr. XXXX argues the RPD was incorrect for the following reasons:\na) The RPD misapprehended the evidence. Mr. XXXX explained the bounty wasn't real, it was only meant to persuade him to work. The RPD wrongly required evidence of the bounty on his head;\nb) Mr. XXXX isn't pursued because XXXX XXXX think he is responsible for XXXX XXXX's arrest. It is because he refused to build their secret hideouts. People in Mr. XXXX town told him that everyone who builds the hideouts are murdered so they can't reveal it;\nc) XXXX XXXX is a sophisticated cartel working with other cartels like XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX has a personalized risk in both IFAs;\nd) The RPD ignored relevant evidence, including a letter from Mr. XXXX friend.\nANALYSIS\n[5] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 The RPD correctly found Mr. XXXX failed to demonstrate a nexus to a Convention refugee ground. It also correctly found Mr. XXXX has an IFA in Merida. He presented insufficient evidence demonstrating XXXX XXXX can and will track him in Merida. Given Mr. XXXX skills, it would not be unduly harsh for him to relocate there.\nMr. XXXX is credible\n[6] I find Mr. XXXX credible about his claims. His testimony was consistent with his BOC. It had no errors, omissions or inconsistencies. I see no reason to rebut the presumption of truthfulness in Mr. XXXX testimony.\n[7] The RPD doubted Mr. XXXX credibility without providing clear examples of why the presumption of truthfulness in his testimony was rebutted. 3 Instead, it placed seeds of doubt about Mr. XXXX claim before moving on to IFA. The RPD explained that Mr. XXXX demeanor was halting, hesitant and vague.4 Demeanour evidence is unreliable and insufficient as a sole basis of finding a person lacks credibility. Mr. XXXX explained that he struggled with his recollection and did not have the money to pay for therapy or a psychologist.5 The RPD did not assess the reasonableness of this explanation. Instead, it noted that Mr. XXXX failed to produce corroborating medical documentation for his trauma. A claimant's testimony is presumed to be true, with or without corroboration.\n[8] The RPD found Mr. XXXX not credible because he did not provide corroborating evidence of XXXX XXXX's arrest. A lack of corroborating documents alone is insufficient to doubt Mr. XXXX credibility. The RPD cited a Federal Court decision which, in fact, confirms that the absence of documentary evidence alone is insufficient to doubt a person's credibility.6 To be clear, the RPD could have asked what efforts Mr. XXXX had made to obtain documentation and decided on credibility because it rejected his explanation. The RPD did no such thing. In the hearing, it asked Mr. XXXX if he tried to find any news articles about XXXX XXXX's arrest. Mr. XXXX responded no because any time he thought about it he would go to bed and be unable to get up. The RPD did not assess this explanation, instead finding against Mr. XXXX credibility because he did not provide documentation.\n[9] Finally, the RPD wrote that it was not credible that a Mexican cartel would place a XXXX XXXX bounty for Mr. XXXX capture. This is an implausibility finding using the language of credibility. The RPD did not believe it was plausible the cartel would put such a high bounty for Mr. XXXX.\n[10] Implausibility findings should only be made in the clearest of cases.7 Mr. XXXX explained the bounty was because they blamed him for the arrest of their boss.8 While the amount is extreme, I find it plausible. It is important to note that Mr. XXXX explained in testimony the bounty wasn't real. XXXX XXXX only made it to add pressure and make his problems bigger.9 The relevance of the oversized bounty simply to add pressure (rather than create a significant motivation for anyone to kill Mr. XXXX) becomes particularly important in the analysis below on IFA.\n[11] The RPD also failed to apply a trauma-informed approach to questioning Mr. XXXX about his experiences.10 Mr. XXXX explained at the outset of the hearing that he felt his experiences were traumatic.11 He explained XXXX XXXX tortured him by placing a towel over his face and pouring water to simulate drowning (also known as water boarding).12 He added that he did not have the money for counseling or therapy.13\n[12] Whether the Member intended to or not, it diminished Mr. XXXX experience by asking \"So, you were just beaten by them? [emphasis added]\"14 When Mr. XXXX testified XXXX XXXX placed a bounty for him, the Member asked \"if [the bounty] is just a rumor then why does it worry you so much?\"15 Mr. XXXX explained it was because they almost killed him already. The RPD's lack of sensitivity to Mr. XXXX assault and torture is reflected in its reasons as described above. It plants a seed of doubt about Mr. XXXX experiences without coming to a clear conclusion on credibility.\nMr. XXXX has an IFA in Merida\n[13] Mr. XXXX has an IFA in Merida. On a balance of probabilities, he will not face a risk to life, cruel and unusual punishment, or torture. It is also not unduly harsh to expect Mr. XXXX to relocate to Merida.\n[14] There is a two-part test to determine if there is an IFA. The IFA must be safe and it must be reasonable. An IFA is safe if there is no likely risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture. In assessing safety, the agent of persecution's motivation and means to find Mr. XXXX are considered. An IFA is reasonable if conditions are not unduly harsh and do not jeopardize the life and safety of the appellant.\nMr. XXXX will not face a risk in Merida\n[15] On a balance of probabilities, Mr. XXXX will not face a risk to life, cruel and unusual punishment, or torture in Merida. Mr. XXXX failed to provide sufficient evidence XXXX XXXX has either the means or the motivation to track him in Merida. It is not sufficient to argue that it is a short flight. In establishing it is more likely he will face harm than not, Mr. XXXX must provide sufficient evidence that XXXX XXXX has influence, alliances or some means that they could act in Merida.\n[16] The RPD correctly pointed out the limited mention of XXXX XXXX in the National Documentation Package (NDP). XXXX XXXX is a splinter faction from the XXXX cartel16 or XXXX XXXX cartel.17 The country evidence suggests that it operates primarily in Guerrero and Morelos (and 'other' states).18 The NDP does not mention Yucatan, the state in which Merida is located, as a state where XXXX XXXX operates or has influence. Since it is a splinter faction, XXXX XXXX does not communicate with nor does it have the resources of other factions.19\n[17] Mr. XXXX testimony is presumed to be true, but this does not extend to speculation. He speculates that XXXX XXXX will continue to look for him anywhere in Mexico. If XXXX XXXX seriously believed he was responsible for the capture of their boss, it may constitute a personal vendetta which XXXX XXXX would pursue.20 Mr. XXXX testified Los Rojos did not seriously consider he was instrumental in his arrest. Similarly, Mr. XXXX testified the oversized bounty was not created for people to pursue him. It was to add pressure for him to do further work on their behalf.\n[18] Mr. XXXX relies on item 7.18 in the NDP to suggest XXXX XXXX works with other cartels with an ability to track people across Mexico.21 I find no part of item 7.18 supports Mr. XXXX position.22 It does, however, reinforce that cartels are increasingly fragmented into gangs (like XXXX XXXX) who compete, rather than cooperate.23 It also suggests (in addition to other NDP documentation already referred to above) that politicians, journalists, police officers, and indigenous communities are likely to be targeted by cartels.24 Mr. XXXX does not fit any of these profiles.\n[19] The first prong of the IFA test in this case is on a balance of probabilities. It must be more likely than not that Mr. XXXX will face a risk to life, torture, or cruel and unusual punishment. On an independent basis, I find Mr. XXXX has failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate he would face such a risk, on a balance of probabilities.\nIt is not unduly harsh for Mr. XXXX to move to Merida\n[20] It is not unduly harsh for Mr. XXXX to move to Merida. The RPD correctly laid out the criteria for the second prong of the IFA test. I adopt its reasons for the second prong of IFA as my own. Mr. XXXX is well educated, with experience as an XXXX, in XXXX, and XXXX XXXX work. Although Mr. XXXX fears general crime in the proposed IFAs, this is not a sufficient basis to make it unduly harsh. Mr. XXXX failed to present sufficient language, health, work, religious, housing or other reasons which would make Merida unduly harsh.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD correctly found XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nCraig Mracek\nCraig Mracek\nJanuary 10, 2023\nDate\n1 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, Geneva, 28 July 1951, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 189, at p. 137 and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, New York, 31 January 1967, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 606, at p. 267; accession of Canada to both on 4 June 1969.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of China.\n[2] The Appellant suffered back pain that was resistant to medical treatment and traditional Chinese medicine. After a friend told him that Falun Gong had improved his life, the Appellant began to practise Falun Gong at home, and his condition improved. Several months later, the Appellant joined a group practice. In XXXX 2018, the group leader advised the Appellant and others to go into hiding because two members of the group had been arrested for distributing flyers. The Appellant hired a smuggler who assisted him to travel to Canada. After he arrived in Canada, the Appellant learned that the Public Security Bureau (PSB) had come to his home to look for him and left a summons for him with his wife.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the PSB summons was not authentic because it appeared that the text was written over the stamps, and there was no coercive summons issued even though the Appellant did not comply with the summons. The RPD found that it was not plausible that the PSB were pursuing the Appellant so aggressively but had not harassed his family members and because he was able to exit China unimpeded. In addition, the RPD found that the Appellant omitted material information from his Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative without reasonable explanation. The RPD further found that the Appellant failed to obtain corroborative documentation about his Falun Gong practice in China and the PSB's pursuit of him and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a sur place claim.\n[4] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding that the summons is not authentic as the summons is consistent with country documentation. The Appellant also argues that the RPD's findings regarding a lack of coercive summons, that the Appellant's family has not been harassed and his ability to exit China are based on speculation as to the actions of Chinese authorities. The Appellant further argues that the RPD exaggerated the nature of the omission from his BOC narrative. Finally, the Appellant argues that the RPD's sur place finding is in error because it is based on its erroneous credibility findings regarding his practice of Falun Gong in China.\n[5] The determinative issue is credibility.\n[6] The RPD did err in engaging in speculative reasoning about the lack of a coercive summons, that Chinese authorities would harass the Appellant's family and his ability to exit China on his own passport. However, the RPD did not err in finding that the summons is inauthentic, that the omission from the Appellant's BOC narrative and inconsistent testimony about his wife and parents being taken to the PSB station were not reasonably explained and that the Appellant failed to provide corroborative documentation. The RPD was correct to consider that the Appellant's evidence about practising Falun Gong in China was not credible when assessing the Appellant's sur place claim.\nDECISION\n[7] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[8] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1 Having reviewed the record, including the original summons as well as the transcript of the hearing, I find that the RPD did not enjoy a meaningful advantage in assessing credibility. As a result, I am conducting my review on the standard of correctness.\nRPD's findings not in dispute\nSur place claim\n[9] The Appellant does not dispute the RPD's finding that he does not have a sur place claim, as there is no evidence that his Falun Gong activities in Canada have come to the attention of Chinese authorities. I have independently assessed the record and reviewed the transcript of the hearing and find no error in the RPD's finding.\nFailure to obtain corroborative documentation\n[10] The Appellant has not disputed the RPD's finding that the Appellant failed to provide corroborative documentation about his Falun Gong practice in China and the PSB's pursuit of him as well as his fellow Falun Gong practitioners from his wife, parents, aunt and uncle, and the family members of WJ and Mr. Z who remain in detention.\n[11] I have independently assessed the record and reviewed the transcript of the hearing. Given the negative credibility findings that are discussed below and that the Appellant did not provide any reason why he did not attempt to obtain corroborative documentation, I find no error in the RPD's finding.\nThe PSB summons is not genuine\n[12] The Appellant argues that the summons conforms to country documentation and that it is possible that it appears that the text is typed over the red seals because the red ink is not opaque. I disagree. I do, however, agree with the Appellant that the use of a coercive summons is not mandatory under the law; it is a discretionary action that Chinese authorities may employ.2 The RPD's reasoning in this respect is faulty.\n[13] The authenticity of a foreign document is presumed unless there are reasons for doubting that it is a reliable document. In my independent assessment, I note several discrepancies as well as inconsistencies with the country documentation.\n[14] Based on my assessment of the original summons, I concur with the RPD's observation that the text of the summons appears to be printed over the red stamps, rather than the stamps stamped over the text.\n[15] The summons refers to \"Article Eighty Two in the Regulations of the <<Public Security Administrative Punishment Law of the People's Republic of China>>\" [emphasis added].3 I note that there are no regulations in the Public Security Administration Punishments Law.4 I also note that the samples provided of summonses in the country documentation make no reference to regulations; rather, they refer only to Article 82 and the title of the law is referred to as the \"Public Security Administrative Punishments Law of the People's Republic of China.\"5 [emphasis added].\n[16] In addition, the country documentation indicates that a summons contains a warning about evading the summons,6 which is found in the two samples: \"Persons who refuse or evade a summons for no legitimate reason shall be subject to a mandatory summons in accordance with the law.\"7 The summons submitted by the Appellant does not contain this warning. I also note that the title and the case number reference are inconsistent with country documentation and the samples. The titles in the samples are \"Summons Notice\", but the title in the Appellant's summons is \"Notice of Summoning\". A Visiting Professor indicated that:\nthe case number listed on a summons notice is preceded by an abbreviation unique to the specific PSB office in question and the year of the summons (Visiting Professor XXXX XXXX. 2021). According to instructions accompanying the 2019 MPS template collection, the part of the document that reads [translation] \"'X-Gong-( )-Zi [ ] No.', shall be written according to the following requirements\":\nThe 'X': is to be replaced with the abbreviated name of the public security authority that is producing the legal document. The '( )' is to contain the abbreviation of the name of the unit of the public security authority that is responsible for handling the case; the operational departments including public security administration, border defence, immigration administration, traffic administration, and online security and protection may be abbreviated to Zhi, Bian, Jing, Jiao and Wang respectively; the abbreviated name of the police substation may be used in this section. The '[ ]' is to contain the year. The 'No.' is to contain the running serial number. (China [2019]a, 6)8\n[17] In contrast, the summons provided by the Appellant contains the following case number reference: \"XXXX XXXX XXXX (Security) XXXX Summoned Record [2018] No XXXX\".\n[18] Based on these discrepancies and inconsistencies, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the summons is not genuine, and I give it no weight.\n[19] The submission of a non-genuine document has a significant impact on the general credibility of the Appellant, as he has shown that he is willing to use a non-genuine document and hold it out as genuine. In addition, the summons, which was meant to corroborate that the PSB are looking for him, puts into doubt a central element of his claim. I am also of the view that the Appellant's submission of a non-genuine document raises doubts as to the trustworthiness of the Appellant's remaining evidence. I draw negative inferences for all of these reasons.\nOmission and inconsistent testimony about family members being taken to PSB station are not reasonably explained\n[20] The Appellant argues that the RPD exaggerated the extent of the omission from his BOC narrative and the inconsistency in his testimony about his parents and wife attending the PSB station; however, the Appellant does not dispute the omission from his BOC narrative nor that his testimony was inconsistent. I find no error in the RPD's conclusion that the inconsistencies and the omission are not reasonably explained.\n[21] In his BOC narrative, the Appellant stated that the PSB went to his home and the home of his aunt and uncle, but he made no reference to anyone going to the PSB station:\n9. After arrived in Canada, I learned from wife that the PSB come my home to search me\non XXXX XXXX, 2018. They interrogated my wife and my parents about my Falun Gong\nactives and about where I am. My wife declined about FaLun Gong activities, The PSB told\nher that they already caught my friend [WJ] and our leader [Mr. Z] from where\nthey were hiding, and PSB want me to surrender myself to them immediately. As I failed\nto submitted myself, they came back on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and left a summon with my\nwife. After that, they also went to my aunt and uncle's home to search me.9\n[22] At the beginning of the RPD hearing, the Appellant confirmed that his narrative was complete, true and accurate. He testified that the PSB \"just go [to my home] to check whether I cam home or not, because they didn't know that I left China.\"10 He also testified that the PSB had come to his parents' home as well. When asked why he did not indicate in his BOC narrative that the PSB had come to his parents' home, the Appellant stated:\nCLAIMANT: So that time I just generally mentioned police went to search for me and I forgot to put down the time. It was later on my wife told me that they also went to my parents' home and didn't tell me when. And then later on when we chat then she told me when and went to where.11\n[23] The Appellant was then asked directly whether anyone who was interrogated by the PSB about him had been taken down to PSB headquarters, and he answered no. The RPD then sought clarification, and the Appellant's testimony evolved to say that his wife and parents had been taken to the PSB station:\nMEMBER 2: Do you have any explanation for why there hasn't been more extensive interrogation efforts made to try to locate you?\nCLAIMANT: Police didn't go to anybody else home to check on me, didn't go to any friends' home. Only they went to my relatives' home. Sorry that maybe I didn't understand your question before.\nMEMBER 2: Again, just to clarify. What you're saying is that all of the efforts that the PCB (sic) have made - PSB, forgive me - all the efforts that the PSB has made has basically involved just going to people's homes, asking a few questions and leaving.\nCLAIMANT: No. They just took my wife and my parents to the station, asked them before.\nMEMBER 3: Excuse me; they took your wife and your parents to the station.\nCLAIMANT: Yes, they asked them before.12\n[24] When asked why he did not include this information in his narrative, the Appellant stated that he thought he had included it, but maybe he had forgotten to do so.\n[25] I do not find the Appellant's explanation to be reasonable. In my view, the inconsistencies in the Appellant's testimony about whether any family members had been required to attend the PSB station and his omission from his BOC narrative that the PSB had attended his parents' home and that his parents and wife were taken to the PSB station relate to material elements of his allegation that the PSB are pursuing him based on his Falun Gong practice. I find no error in the RPD's finding that the omissions and inconsistent testimony are not reasonably explained, and I concur in drawing a negative inference on that basis.\n[26] Given the Appellant's submission of an inauthentic summons as well as the omissions and inconsistent testimony about the PSB, all of which relate to central elements of his claim, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant did not practise Falun Gong in China, and he was not pursued by the PSB for practising Falun Gong in China nor did the PSB issue a summons to him.\nAdditional arguments\n[27] I agree with the Appellant that the RPD's findings regarding the lack of harassment of his family is speculative as is the RPD's reasoning about the Appellant's exit from China using his own passport. These errors are not determinative, given the above-noted significant negative credibility findings.\nSur place claim\n[28] The Appellant argues that the RPD's conclusion regarding his sur place claim is in error because it is based entirely on erroneous credibility findings that the Appellant did not practise Falun Gong in China. I disagree.\n[29] The Federal Court has made clear that credibility findings can be imported into sur place claim assessments.13 The RPD correctly considered the finding that the Appellant did not, on a balance of probabilities, practise Falun Gong in China and was not pursued by the PSB.\n[30] The RPD noted that the Appellant's Falun Gong practice is tied exclusively to his alleged Falun Gong practice in China, which he began because his back pain could not be successfully treated. I have considered, as the RPD did, the photographs and the letter from the Appellant's fellow Falun Gong practitioners. The photographs are undated. The letter from SF states that he met the Appellant in XXXX 2019 while practicing in the XXXX XXXX and that he has practised with the Appellant and participated in the parade of Falun Gong with him. The letter does not provide any specifics such as dates or places other than when SF initially met the Appellant. The letter from SQ states that he met the Appellant on XXXX XXXX, 2019 when he participated in a parade and that, after that, they practise and distribute leaflets together often.\n[31] I find that this evidence does not overcome the credibility concerns. In particular, the Appellant's BOC narrative states that his medical condition was not successfully treated in China. His practice of Falun Gong in China improved his condition and was the basis for him leaving China and continuing his practice in Canada. The Appellant's alleged practice in China is directly linked to the sincerity of his practice in Canada as is his allegation that he was pursued by the PSB because of his practice of Falun Gong. As such, my findings that the Appellant was not credible about these allegations raises significant doubt about the genuineness of his practice of Falun Gong in Canada. When I weigh these findings, along with the lack of corroborative evidence, I find that the Appellant's knowledge of Falun Gong, and the photographs and the letters attesting to his practice are insufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant is a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong.\n[32] Recent caselaw confirms that this analysis is reasonable. In Wu, the applicant argued that the finding that he was not a practising Christian in China was not relevant to whether he was a genuine practitioner in Canada. The Federal Court did not find this argument compelling:\n[15] Mr. XXXX relies on two judgments of this Court in support of the argument that his lack of participation in a Christian church in China is irrelevant to his sur place claim: Chen v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 749 at para 58; Huang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 205 at para 32. In those cases, the Court states that the fact a refugee claimant was not a genuine practitioner of a particular religion in their country of origin does not mean the claimant has not become a practitioner since arriving in Canada.\n[16] In my opinion, there is no inconsistency between the RAD's analysis and the Court's analysis in the two cases. The RAD did not determine Mr. XXXX's sur place claim on the basis that he did not practice Christianity in China. Rather, the panel found that his explanation of the development of his interest in the religion was not credible. The RAD's analysis is similar to that of another RAD panel that was before me for review in Han v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 858 (Han). Ms. XXXX had stated that her Christian practice in Canada was a continuation of her involvement in China (Han at para 43):\n[43] In my view, the RAD's two-step analysis was transparent and intelligible. The Applicant positioned her sur place claim as a continuation of her Christian practices in China. Once that aspect of her claim was found to be fraudulent, the primary basis of her sur place claim fell away. Nevertheless, the RAD considered whether she had genuinely adopted and practiced her Christian faith while in Canada but concluded she had not.\n[17] The RAD undertook the same two-step analysis of Mr. XXXX's sur place claim. As a result, I find no reviewable error in the RAD's reliance on the negative credibility findings that undermine Mr. XXXX's description of the source of his Christian beliefs as one element in its assessment of the sur place claim.14 [emphasis added]\nCONCLUSION\n[33] I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution in China in relation to his practice of Falun Gong. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant does not face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returns to China.\n[34] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nKaren McGovern\nKaren McGovern\nJanuary 6, 2023\nDate\n1 M.C.I. v.

The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection .\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The Appellant's allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim form (BOC)2 and his narrative.3 In short, the Appellant alleges that he fears harm from the Iranian regime for three reasons, a land dispute with a shia mullah, his Kurdish ethnicity and Sunni religion.\n[5] The Appellant notes that in XXXX of 2018, he and his uncle attempted to sell some family land only to discover that a Shia Mullah had ownership of the land. The Appellant unsuccessfully approached the police, who would not lodge a complaint. The Appellant later got into a fight with the Mullah's sons. He was then arrested and detained for two months. The Appellant then spent another month in police custody and was released on bail. The Appellant alleges he was offered to sign a form saying he would join the war in Syria for six months in exchange for his criminal charge being removed.\n[6] The Appellant left Iran and came to Canada, making a claim for refugee protection.\nStandard of review\n[7] I have applied the standard of correctness and arrived at independent findings based on the evidence before me.4\n[8] The RPD had numerous credibility concerns with the Appellant's claim. The Appellant argues that the RPD:5\na. Erred in its credibility assessment by basing findings on irrelevant inconsistencies and peripheral factors; and\nb. Erred in its assessment of the Appellant's residual profile.\n[9] I agree with the RPD's credibility concerns and confirm the RPD's negative determination. I find that the determinative issue in this appeal is credibility.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[10] The Appellant has provided three new pieces of evidence for the purpose of his appeal:\n1) A summons dated XXXX XXXX, 2021;6\n2) A letter from the Appellant's mother dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;7 and\n3) A summons dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.8\n[11] Subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) provides that the Appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of her claim or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[12] The second step in the analysis for new evidence is to consider it in relation to the adapted Raza factors endorsed in Singh.9 In Singh, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) held that the RAD should assess the admissibility of the new evidence for its credibility, relevance and newness. The RAD will therefore apply the Raza factors, minus the \"materiality\" factor, as this is to be assessed in light of subsection 110(6) of the IRPA only.\n[13] The first document is a summons issued on XXXX XXXX, 2021. The second item is a letter from the Appellant's mother dated XXXX XXXX, 2022. The third document is dated XXXX XXXX, 2022. I note that all three documents are dated post-rejection of the RPD claim and could not have reasonably been available at the time of the negative refugee determination.\n[14] In relation to items 1 and 3, after a review of this document and in performing a comparison with the samples provided in the National Documentation Package (NDP),10 I find that these documents are not reliable. The documents are inconsistent with the summons samples provided in the NDP. While the documentary evidence indicates that there is no standard for all the issues summons, this note appears with the caveat that some summons are issued electronically.11 The documentation goes on to note it would be \"relatiavely easey to forget a court document.\"12\n[15] Observing the first summons submitted by the Appellant and comparing it to the sample in the NDP documentation, I note that the structure and format of the summons is not consistent with the NDP documentation. While the Appellant's summons does have has boxes that accompany lines of text, the sample and the objective documentary evidence note that the reason for appearance would be included in this document. The Appellant's summons document does not include a reason for appearance and does not include the name of the \"Agent Serving the Notice\" or a spot for the \"Signature of the person being summoned\" as noted in the sample.\n[16] In observing the third document, an additional summons which includes notice of an arrest warrant, I note that it too varies from the samples provided. When I compare this document to the sample criminal summons found in the NDP, I also find that this document is not reliable. While I note that this document does provide a reason that the Appelalnt is required to appear, it again is missing the location of the justice department and the prosecution office at the top of the page. The Appellant's document is also missing the signature of the serving agent and date, which is inconsistent in structure with the originals provided in the NDP documentation.\n[17] While these documents both contain stamps and signatures, there is no security features that would help determine their legitimacy. I find on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant has submitted two fraudulent summons and therefore cannot accept them as new evidence. I note that I am not obligated to put an obvious inconsistency between the Appellant's documents and the material provided in the NDP for Iran to the Appellant for an explanation.13 The case law indicates that where there is sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the authenticity of a document, whether because of an irregularity on the face or the questionable circumstances in which it was obtained or provided, the document may be assigned little or no weight.14 Further, evidence of the widespread availability of fraudulent documents in a country is not by itself sufficient to reject foreign documents as forgeries, but it may be relevant if there are other reasons to question the documents or a claimant's credibility.15\n[18] In relation to item two, the Appellant has provided a letter from his mother detailing allegations that the police are still looking for him. I note this document was created post-rejection of the Appellant's claim and could not have reasonably been provided at the time of the RPD determination. However, the contents of this document relate to the service of a summons that I have found to be fraudulent. As this letter refers to an unreliable document, I cannot find the contents to be credible or relevant, and it therefore lacks any probative value. I therefore reject this document as new evidence.\n[19] Since new evidence that has been admitted does not create any concerns relating to credibility, I do not have the authority to conduct an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[20] The RPD made numerous negative credibility findings, including inconsistencies, delay in departure from Iran and confusing testimony about his arrival in Canada.\n[21] I have conducted an independent review of the transcripts of the RPD hearing,16 as well as the Record. I agree with each of the RPD's credibility findings, for the same reasons provided by the RPD.\n[22] These numerous credibility findings relate to material elements of the Appellant's claim and are consistent with the evidence. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of the inconsistency regarding the Appellant's detention. Having reviewed the Record and the transcripts, I disagree. The RPD's reasons are detailed and complete, they accurately reflect the information in the Appellant's Schedule 12,17 which he attested was truthful, complete and correct,18 as well as his testimony on the Record. The Appellant failed to provide a reasonable explanation as to why the dates he provided for his detention varied by months, noting only it was a difficult time. The reasons are clear and I find that they are correct.\nDelay in Departure\n[23] The Appellant was released from detention in XXXX of 2019 however, despite holding a valid visitor visa to Canada,19 he did not leave Iran until XXXX of 2019. When asked by the panel why he did not leave Iran at the earliest opportunity, the Appellant noted he needed to care for his mother. I agree with the RPD that this explanation is not reasonable. The Appellant testified that he was he was on bail for the criminal charge of assault and feared he would be detained for a lengthy prison term. He has siblings living in the same area of Iran as their mother, and no reasonable explanation was provided as to why they could not assist with the care of their mother.\n[24] If the Appellant genuinely feared a long detention or worse, I find it reasonable that he would have left Iran at the earliest opportunity. I draw a negative credibility inference in relation to the central allegations of his claim, that he feared detention or harm at the hands of the Iranian police.\nThe inconsistencies relating to the incidents at the Port of Entry (POE)\n[25] The Appellant travelled to Canada with an unrelated male child. When he was questioned at the Port of Entry and told he was inadmissible because he used a fraudulent document for the purpose of obtaining a visa, the Appellant made a claim for protection. The child's father was contacted and stated he was at the aiport to pick up his cousin and child. He stated his cousin, the Appellant would be working for him as a welder.\n[26] The Appellant did not initially include the information of what happened at the Port of Entry in his Basis of Claim. However, the Minister intervened20 in this matter due to credibility concerns and the panel became aware of what took place at the POE. After the intervention, the Appellant noted that he left Iran with his counsin's child to ease his exit form Iran.21\n[27] At the hearing, the Appellant testified that the child's father was in fact not his cousin and instead belonged to a brother of a friend. When asked why he referred to the child's father as his cousin in his response to the Minister's intervention, the Appellant said he wasn't sure what he had said and that he used the term cousin because he is close to the family. He noted problems with the interpreter, but denies telling the Canadian Border Service Agency that he had difficulty. The Appellant made a further denial that he was planning to take a job at a welding shop run upon his arrival in Canada, a job offer that was disclosed by the child's father to the Border Services Officer (BSO).\n[28] While the Appellant argues that the RPD put too much emphasis on the Port of Entry notes, in this particular circumstance, I disagree. This is not the only inconsistency in the Appellant's story, and the Appellant failed to provide this information until the Minister intervened with the evidence surrounding the events at the POE. While the Appellant notes that the RPD is preferring POE notes over the sworn testimony of the Appellant, I note that it was the Appellant himself who provided the evidence that the father of this child was in fact his cousin.\n[29] While this omission and evolving evidence would usually be peripheral to this matter, I find that in these circumstances they are not. The Appellant has provided inconsistent testimony and delayed leaving his native country of Iran. I have found that he has also provided fraudulent documents for the purpose of his appeal. This is just another example of the Appellant providing inconsistent evidence to immigration officials, including the RPD. I agree with the RPD and do not fault the Appellant for supplying a fraudulent document for the purpose of his Temporary Resident Visa application, it's the failure of the Appellant to admit to any untruths he told at the time he tried to enter Canada. I draw a negative credibility inference with regards to the Appellant's inconsistent evidence relating to what occurred at the Port of Entry.\nSupporting Documents\n[30] The Appellant has provided four letters from his family members, specifically his uncle, brother, sister and mother. These letters are unsworn. They provide information about the land dispute but have limited probative value in relation to the Appellant's alleged arrest. I have found the Appellant's allegations regarding his arrest and detention to not be credible. I have also rejected documentary evidence regarding those alleged events to be fraudulent and therefore find that the unsworn letters of family members do not overcome my earlier credilbity findings in this matter.\nResidual profile\n[31] After a review of the Appellant's testimony and his documentary evidence, I do find that he has established on a balance of probabilities that he is of Kurdish ethnicity and a Sunni Muslim. While the documentary evidence suggests that Sunnis are discriminated against in Iran, but it is hard to distinguish whether the root of the discrimination is religious or ethnic, because most Sunnis are also members of ethnic minorities.22 There is evidence of people imprisoned due to their teachings of Sunni Islam, as well as those involved in political related crimes,23 and Department Of Foreign Affairs And Trade assesses Sunnis as facing a moderate risk of discrimination in Iran.24\n[32] There are approximately 5-11 million Kurds in Iran. The language is not banned, but schools do not teach it and political groups and media are scrutinized and harassed for supporting Kudish independence.25 Some note that under the Rouhani government things had improved, and that activists have been allowed to hold peaceful rallies and some cultural activities have been able to resume.\n[33] The Appellant testified that he was not engaged in Kurdish events or groups in Iran. Furthermore, he has not attended any such activities in Canada. He also noted that he does not have strong feelings about Sunni versus Shia issues and does not attend any Sunni meetings or services. I find the Appellant's testimony to be consistent with the documentary evidence and I accept that he may face discrimination based on his Kurdish and Sunni ethnicity and religion. However, I find in the Appellant's particular circumstances, the allegations made by the Appellant relating to his profile as a Kurdish Sunni do not rise to the level of persecution. The Appellant has failed to establish that he is engaged in activities that would attract negative attention from the Iranian regime.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nKimberley Foreman\nK.

XXXX XXXX XXXX(Appellant) is a citizen of Nigeria. The Appellant alleges that he is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The Appellant alleges there is a warrant for his arrest due to his activities on behalf of both organizations. The Appellant also fears All Progressives Congress (APC) thugs. The Appellant also fears family members for refusing to submit his daughter to Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the Appellant not to be credible relying on unexplained inconsistencies and omissions in the Appellant's evidence. The RPD found the Appellant did not establish that he was wanted by Nigerian authorities. The RPD found the Appellant did not establish his political profile(s).1 The RPD accepted that the Appellant refused to have his daughter subjected to FGM but found that he did not establish a risk of harm pursuant to section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[3] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment in that the inconsistencies and omissions were reasonably explained. The Appellant argues the RPD was overly vigilant in its microscopic examination of the evidence. The Appellant argues the RPD did not consider all the evidence. The Appellant argues the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant showed a lack of knowledge regarding his Biafra-related activities. The Appellant argues the RPD erred in its assessment of his documentary evidence in support of his political profile(s). The Appellant argues the RPD erred in finding that his activities in Canada did not establish a forward-facing risk. The Appellant argues the RPD erred in drawing negative inferences from a lack of corroborative evidence.\n[4] On February 20, 2020, the Minister intervened at the RPD on the issue of the Appellant's credibility. 2 The Minister has not submitted any new evidence or submissions on appeal.\n[5] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is credibility.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[7] The Appellant has not provided new evidence.3\nANALYSIS\n[8] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.4 In my own independent analysis, having reviewed the entire record including the hearing transcripts, I find that the Appellant is not credible and that he has not established his political profile(s). I find that the RPD was correct in its analysis of the Appellant's fear related to his refusal to subject his daughter to FGM.\nThe Appellant has not established his political profile related to IPOB\nInconsistencies at the POE related to IPOB are not explained\n[9] The RPD drew a negative inference from the Appellant failing to include his membership\/association with either MASSOB or IPOB in his intake forms.5 The Appellant argues that this is an error as the Appellant explained that he was not allowed to read back his statements and that the form in his own handwriting provided by the Minister does mention his IPOB activities and he was confused when he was first questioned.\n[10] Though it is unclear which handwritten form the Appellant is referring to, I find that the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference from the Appellant's failure to mention his association with a Biafra organization in his intake forms because, the same day he signed his intake forms, he indicated during his interview with Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) that he was involved with Biafra separatism.6 However, there are other unexplained inconsistencies derived from the intake interview.\n[11] When the Appellant was first interviewed, when he made his refugee claim, he said he was a supporter of Biafra (I accept that the Appellant made a minor spelling mistake when writing 'BAFRA')7 but he did not mention that he was associated with IPOB as he had testified.8 When asked by the RPD for an explanation, the Appellant said that he was afraid, tense and not really himself.9 I do not accept this explanation as reasonable. If the Appellant was making a refugee claim based on his membership in IPOB, it is reasonable to expect that he would be able to recall the name of this organization when he first arrived.\n[12] I also note that the Appellant provided inconsistent information about the Biafra organization that he was associated with which further undermined his explanation that he was not really himself. The Appellant was asked by the officer if Biafra was similar to MASSOB and IPOB to which the Appellant stated that Biafra is the group and MASSOB and IPOB fall under it.10 This is inconsistent as Biafra is not a group but a region in Nigeria.11\n[13] Further, the Appellant said that the Biafra leader ran away to Israel and that this leader was the leader of both MASSOB and IPOB.12 As noted by the CBSA officer, this is inconsistent with the documentary evidence. In response to this inconsistency the Appellant stated that XXXX XXXX is the leader of BIAFRA and both MASSOB and IPOB see him as their leader. I do not accept this explanation as reasonable because this explanation is not consistent with the objective evidence. XXXX XXXX left MASSOB and became the leader of a different group, IPOB.13\n[14] As such, I am drawing a negative inference regarding the Appellant's association with IPOB.\nBOC omission of 2015 arrest related to IPOB activities not explained\n[15] The Appellant testified that he was arrested in 2015 due to his IPOB activities. However, this arrest is not mentioned in his Basis of Claim (BOC). In response to this omission, the Appellant explained he did not know that he had to write everything in his BOC.14 I do not accept this explanation as reasonable. The Appellant is represented by experienced counsel. It is reasonable to expect that if the Appellant was arrested in 2015 due to his IBOP activities, and he was represented by counsel, it would be mentioned in his BOC. As such, I am drawing a negative inference regarding the Appellant's credibility.\nLack of knowledge regarding IPOB activities not explained\n[16] The RPD found the Appellant did not explain his lack of knowledge related to his MASSOB and IPOB activities. The RPD noted that the Appellant should have known how many rallies he organized and that his testimony should have been detailed and spontaneous regarding his duties and role. 15 The Appellant argues this is an error because the Appellant provided detailed evidence regarding his activities and connections to both organizations. The Appellant argues the RPD ignored evidence in that he testified that they hold meetings in Aba and that he goes to China and has t-shirts printed for IBOP in China. He also testified about reaching out by word of mouth to people informing them of the IBOP activities.\n[17] Regarding lack of knowledge and vague testimony regarding MASSOB and IPOB, I agree with the Appellant that he did provide some details regarding his activities with these organizations. After my review, I can see that the Appellant provided general answers to general questions about his activities. The RPD erred in drawing a negative inference without considering that the Appellant did provide other details regarding his activities as noted above. Further, it is not reasonable to expect a person to count the number of protests if there were too many to count.\nUnexplained inconsistency regarding IBOP \"commands\"\n[18] The RPD asked the Appellant to explain the organization and structure of IPOB. The Appellant testified that all of the states have their different commands, he noted Abia Command, Ebony Command, Imo Command and that all the states in the east have their different commands.16 As noted by the RPD this is inconsistent with the objective evidence which describes the organization as being broken up into chapters.17 In response, the Appellant states that he knew them as commands. The Appellant argues there is nothing in the objective evidence to support that the IPOB refers to chapters. I disagree, as there are multiple sources describing chapters in the IPOB organization including one source noted as the IPOB organization itself.18\n[19] Regarding the Appellant's argument that this finding was microscopic, I disagree. It is reasonable to expect that a person connected to IPOB, with the Appellant's alleged experience in having always participated and that he planned protests for IPOB in different areas,19 would know the basics of the organization structure. As such, I do not find that the RPD was being microscopic.\n[20] I also note that the Appellant has not provided any new evidence from or about the organization which speaks to this concern raised by the RPD. As such, I am drawing a negative inference regarding the Appellant's credibility regarding his connection to IPOB.\n[21] The RPD also drew a negative inference from the Appellant omitting from his BOC that it was a police connection that informed him of his risk and that the Appellant failed to provide corroborative evidence. The Appellant argues there was no material omission as the Appellant said he got the information from a reliable source. I agree that the RPD erred as the police source is not a material omission in this instance.\n[22] However, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant did not provide a reasonable explanation regarding his failure to try and get proof from his friend in the police that a warrant was issued. The Appellant has not argued against this finding. The Appellant testified, when asked by the Minister's representative, that he did not ask his police friend to get a copy of the warrant, he speculated that maybe the warrant was not issued.20 The Appellant testified that it never occurred to him to ask for a copy as everyone was on the run after the election.21 Given the importance of such a document in supporting his claim, it is reasonable to expect that the Appellant would have made some effort to get documentation in support of the warrant. As noted, the Appellant was represented by counsel.\n[23] Given the above credibility concerns, I find that the Appellant has not established that he was part of a Biafra separatist organization such as IPOB.\nThe RPD erred in some of its analysis\n[24] The Appellant argued against other credibility findings that were made by the RPD regarding the Appellant's membership in MASSOB\/IPOB. For example, the RPD found that the Appellant's evidence that he joined IPOB in 2013 was inconsistent with the majority of the objective evidence which states that IPOB was founded in 2014. On this point, I agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred as there were other references in the National Documentation Package (NDP) that the IPOB was formed between 2012 and 2014. 22 Therefore, the Appellant's explanation that he joined in 2013 as a volunteer without any formal process is reasonable and the RPD's negative inference on this point cannot stand.\n[25] The RPD found that the Appellant did not provide a reasonable explanation for not stating in his Schedule 12 form that he was being sought by police.23 The Appellant argues this was an error because he did mention this to the CBSA officer.24 I agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference as the Appellant explained to the CBSA officer that he was wanted by Nigerian authorities.25 Therefore, a reasonable explanation was provided by the Appellant.\n[26] Although I have found the RPD erred in these instances, this does not interfere with my credibility finding related to the Appellant's IPOB profile.\nDocuments provided in support of IBOP\/MASSOB are not sufficient to overcome credibility concerns\n[27] The Appellant provided a letter from Aba Command.26 The RPD found the letter did not remedy credibility findings.27 The Appellant argues that this was in error as the RPD pointed to shifting evidence but did not indicate how the Appellant's evidence shifted. The Appellant also argues that the Appellant did provide consistent details on how he got the letter.\n[28] Regarding, the shifting evidence, I agree that the RPD erred in not explaining how the Appellant's evidence shifted. However, I can correct this error with my own assessment.\n[29] I find that the letter, more likely than not, is fraudulent. As noted above, I find that the letter using the word \"Command\" in the header is inconsistent with documentary evidence. As such, I find that this diminishes the reliability of the document. The letter also states that the Appellant left Nigeria as there were threats to his life and that of his family. However, this is inconsistent with the Appellant's evidence in that the Appellant did not leave Nigeria due to threats to his family.\n[30] The letter is dated XXXX XXXX, 2020, and the only family member mentioned by the Appellant at risk from the Nigerian Army is his father who he alleged was killed by the Nigerian Army in XXXX, 201828 or in XXXX 201929 or XXXX XXXX, 2018.30 All of these dates for the death of his father's death are prior to date of the letter. Therefore, the letter cannot be referring to life threats against his father. The Appellant alleged his father was a leader of IPOB and that he died after he was shot at an IPOB meeting.31 Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the IPOB author of the letter would know of the Appellant's father's death. As such, I am giving the letter no weight and find, more likely than not, that it is fraudulent.\n[31] The Appellant argues the RPD erred in stating that the IBOP letter did not support that the Appellant faced persecution because the letter does state that there were threats to the Appellant's life. The Appellant argues that it was an error to draw a negative credibility inference from this third party letter and that it was an error to weigh what the letter did not say. On this point, given that I have found the letter to be fraudulent, these arguments are moot. Given, that the Appellant has provided a fraudulent document in support of claim, I am drawing a negative inference regarding his credibility.\nCanadian Igbo association letters are not sufficient to establish the Appellant's IPOB or MASSOB activities in Nigeria nor are they sufficient to establish a genuine Sur Place claim\n[32] The Appellant provided a letter from the Igbo Canadian Community Association Umunna (ICCA\/UMUNNA).32 The letter is dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, and states that the organization propagates the culture of the Igbo people and that the Appellant has identified with the Igbo community. The letter also states that the Appellant was active in supporting an Igbo nation in Nigeria and that he is a member of the PDP. The letter also states that the Appellant is being targeted by Nigerian security agencies.\n[33] The RPD found that the letter did not establish IPOB or separatist activities and found the letter to be of low probative value. The RPD pointed to the letter not indicating how the information about the Appellant was gathered and that the Appellant also could not say how the information was acquired. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in not giving weight to the letter given that the credibility findings made by the RPD were made in error and his credible testimony together with these letters clearly establish his profile. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding that the letters were of low probative value given that a document cannot be faulted for what it does not say. The Appellant argues that the Appellant testified that the Canadian group verified his activities by calling Nigeria.\n[34] I note that there is no reference in the objective evidence regarding the Igbo Canadian Community Association or that persons associated with this organization are at risk in Nigeria nor has the Appellant pointed to any evidence that his association with this organization in Canada impacts a forward facing risk in Nigeria. As noted by the RPD, the letter does not mention how the author knows of the Appellant's profile or his experiences in Nigeria. Though the Appellant testified that he did not tell the author what to write, the Appellant was unable to say with any clarity how the information about him being wanted by Nigerian authorities was obtained. The RPD found him to be evasive.33 I also note that the Appellant did not provide any further evidence to the RPD to explain how the information was verified nor did the Appellant submit new evidence to explain how the information was gathered. As such, I find the RPD was correct in giving the document low weight.\n[35] The Appellant also provided a letter from the IPOB.34 The letter is dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020. The letter is addressed to the IRB in Toronto. The letter states that upon his arrival to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, he joined their forum. The RPD doubted the legitimacy and reliability of the letter noting that there was no address or contact information on the letterhead. The Appellant argues that the fact that there is no address is of no concern as there is a Canadian phone number.\n[36] I disagree with the Appellant's argument. According to the documentary evidence, there are IBOP representatives abroad, led by the Directorate of State and that there are 88 representatives around the world.35 In this case, it is reasonable to expect that the letter would not only include an address which could be used to verify the document's information but also it would include the author's position and authority within the organization. In my view, simply providing a Canadian telephone number is not consistent with the prominence and scope of the IPOB organization. Further, the Appellant has not provided any new evidence from the organization to answer the RPD's concerns. There is also no objective evidence of the nature of a Canadian IPOB branch. As such, I find more likely than not that the letter is fraudulent and I am giving it no weight.\n[37] Further, even if the document was authentic, it still does not support that the Appellant was an active member of IPOB in Nigeria. As noted above the letter states that the Appellant joined the forum after arriving in Canada. Also, the letter does not provide any details on the Appellant's specific activities.\n[38] I have also considered if the Appellant's association with the Canadian Igbo organizations would establish a sur place claim. On this point I note that there is no documentary evidence presented that membership in the ICCA in Canada would cause a risk for the Appellant. The Appellant has not provided any evidence that his activities in Canada have become known in Nigeria or that there is any known risk. I find that the RPD was correct to find that the Appellant's photo of him in Canada in front of a Biafra Memorial Celebration banner and flyers of IPOB events does not establish that his activities in Canada would put him at risk in Nigeria.36\n[39] The Appellant argues that his activities in Canada are further proof that he will continue to be involved in the struggle should he return to Nigeria. However, I find, that given the serious credibility concerns noted above, that the Appellant joining a Biafra separatist organization in Canada, was done, more likely than not, to bolster his refugee claim rather than a genuine expression of political activism.\nThe Appellant has not established that he is a member of the PDP\nInconsistency at the POE regarding the Appellant's political profile was not explained\n[40] The RPD drew a negative inference from an inconsistency in the Appellant's evidence. The Appellant stated at the POE that he was a member of the APC, when he was first interviewed. This is inconsistent with the Appellant's BOC which states that he is a member of the PDP, having left the APC after becoming disenchanted.37 In response to this inconsistency, the Appellant offered two explanations, one was that he did tell the immigration officer that he was a member of the PDP.38 The other explanation was that he was not himself and traumatized and he was having chest pain.39\n[41] The Appellant argues the RPD erred in not considering the totality of the evidence. The Appellant argues that it is reasonable he misstated his political party while being interrogated due to milieu of the situation. I disagree with this argument.\n[42] After my review, I find that the RPD was correct to draw a negative inference regarding this inconsistency. Even if the Appellant was shaken emotionally by the POE interview, it does not make sense that he would say that he was a member of the APC, when this was not true and when he is alleging to fear the APC. When asked why he was making a refugee claim the Appellant stated that this was due to political activities.40\n[43] Further, the Appellant went on to describe the APC as the African Congregation Party41 which is inconsistent with the Appellant's BOC and the documentary evidence which notes the correct name of the APC is the All Progressives Congress. In response the Appellant explained that he was afraid of being sent back and that he shouted and was disoriented.42 If the Appellant fled Nigeria due to his political activities, it is reasonable to expect that he would be able to recall which party he was a member of and, if ever was a member of the APC, that he would be able to recall the name of the party with consistency. The Appellant corrected that he was a member of the PDP in his second interview43, three days after his original interview, but he still got the APC party name wrong. The Appellant referred to the APC as the All People's Congress.44\n[44] Regarding the Appellant's explanation that he did tell the Immigration Officer that he was a member of the PDP, I find that the Immigration Officer would have no reason to leave this information out of his record. Further, the continued interview shows that the officer focused on the APC and did not ask any questions about the PDP.45 Though the Appellant did mention that he supported XXXX XXXX,46 who was the leader of the PDP in the 2019 election,47 this does not explain why the Appellant would state that he was a member of the APC.\n[45] As such, I am drawing a negative inference regarding the Appellant's credibility in regards to his political profile.\nBOC omission of arrest in XXXX 2018 not explained\n[46] In his second interview, the Appellant stated that he was arrested in 2018 while campaigning for XXXX.48 The Appellant stated that he was arrested for plotting (against) the ruling government. When asked why he omitted including this information in his BOC, part of the Appellant's answer is inaudible in the transcript but I listened to the audio and the Appellant said I did not know that I was going to include everything49 it would be a very (inaudible) book. I do not accept this explanation as reasonable. The Appellant was represented by counsel at the RPD. If he was arrested due to his political activities, and he is afraid of returning due to his political activities it is reasonable to expect that this would be included in his BOC. As such, I am drawing a negative inference regarding the Appellant's credibility.\nPDP letter does not overcome credibility concerns\n[47] The Appellant provided a letter from the PDP.50 The RPD gave the letter no weight in establishing the Appellant's political profile because the letter was vague in describing the Appellant's circumstances, and there were spelling mistakes including the name of the PDP party. The Appellant argues the RPD cannot draw a negative inference from a third party document nor can the RPD draw a negative inference from what the letter failed to state. The Appellant argues the spelling mistakes were insignificant and the RPD was being microscopic.\n[48] I agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference from a microscopic analysis of the PDP letter. For example, the spelling mistakes as noted by the RPD were minor. I also agree that the RPD appears to be drawing a negative inference from information not contained in the letter. However, on my review, I am not giving any weight to the PDP letter.\n[49] I note that the letter is undated and that it does not include any contact information. The PDP is a major political party in Nigeria.51 If this were an authentic letter from the PDP it is reasonable to expect that the letter would include the date that the letter was written and contact information. I also note that the stamp asks for the date of signature but this is also blank. 52Given that the letter is asking for assistance for the Appellant, it is reasonable to expect that contact information would be included for verification. It is reasonable to expect that a State Chapter Chairman would not sign such an unprofessional document. As such, I find more likely than not, that the document is fraudulent and I am drawing a negative inference from the Appellant providing a fraudulent document in support of his claim.\nThe Appellant's use of fraudulent documents to travel to Canada undermines his credibility\n[50] The Appellant has not provided a reasonable explanation for why he used fraudulent means to acquire his Canadian visa at a time before he felt the need to flee Nigeria for his safety. The Appellant paid a third party to get him a Canadian visa in XXXX 2018.53 The application was fabricated including describing the Appellant as a researcher\/educator. Fraudulent documents in support of the application and a fraudulent reason for wanting to visit Canada were submitted to Canadian authorities.54 The Appellant testified that he started fearing for his life XXXX XXXX, 201955 which is months after he submitted his fraudulent visa application.\n[51] In response to this concern the Appellant explained that he met a person who said she could get him a visa to Canada, he paid about XXXX Canadian and that he was unaware that this person had obtained the visa through fraudulent means.56 I do not accept this explanation as reasonable. It is reasonable to expect that a person applying to travel would be aware of the contents of an application that is being presented in their name with their identification. As noted by the Minister, the Appellant is a person with extensive travel and visa application experience.\n[52] For example, the Appellant first said, in response to the POE officer, \"How can this be, my good friend help me get the visa.\"57 When asked about using his friend, the Appellant responded that he had actually used an agent to acquire the visa. In this case, I find that the Appellant was attempting to minimize his relationship to the person to which he first described as a good friend. I also note the Appellant testified that he was fingerprinted by Canadian authorities at the time he provided his application.58 It is reasonable to expect that if a person had an appointment related to his application that he would be aware of the application that he provided. It does not make sense that he would appear for this appointment blind to what was said or what was in his application.\n[53] I also note that the Appellant stated to the immigration officer, when asked why he did not apply to come to Canada as a permanent resident, the Appellant answered that Canadians are not giving out work permits and \"he told me to come on this visitor visa.\"59 In my view this statement supports that the Appellant was not planning a vacation but that he was trying to come to Canada via any means.\n[54] As such, I find that the Appellant's credibility regarding the reasons for travelling to Canada is further undermined.\n[55] Given all of the above noted credibility concerns, I find that the Appellant has not established that he was associated with IPOB or the PDP. I also find that the Appellant is not wanted in Nigeria for his activities on behalf of these organizations.\nDocuments offered in support of the claim do not overcome credibility concerns\n[56] The Appellant provided an affidavit from his friend who also alleges to be a member of the PDP.60 The affiant states that he was involved and a witness to the event where the Appellant was involved in election violence. The RPD gave the document little weight as the affiant is not mentioned in the Appellant's BOC, there are spelling mistakes, the affiant knew the exact date that the Appellant joined the PDP whereas the PDP chairman did not.\n[57] The Appellant puts forward the same arguments as they did against the RPD's PDP letter findings. The Appellant also argues the RPD erred in expecting the name of the affiant to be included in his BOC. On these points, I agree that the RPD erred in conducting a microscopic analysis in regard to spelling mistakes and for not including the affiant's name in the BOC. I do not agree with the Appellants arguments regarding negative inferences from a third party and information not included, as the RPD did not rely on either for this document.\n[58] However, I am also giving the affidavit little weight, but for different reasons. The affiant states that the Appellant joined the PDP on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and this is inconsistent with the Appellant's evidence that he joined the PDP in XXXX 2017.61 Further, the affidavit cannot, on its own, overcome the credibility concerns noted.\n[59] The Appellant provided photographs of damaged ballots,62 and a photo and video depicting the thug that was beaten and injured,63 during election violence. The RPD gave this evidence no weight in establishing the Appellant's allegations. The Appellant argues that this evidence confirms that there was election violence and that the Appellant gave detailed evidence regarding the person who took the photographs and video. On this point I agree with the RPD that this evidence is of low probative value given there is no objective connection to Appellant. The Appellant's image is not captured in any of this evidence. The RPD did not dispute that there was election violence, the RPD was unable to give the evidence weight as the evidence was not corroborated to source and circumstance, other than the Appellant's own testimony that the evidence was gathered when the Appellant was involved in election day violence.\n[60] The Appellant also provided an affidavit from his neighbour.64 On my review, I find that the affidavit is of low weight in that the affidavit on its own, cannot overcome the credibility concerns as noted above.\nThe above credibility assessment is determinative of the claim related to the Appellant's fear of Nigerian authorities and APC thugs\n[61] The RPD made other credibility findings regarding the Appellant's allegations that he is wanted by Nigerian authorities and APC thugs and the Appellant has argued against these findings. I have reviewed all of the Appellants arguments and even if these were accepted, these would not overcome my findings that the Appellant is not associated with the PDP or IPOB or that he is wanted by Nigerian authorities.\nThe Appellant has not established a risk of harm due to his refusal of having his daughter subjected to FGM\n[62] The RPD accepted that the Appellant did lose his elder daughter to FGM. However, the RPD considered the Appellant's testimony that he would not be harmed if he stayed away from his family's compound. The RPD also found that Appellant's risk of harm based on voodoo was also not established. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in not taking into account foreign cultures.\n[63] I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant has not established a risk of harm due this refusal of FGM. The Appellant testified that his daughter would be subjected to FGM if she set foot in the family compound.65 The Appellant lives in Lagos and his father's compound is in XXXX, Enugu State.66 The Appellant testified that he would be excommunicated and not allowed to participate in family events.67 The Appellant testified that his family would only be able to force the FGM if he brought her to the compound.68 The Appellant testified that his family could spiritually harm him through his phone and that he could end up dying.69\n[64] Though the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in not considering his culture, the Appellant has not objectively established that he will be harmed through voodoo. The Appellant might believe that he would be harmed but harm through voodoo is not objectively corroborated. As such, I find that the RPD was correct to find that the Appellant did not establish a section 97 risk of harm. I also agree with the RPD that the risk, as alleged by the Appellant, does not amount to a serious possibility of persecution pursuant to section 96.70\nCONCLUSION\n[65] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nC.

She is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated March 14, 2022, rejecting her refugee protection claim.1\n[2] The Appellant alleges that she is unable to return to Vietnam because she fears harm at the hands of the Vietnamese police, who in XXXX 2019, began looking for her at her family home. According to the Appellant, she began practicing Hoa Hao Buddhism after her neighbor friend (XXXX XXXX) introduced her to it, following the death of her boyfriend in 2009. In XXXX 2017, she came to Canada on a Canadian student visa and claims to continue practicing Hoa Hao and going to the church temple of the Toronto Hoa Hao Association. In XXXX 2018, the Appellant allegedly sent Hoa Hap materials via Viber to XXXX XXXX, who in turn shared it with the group they used to practice together occasionally back in Vietnam. Subsequently, she claims that police arrested her neighbor friend and the other Buddhists in the group, after finding out that the Appellant, had sent the material from overseas. By end of XXXX 2020, her mother informed her that her uncle was unable to settle this matter through his network and connections and that her neighbor and the others have not been released.2\n[3] In its decision, the RPD identified credibility as the determinative issue.3 In this regard, the Panel found that the Appellant has not credibly established that on a balance of probabilities, she is a Hoa Hao Buddhist practitioner. The panel also concluded that she did not provide probative corroborative evidence to establish that this is the case.4 In addition, the RPD drew a negative inference from the Appellant's lack of effort to provide corroborative evidence with respect to her allegations that she is wanted by the police and found the explanation she provided for why she was unable to do so insufficient. Moreover, the RPD drew a negative inference from the fact that the Appellant did not provide letters of support from her mother and uncle to corroborate her allegations that the Vietnamese police were looking for her. In this regard, the RPD underscored that they were the only alleged witnesses to her allegations and that these documents were reasonably available to her with reasonable efforts.5\n[4] In her Memorandum of Appeal, the Appellant alleges that the RPD erred in its analysis and conclusion. This is because the RPD did not specify how much religious knowledge was expected from the Appellant and erred by expecting the Appellant to provide corroborating evidence.6 She also claims on appeal that the RPD applied the wrong legal test that is more than a mere possibility and not a serious possibility, and that she failed to understand what standard of proof it was applying for its section 97 test.7 The Appellant did not submit new evidence nor request an oral hearing.8\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[6] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.9\n[7] I find that the RPD is correct in its conclusion that the Appellant has not credibly established that she is a Hoa Hao Buddhism follower for the reasons that the RPD provided and which I have discussed below.\n[8] With respect to the RPD's conclusions that the Appellant has not credibly established that the Vietnamese police authorities are looking for her because of material she shared on Viber with her neighbor friend, I agree with the RPD's overall decision that the Appellant has not done so. However, I find that the RPD erred in not addressing in its decision, the fact that the Appellant submitted letters of support after the RPD hearing and before the RPD rendered its decision. Still, I do not find that this error is serious enough to undermine the correctness of the overall RPD decision that the Appellant has not established that she is wanted by Vietnamese police because of her religious practice and\/or identity or because of her political opinion (when sending a photo of the yellow Vietnamese flag with red stripes to her friend). This is because I conducted my own independent assessment of the evidence that was submitted and give it little probative value in establishing the Appellant's allegations that she is wanted by those authorities if she returns to Vietnam for those aforementioned reasons.\n[9] Even if I were to accept that the Appellant is indeed a Hoa Hao Buddhist, for reasons I explain in my decision, I agree with the RPD that she has not established that she faces a forward-looking risk of persecution in Vietnam, including at the hands of Vietnamese police authorities if she returns to Vietnam. I reach this conclusion in light of the country documentation that the Appellant submitted to the RPD, the objective country documentation in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Vietnam and after assessing the personal evidence she submitted after the RPD hearing to the RPD.\n[10] Finally, before laying out my reasons in detail I address the argument made by the Appellant on appeal that the RPD erred in applying the correct legal standard as far as its analysis of section 96 of IRPA is concerned, noting that \"[t]he test is \"more than a mere possibility' and not a \"serious possibility.\"10 In addition, the Appellant argued on appeal that \"the Board also failed to state what standard of proof it was applying for its s.97 test.\"11\n[11] I disagree with the Appellant. I find that the RPD was correct in its application of the legal standard of a \"serious possibility\" standard when it comes to its assessment under section 96 of IRPA. In this regard, the Federal Court has noted that using the \"more than a mere possibility\" standards \"would impose legal standard in the range of 80% on the Board to find the claimant was not a refugee; in effect requiring a finding of a near-certainty.\"12 I also disagree that the RPD failed to state what standard of proof it was applying for its section 97 test, as the panel explicitly stated at the very end of its decision that based on the totality of the evidence, it does not find that the Appellant has satisfied the burden of establishing that on a balance of probabilities, she would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to Vietnam.13 Below are my reasons\n(1) The RPD's Conclusion that the Appellant has not credibly established that she is a Hoa Hao Buddhist.\n[12] In its decision, the RPD concluded that the Appellant did not establish the credibility of her allegations that she is a Hoa Hao Buddhist practitioner. In reaching this conclusion, the RPD drew a negative inference from the following:\n(a) The Appellant's failure to recall important dates of celebration and commemoration in her religion and to provide corroborative evidence for the dates that she listed\n[13] In support of its conclusion, the RPD pointed out that when it inquired with the Appellant about the important dates recognized and\/or celebrated in her religion, she testified that they were: (1) January 1st-lunar new year; (2) January 15-Thuong Nguyen holiday; (3) April 15-Buddha's birthday and (4) August 12-commemoration of Tay An.\n[14] The RPD then pointed out that based on the NDP-related evidence, there were three days of festivals\/occasions that followers of the Hoa Hao religion worship per lunar year and which are: (a) February 25-day the grandmaster disappeared; (b) May 18-the date of the formation; (c) November 25- the birthday of the grandmaster.14 Subsequently, the RPD underscored that although the Appellant did mention November 25 as an important religious celebration day, she was unable to recount the two other days that are important for Hoa Hao followers to celebrate. This is despite alleging that she has been practicing the religion since 2016 (i.e., for the past 6 years). Hence, the RPD drew a negative inference from her inability to tell the panel of the three important dates that the religion recognizes.15\n[15] Secondly, the RPD asked the Appellant if she had any evidence to demonstrate that the other dates which she had mentioned in her oral testimony were recognized or acknowledged in her religion. In response, the Appellant testified that she had the information, and requested that she be permitted to provide it to the panel afterwards. When the RPD inquired with her why she did not provide this material at or prior to the RPD hearing, she first responded that she thought she had to provide the documents which is why she is offering to send them now. The RPD repeated the question, asking the Appellant to clarify why she failed to provide them prior to her RPD hearing. Here, she explained that she was only informed by Counsel's office of the date of the RPD hearing, five days before the hearing date, and that she did not have time to prepare all her documents. When then, the RPD pointed out to the Appellant that she had received a letter from the RPD back in XXXX 2021 informing her that her RPD hearing date was scheduled for March 9, 2022, she confirmed that she was aware of that, but that she was only informed 5 days prior to the hearing; that she had to work and did not have time to prepare.16\n[16] The RPD did not accept the Appellant's explanation for the following reasons: (1) her Notice to Appear was mailed to her in XXXX 2021, more than three months before the hearing and no mail was returned to the RPD; (2) the Appellant testified that she speaks English and at times throughout the hearing testified in English, so would have reasonably been aware of what the Notice to Appear said; (3) her explanation at the hearing for why she did not provide this material beforehand is internally inconsistent, since she first stated that she knew about the letter from XXXX 2021, but then stating that her lawyer did not tell her about the hearing until five days before the hearing and (4) she was given sufficient notice for the hearing and had ample time to provide corroborating evidence. (5) The Appellant provided a photo which she found online. Hence it was unclear to the RPD why she was able to locate a photo and provide it as evidence in time for the RPD hearing but could not provide evidence of these important dates despite her claim that she had these documents. Consequently, the RPD drew a negative inference from the Appellant failing to provide evidence which she testified is in her possession.\n[17] When the RPD inquired with the Appellant if there are any special days in her religion that she acknowledges or celebrates, she mentioned: (a) January 1-Lunar year, (2) January 15-Thuong Nguyen Holiday (3) November 25-comemoration of the death of the religion's leader; (4) December 8-commemoration of the death of Buddha (5) April 8-birth of Buddha and (6) August 12-the death of the leader Tayan.17 The RPD then noted that the panel does not have any documentary evidence in the file about the days she mentioned (with the exception of November 25) and inquired with the Appellant if she had anything to show that these are important days in her religion. In response, the Appellant states that she will be able to send that information to him later because she has it. As the RPD mentioned in its decision, the Appellant first acknowledged that she had received the notice to appear in XXXX 2021 informing her that the RPD hearing will be taking place today (March 9, 2022), but then added that the person who works for Counsel's office only informed her last Friday about the hearing, and since she had work, she had no time to prepare.18\n[18] While I agree with the RPD's decision not to accept the Appellant's explanation for why she did not have time to prepare for the RPD hearing, the issue here is not whether she discharged the onus of putting her best foot forward in terms of preparing for the hearing. Rather, the issue is whether the RPD was correct in drawing a negative inference from the Appellant's failure to provide documentary evidence to demonstrate that the other dates which she had mentioned in her oral testimony were recognized or acknowledged in her religion. I do not find that the Appellant can be faulted for not knowing prior to the RPD hearing took place, that her answers to the questions concerning her knowledge of her religion do not feature in the NDP on Vietnam. I therefore do not agree with the RPD's decision to draw a negative inference from her failure to submit documentary evidence that corroborates that the dates she mentioned were indeed important celebrations and\/or events in the Hoa Hao religion.\n[19] However, I do not find that this error by the RPD, is serious enough to undermine the overall correctness of the RPD conclusion that the Appellant has not discharged the onus of proving a central allegation to her claim, namely that these dates she testified about are important events or celebrations in her faith. The Appellant was represented by Counsel, who could still have sought to make a post RPD hearing submission of the documentary evidence she claimed to have in her possession, and which she offered to submit later to the RPD, or to submit them to the RAD. Thus, while she asked at the RPD hearing to submit it later, she never did. In another decision, the Federal Court underscored that \"the truthfulness of sworn statements in Maldonado applies only to the credibility of the truth of the claimant's sworn statement. It does not apply to the \"trustworthiness\" of the statement in reference to paragraph 170(h) of the IRPA, which defines the mandate of the RPD. Accordingly, a refugee claimant is required to make genuine efforts to substantiate the statement, including pursuant to Rule 11, as a condition to obtain \"the benefit of the doubt\" that the statement is trustworthy and in accordance with the UNCHR Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.\"19\nThe Appellant's testimony about why she joined the faith and what its four principles are\n[20] In its decision, the RPD drew a negative inference from what the RPD deemed to be a lack of details in the Appellant's oral testimony with respect to why she decided to join the Hoa Hao faith and begin practicing. In this regard, the RPD pointed out that when it asked the Appellant to explain what drew her to this religion, she testified that she joined because of the death of her boyfriend and because her friend advised her that it would help her find happiness and more energy. When the RPD then asked the Appellant if there was anything about the religion that made her want to join and begin practicing, she testified that her friend had given her materials and that after reading them she felt like fresh water was running through her body, that she found more energy and able to sleep again. However, the RPD opined that the Appellant's testimony lacked detail and that she was unable to provide testimony outside of what was already in her BoC narrative.\n[21] Hence, while the RPD acknowledged that the Appellant's testimony was generally consistent with her written narrative attached to her BoC, the Panel found that the Appellant was unable to offer any information beyond what she had written in her BoC and that this undermines her credibility.20 Subsequently, the RPD decided the Appellant's testimony lacking and repetitive and expected that a person who has been practicing the religion for nearly 6 years, would be able to testify to this in greater detail. Hence, the Panel concluded that the lack of details in the Appellant's testimony, with respect to her religion, undermined her credibility that she is indeed an adherent to this religion.21\n[22] On appeal, the Appellant alleges that the RPD expected an unrealistically high standard of religious knowledge from the Appellant as she claims on appeal. She also submits on appeal that the RPD did not specify the extent of knowledge that the panel expected from the Appellant based on the Panel's own knowledge acquired off the record or from the evidence on the record itself.22\n[23] During the RPD hearing, the panel inquired with the Appellant what drew her to join the Hoa Hao religion, and what interested her in this religion. In response, the Appellant stated that before her boyfriend passed away, she didn't know anything about this religion, but then her neighbor friend introduced her after he passed because she could not eat, sleep and did not know what to do.23 The RPD then asked the Appellant if there was anything about this religion in particular that made her decide to join. In response, the Appellant stated that her neighbor friend gave her a package of handwritten material to read and that it was like fresh water washing over her, making her feel more energy, that she was able to learn more lessons about Hoa Hao Buddha and that her friend continued to help her practice the religion.24 When then the panel asked her if she was still practicing in Canada, the Appellant responded that she does, and that on nights when she cannot go to the temple to practice she listens to talks about Buddha because they help her fall asleep.\n[24] The RPD then asked her to elaborate what other things she does to practice the religion. In response, the Appellant stated that on the special day she goes to the temple to pray and also prays at home. She also listens to YouTube. Later, when the RPD inquired with the Appellant, if other than all of this, there is anything else that she does as part of the religion, she responded that in Canada when she goes to the temple to practice, she has freedom and can do anything she likes whereas at home she is unable to. She then provides the example that she cannot follow the Vietnamese flag with the three red stripes over there.25 The RPD subsequently, asked the Appellant to tell the panel a bit about her religious beliefs and to give some information. In response, she stated that \"I believe in this religion very much because when I practice with this religion I become more energy, like it boosts me and it motivate me since my boyfriend pass away, so I find energy and just like the guy for me to live happily; since I am in Canada I able to live independent and do everything by myself.\"26\n[25] I agree with the RPD that the oral testimony of the Appellant was very vague and lacked concrete details about what the religious practices or beliefs of her religion are. It was also repetitive and replete with answers that reflected her general state of mind when she allegedly practices her faith, instead of any information on what the religion is concretely about or what it involves in terms of practices in the temple or at home. Hence, I find that the RPD was correct in concluding that a person who alleges to have been practicing this religion for nearly six years, praying every night,27 would be able to testify about the substantial part of the religion in greater detail.\n[26] In its decision, the RPD also noted that the Appellant was able to offer only very general testimony regarding religious principles such as not doing drugs and points out that, based on the objective country documentation,28 the Hoa Hao religion has four gratitude's and that this represents a substantial part of the religion that would be known to all followers. In this regard, the RPD pointed out that the panel had to ask the Appellant multiple times and then specifically inform the Appellant of the gratitude's before she was able to provide an explanation of what the gratitude's are. 29\n[27] During the RPD hearing, the panel asked if there are any specific principles in the Hoa Hao religion. In response the Appellant stated that\n* Appellant: \"[l]ike the principal cannot kill anymore, cannot lie, cannot do drugs, cocaine and also cannot drink alcohol....Have to treat and do good things to everyone and avoid to treat badly to anyone. You must love your country, you have to love everyone and you cannot betray, you have to be faithful.\n* RPD: So, from what I understand the religion has four gratitude's; do you know what those are?\n* Appellant: Four principal like in the Hoa Hao religion have to be like good with the parents, good with the people and have to be good with (inaudible), this mean like good with the Buddha, with the religion, also like have to be good to the country.30\n[28] I consulted the NDP on a Vietnam-related source which the RPD referred to in its decision (Item 1.5). It states that the religion has four gratitude's: (1) towards Buddhism and Buddhists; (2) ancestors (3) country and (4) humanity in general.31 I find that the Appellant provided an answer that contains the information that is available in the NDP. It is not clear to me whether or not the RPD drew a negative inference from the panel prompting the Appellant to provide an answer to what the four gratitude's are. In any case, I do not draw a negative inference from the Appellant's answer.\n[29] However, I still agree with the RPD that the Appellant did not establish with persuasive testimony that she is an adherent of the faith. This is because the Appellant alleged praying daily, frequent visits to the temple and listening to religious material at home. I do not find that the religious knowledge she displayed in her oral testimony is commensurate with the religious practice that she claims, or that it reflects an understanding of the most basic elements of the religion. This is because I find that the RPD was correct that the Appellant's answers were vague. Here, I also note that \"[t]he questions that were asked [by the RPD] were general and in no way touched on the details.\"32\nThe corroborative evidence that the Appellant provided to establish her profile as a follower of Hoa Hao Buddhism and vague testimony regarding that evidence\n[30] In its decision, the RPD assessed the letter of support which the Appellant provided from a person who allegedly knows her through the Toronto Hoa Hao Association.33 When the RPD inquired with the Appellant where she had met the author of the letter of support, she testified that she had met him at the temple. When the RPD then asked what the name of the temple was, she responded that it was on or near XXXX Avenue (Toronto). When probed again about the name of the temple by the RPD, the Appellant testified that it is like a Hoa Hao community. The RPD drew a negative inference from what it considered to be an evasive testimony. In this regard, the RPD underscored that both the letter and the Appellant stated that she attended this temple. Hence, the RPD expected the Appellant to be able to give the temple's name.34\n[31] I agree with the RPD's decision to draw a negative inference from the Appellant's failure to provide the name of the temple where she allegedly practices and has together with others, raised the yellow flag with the red stripes while praying in the past.35 The Appellant testified that she prayed at this temple. She provided a photo that was allegedly taken there, as supporting evidence, with individuals holding the yellow flag with the three red strips, allegedly disdained by the government authorities in Vietnam, and which is meant to demonstrate that the Hoa Hao followers have the freedom to practice and follow their religion freely in Canada. However, when the RPD inquired where this picture was taken, the Appellant could only respond with \"[t]he temple at XXXX...\" stating that there is not one temple only.36 The RPD panel asked her again twice afterwards, what the name of the temple is to which she first responded: \"On XXXX, nearby XXXX,\" and then \"It is like the Hoa Hao community,\" and that when she arrived her friend, from Vietnam, is the one who gave her a lift to go there.37\n[32] With respect to the letter, the RPD pointed out that the letter does not contain any security features, such as a letter head or an address of the temple. Hence, the RPD decided that this letter does not establish on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant is a member of the Toronto Hoa Hao Association or that she is a follower of the religion. Consequently, the RPD gave little weight to the letter in establishing the Appellant's religious identity.38 In addition, the Appellant testified that a friend, and former classmate in Vietnam, is the one who had taken her to the temple. When the RPD inquired with the Appellant as to his\/her name, she testified that his name was XXXX. The RPD found that this is another evidence that the Appellant's testimony with respect to the temple she attends to be evasive and vague and drew a negative inference.39\n[33] I agree with the RPD's decision to give little weight to the letter by an alleged member of the Toronto Hoa Hao Association in establishing the Appellant's allegation that she practices this religion. However, I do not agree with the RPD's decision to draw a negative inference from the lack of a letter head as the person writing it never testified that he is a member of the administration of the association. He merely stated that he is a member of the group. I hence do not expect that the letter should contain a letterhead.\n[34] However, I do agree with the RPD's decision to draw a negative inference from the lack of an address or any information about the Association. The letter simply states that the Appellant joined the Association around mid 2017 and that he is also a member of the group. The writer also provided a copy of his Ontario driving license. Nevertheless, the information in the letter is scarce and does little to establish that she frequents the association. In addition, I find that the information in the letter contradicts the testimony of the Appellant. In his letter, the person states that the Appellant \"is very dedicated member, whenever we have group meeting or online discussions, she always find time to participate.\"40 However, in her oral testimony, the Appellant mentioned that she only prays at the temple on the special days. She also never mentioned that she has online discussions with the members of the associations, noting only that because she works and has to cook after work and commute for two hours from work to her home in North York, she does not have time to pray twice a day.41\n[35] Finally, the RPD addressed the two photos which the Appellant submitted into evidence. With respect to the first one, the Appellant testified that it is a photo of a protest, in which a group of people are holding a banner,42 which she had found on the internet. In the Appellant's testimony, she stated that it shows that there is no freedom. However, since the banner is written in Vietnamese and has not been translated, the RPD decided to give the photo little probative value in establishing the Appellant's religious identity as alleged.43\n[36] With respect to the second photo,44 according to the RPD, in her testimony, the Appellant stated that the photo had been taken at her temple by someone and that it was shared by a member of the group. When the RPD inquired who had shared it with her, she responded that it was a member of the Hoa Hao group without further details. The RPD found her explanation evasive. Moreover, the RPD pointed out that the Appellant is not in the photo and that there was no indication of where and when it was taken. Hence, the RPD found that it has little probative value in establishing the credibility of the Appellant's allegations that her religious identity is as alleged.45\n[37] I agree with the RPD's decision to assign little weight to the photos in establishing the credibility of the Appellant's allegation that she is a practicing Hoa Hao follower. According to the RPD rules, evidence must be submitted to the Board in either English or French. There is also no information, such as where and when it was taken to establish that it was indeed taken at the temple as alleged. Nor is she in any of those photos. I also agree with the RPD that the Appellant was evasive in her response when the panel inquired as to whom had shared this picture with her, and that she did not provide details that were reasonably available to someone who alleges to be an active member of the association.\n[38] Given all the above, I find that after considering the totality of the evidence before me, that the RPD is correct that the Appellant has not established with sufficient and persuasive evidence her religious identity as a Hoa Hao practitioner since 2016,46 and which is a central aspect of her claim.\n[39] Even if I were to accept that she is a Hoa Hao religion practitioner, I do not find that she has established that she would be at risk of persecution (on a serious possibility standard) if she returns to Vietnam because she is an adherent to the faith. In reaching my conclusion, and in the absence of country documentation from the Appellant, I have examined the NDP-related evidence. While there is information about harassment independent Hoa Hao groups as opposed to state-recognised Hoa Hao Buddhist groups,47 it is important to recall that the Appellant has never clarified in her testimony whether she belonged to the independent Hoa Hao groups or to the state recognized ones. Moreover, another source underlines that Hoa Hao Buddhism in itself is the fourth-largest religion in Vietnam after Buddhism with an estimated 1.3-2 million followers and therefore not banned in its entirety.48\n[40] Moreover, one NDP source (item 1.5) states that according to one Hoa Hao manager, Hoa Hao members outside of Vietnam would not be at risk if they returned and that the government \"only targets those who are struggling for the legitimate interests of the pure sect.\"49 It also states that authorities are not afraid of individual activists but are most wary of people making associations or organizing themselves into a political party or people calling for a demonstration on the street.50 According to another NDP source, the government is suspicious of large gathering and will look for ways to break them up and could therefore charge people with public disturbance, or those who openly criticize the government or participate in activities that may be perceived to be political in nature. However, even in this case, \"sources indicate that there are very few people detained or imprisoned.\"51\n[41] I do not find that based on the Appellant's testimony that she has alleged being a political party member, or alleged that she was involved in calling for demonstrations or a member of the pure sect. Nor has she alleged that she has in the past sought to organize herself or called for organizing others. I, therefore, do not find that the objective country documentation lends support to the Appellant's allegations that she would have a serious possibility of persecution if she returns to Vietnam just by the virtue of being a Hoa Hao religion practicing individual or that there is a prospective risk of a section 97(1) harm. I reach this conclusion after having determined that the Appellant has not established that she is wanted by Vietnamese police as she alleges and that hence, there is little support that she would be persecuted or harmed by them in the future if she returns there.\n(2) The RPD's conclusions that the Appellant has not established that on a balance of probabilities she is wanted by the Vietnamese police authorities\n(a) that the Appellant sent the photos to her neighbor friend leading to her arrest by the police\n[42] In its decision, the RPD referred to the Appellant's testimony that the police authorities in Vietnam are looking for her because she sent photos to a friend in Vietnam and will be arrested when she returns.52 The panel then asked the Appellant if she had any evidence that she sent the photos to her friend that led her to being wanted by the police. In response, the Appellant testified that she sent the photos through Viber, but that she no longer uses it, so she does not have a record of it.\n[43] When the RPD then asked her if she made any effort to re-activate her account to retrieve it, the Appellant testified that she did not try so she does not know if she would be able to do so. She also testified that she has not used Viber in a long time so does not know if she can still log in and does not use it anymore because she did not know some people.53 The RPD did not find the explanation furnished by the Appellant to be reasonable and drew a negative inference from the Appellant's lack of effort in obtaining corroborative evidence. This is because the RPD opined that sending the photos to her neighbor friend is a central allegation to the Appellant's claim. Hence, the panel expected the Appellant to have at the very least, made efforts to obtain corroborative evidence that she had sent it.54\n[44] The RPD provided an explanation for why it rejected the reasons put forward by the Appellant for her failure to provide a copy of the photos she had sent to her friend, and for why the panel decided to draw a negative inference from the lack of effort to retrieve them. In other words, it is not the Appellant's failure to provide a copy of these photos, but the lack of genuine efforts to do so. I find that the RPD did not err in expecting the Appellant to make this effort to retrieve the material as a reasonable course of action. This is because the sending of these photos to her neighbor friend in Vietnam is a central aspect of the Appellant's claim that she would be persecuted by the police in Vietnam if she returns and they are the reason why they are still looking for her at present.\n[45] Additionally, I note that in her written testimony, the Appellant testified that her mother informed her in XXXX 2019 that the police had arrested her friend and other Buddhists because the police had found material that she, the Appellant, had sent from overseas; that the police found out she was involved and had come into possession of this material.55 However, in her oral testimony, the Appellant testified that the material she sent back home consists of a photo in which people are raising the yellow flag with the three red stripes;56 that it is \"from the previous government before 1975 so it is against the government, so that is why..I did not realize that would cause trouble.\"57 However, the only information that is available in the NDP on Vietnam with respect to this flag, and any consequences people may face for displaying it is the following: \"The yellow and red flag of the former country of South Vietnam is sensitive and cannot be displayed publicly.\"58 The Appellant never testified that her friend displayed it publicly, nor that she, the Appellant, had sent any material other than this photo to her neighbor friend. I do not find that the objective country documentation supports her allegation that on a balance of probabilities, her friend was arrested by the Vietnamese authorities because of this one photo or that they are looking for the Appellant because she sent this photo by Viber to her friend.\n(b) the Appellant's failure to provide corroborative evidence that the police are still looking for her\n[46] In its decision, the RPD inquired with the Appellant why she had not provided a letter from her mother, to whom she spoke once every one to two weeks, to corroborate her claim that she is wanted by the police, or that her uncle attempted to resolve the Appellant's issue with the police. The RPD did not accept as reasonable, the Appellant's explanation for why she failed to provide corroborative evidence given that it represents a core aspect of her claim; that she received the notice to appear many months before (XXXX 2021); was represented by experienced Counsel when she filed her claim in 2020 and that therefore would have been reasonably aware of the need to provide corroborative evidence. The RPD also underscored that these documents would have been reasonably available to the Appellant with reasonable effort, and that the Appellant's mother and uncle would have been well positioned to provide corroborative evidence as they were the only alleged witnesses to the Appellant's allegations. Hence, the RPD found that the Appellant failed to establish that on a balance of probabilities she is wanted by the police in Vietnam as she alleges.59\n[47] In his post-hearing submissions to the RPD, Counsel submitted the following documents on behalf of the Appellant to the RPD and which are: (1) a letter of support from the Appellant's mother (dated XXXX XXXX, 2022); a letter from M. XXXX XXXX the wife of the Appellant's uncle stating that he passed away on XXXX XXXX, 2021 (dated XXXX XXXX, 2022) and (3) a copy of a marriage certificate between Ms. XXXX and the Appellant's uncle.\n[48] While I am mindful that on appeal, the Appellant did not challenge this, I find that the RPD erred in not considering those documents before it rendered its decision, or at least explaining why it did not consider them. An Appellant providing documents tardively is not one and the same as not providing them at all and the RPD should have acknowledged in its decision that the Appellant submitted evidence post-RPD hearing and before it rendered its decision. Thus, when reading the RPD decision, one gets the impression that no evidence was submitted in the first place from the mother and with respect to the uncle which is not the case. Nevertheless, I have rectified this error by conducting my own independent assessment of the evidence.\n[49] In the case of the mother's letter of support,60 the letter provides scarce information towards the Appellant's allegations. It only states that the mother is sad that she is not currently with the Appellant and that she and the father feel heartache whenever the police \"keeps coming for you\"; that she misses her and that it has been 5 years since the day the Appellant left. However, the mother provides no explanation as to why the police keeps coming for the Appellant or any information as her interactions with them. I, therefore, find that the letter is insufficient to establish that the Vietnamese police are looking for the Appellant because of her faith or political opinion (imputed or otherwise) because of the photo with the flag that the Appellant allegedly sent to her neighbor friend. Nor is there information that suggests that the Appellant would face a prospective risk of harm at the hands of the Vietnamese police, including torture or ill-treatment regardless of the reason for which they are looking for her.\n[50] With respect to the uncle, I recall that the Appellant had alleged in her oral and written testimony that he sought to activate all his connections in order to try and \"settle down this matter.\"61 However, the other letter of support that the Appellant submitted to the RPD post-hearing was written by the uncle's wife and who according to the listing of the evidence by Counsel, is the Appellant's aunt (sister of the Appellant's mother). The letter states that her husband, has tried to find all possible ways to help the Appellant and that the police are still coming looking for the Appellant.62 It also states that the uncle passed away on XXXX XXXX, 2021.\n[51] However, for the following reasons, I give little weight to the letter in establishing the Appellant's allegation that the police continue to look for her because of her religion or political opinion (imputed or otherwise). In her letter, the Appellant's aunt does not provide any information that supports the Appellant's allegation that the uncle was trying to help the Appellant because of her religious or political opinion and\/or affiliation (real or perceived). The letter also states that the police are still looking for the Appellant without any further details as to the reason. Thus, while I am ready to accept that the police may be looking for the Appellant, I do not find that this letter provides sufficient evidence to establish that they are looking for her in order to persecute her for a nexus to a Refugee Convention ground, or that on a balance of probabilities, she would be subjected to a section 97 harm by the police if they detain her.\nCONCLUSION\n[52] The Appellant has not credibly established that there is a serious possibility of persecution or that on a balance of probabilities she would face a section 97(1) harm if she returns to Vietnam.\n[53] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nRouba Al-Salem\nRouba Al-Salem\nJanuary 9, 2023\nDate\n1 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, RPD decision at paras 3 and 25.\n2 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, The Appellant's written narrative attached to her Basic of Claim (BoC) form.\n3 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, RPD decision at para. 4.\n4 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, RPD decision at para. 17.\n5 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, RPD decision at paras 18 and 20-23.\n6 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, The Appellant's Memorandum of Appeal at paras. 14-15.\n7 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, The Appellant's Memorandum of Appeal at paras. 16 and 18.\n8 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, The Appellant's written statement submitted to the RAD.\n9 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of Nigeria. He appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] The Appellant fears persecution from his maternal family (a Royal Family), persons associated with the Royal Palace, traditionalists, the community, and the police in XXXX, in the Ikole Local Government Area of Ekiti State, who perceived and accused the Appellant of being gay. The Appellant also fears persecution from his Muslim family, being his maternal family, and the Muslim community in XXXX due to the Appellant's conversion from Islam to Christianity, specifically to the Catholic faith. The Appellant further fears persecution from the chieftaincy community for having refused a chieftaincy position associated with his paternal lineage.\n[3] In a March 16, 2022, RPD Decision, the RPD rejected the claim, finding that the Appellant's claim is not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, to be credible, and that the Appellant has three viable Internal Flight Alternatives (IFA) within Nigeria in Abuja, Port Harcourt and Lagos City. On appeal, the Appellant submits that the partial recording of the RPD Hearing accounts for a breach of procedural fairness, and the RPD's conclusions regarding the Appellant's credibility and IFA are not reasonable.1 I have applied the appropriate standard of correctness in my analysis of the RPD Decision. I disagree with the Appellant's arguments. I find that the determinative issue is credibility and that the RPD did not err in its credibility assessment.\nDECISION\n[4] The appeal is dismissed, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2 The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention3 refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNO NEW EVIDENCE OR ORAL HEARING\n[5] The Appellant did not submit any new evidence to be considered under section 110(4)4 of the IRPA. There being no new evidence in this case, I have no jurisdiction to hold an oral hearing under section 110(6)5 of the IRPA.\nNO BREACH OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS\n[6] I disagree with the Appellant that the partial recording of the RPD Hearing, which lacks Counsel's questioning of the Appellant and Counsel's submissions, constitutes a breach of procedural fairness.6\n[7] There is no statutory right to a recording or transcript of the RPD proceedings. However, the Federal Court has said:\n[W]here the fundamental issues at stake concern the reasonableness of the assessment of the credibility of a witness by an administrative tribunal, and where the absence of a record of the testimony of the concerned witness leads to the conclusion that the Court cannot deal adequately with the concerns raised, then a new hearing may be required.7\n[8] Although the role of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is not the same as that of the Federal Court, the Court has found that the same principles apply to the RAD's review of a decision by the RPD in the absence of a complete record.8 Whether the RAD is able to properly dispose of an appeal in the absence of a complete record is a decision that is made on a case-by-case basis.\n[9] In this case, there were two sittings of the RPD Hearing: January 12, 2022, and March 3, 2022. The record includes two audio recordings for the January 12, 2022, sitting and three audio recordings for the March 3, 2022, sitting. However, the third audio recording for the March 3, 2022, sitting does not have any audio. I note that the Member completed her questioning of the Appellant at the end of the second audio recording for the March 3, 2022, sitting. The third audio recording would have essentially covered Counsel's questioning of the Appellant and Counsel's submissions.\n[10] As discussed in the next section, I find that the determinative issue is credibility. Based on my review of the record and the Appellant's arguments on appeal, I conclude that the absence of the third audio recording for the March 3, 2022, sitting does not prevent me from adequately assessing the evidence and the correctness of the RPD Decision. I find that the record before me documents the Appellant's evidence on which the RPD relied in making its credibility findings sufficiently to enable me to consider the Appellant's arguments and assess the correctness of the RPD's credibility findings.9\n[11] The Federal Court has found that the absence of a complete record of the proceedings will not necessarily mean that an appellant's procedural fairness rights on appeal have been breached.10 I acknowledge the Appellant's submission that the incomplete recording of the RPD Hearing makes it impossible for Counsel to properly establish what transpired at the RPD Hearing and prevents Counsel from offering proper and complete submissions in an ethical manner on the Appellant's behalf.11 However, for the reasons discussed above, I find that the incomplete recording did not prevent the Appellant from meaningfully exercising his right of appeal, nor has the Appellant submitted or demonstrated that there is any serious possibility of an error on the record.12 As a result, I find that the incomplete recording of the RPD Hearing does not constitute a breach of procedural fairness.\nANALYSIS\n[12] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.13 I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence. While I acknowledge all of the Appellant's arguments, I will address only those that are determinative of the outcome of this appeal.\n[13] I find that the determinative issue is credibility. I further find that the RPD did not err in its credibility assessment. Accordingly, I agree with and confirm the RPD's finding that the claim is not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, to be credible, as a result of which the forward-looking risk threshold in section 96 of the IRPA is not satisfied, nor, in the alternative, the forward-looking risk threshold in section 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[14] The Appellant submits that the RPD's conclusions pertaining to his credibility are not reasonable as the RPD drew adverse credibility findings from minor inconsistencies from the Appellant's testimony, his Basis of Claim (BOC) form and narrative. I disagree. Given that the appropriate standard of review is correctness, I find that the RPD did not err in this regard. My reasons follow.\nBOC relating to perceived sexual orientation\n[15] I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant has not credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, the basis of his claim that he is perceived to be gay. The panel referred to the following credibility issues, considered cumulatively.\nMaterial inconsistency regarding when the Appellant was detained at the palace\n[16] The panel noted that in his BOC narrative, the Appellant wrote that he was imprisoned at the\npalace \"precisely from the year 2003-2009.\" However, according to his initial testimony, he was\narrested in 2002. He confirmed the panel's understanding that he was locked up in the palace from 2002 to 2009. When the panel noted for the Appellant that he provided different information in a\nform that he signed, he interjected that he was in jail in 2003. When asked to explain his earlier answer of 2002, the Appellant said he was nervous and depressed.\n[17] I disagree with the Appellant that this is a minor inconsistency which should not impact his credibility.14 I find that the year the Appellant was locked up at the palace due to the belief that he is gay is a material element of his claim. Moreover, given that the Appellant was abused and tortured while imprisoned in the palace for seven years, it is reasonable to expect him to remember the year he was locked up at the palace. I acknowledge the Appellant's submission that a refugee claim is not a memory test such that the inconsistency pertaining to the date of the Appellant's detention should not be the foundation for an adverse credibility finding.15 However, I find that the date the Appellant was locked up at the palace is not a peripheral matter and, therefore, the RPD asking about it may not be considered a mere memory test.\n[18] I also disagree with the Appellant that the panel did not reasonably consider the explanation that the Appellant was nervous and depressed during his testimony.16 I note that the panel considered the explanation but found that it does not credibly allay its concern about the inconsistency. The reasons for the RPD's finding are set out in paragraph 15 of the RPD Decision. I agree with and confirm the RPD's finding for the same reasons provided by the RPD.\nMaterial inconsistency with the personal history in the Schedule A Form\n[19] The panel noted that according to Question 8 of the Schedule A Form, the Appellant indicated that he was unemployed in XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX 2003 to XXXX 2010. The panel also noted for the Appellant that Question 8 gives sample answers including \"in detention.\" When asked to explain why he did not indicate that he was at such time in detention at the palace, the Appellant\nexplained that he was under pressure, made a mistake, and had totally forgotten what he was\nsupposed to write in the form.\n[20] The Appellant submits that the fact that he was unemployed from XXXX 2003 to XXXX 2010 is not erroneous given that he was detained; hence, the fact that he indicated that he was unemployed should not lead to an adverse credibility finding as it does not contradict his testimony.17 I am not persuaded by the Appellant's argument. Question 8 of the Schedule A Form clearly states that \"If you were not working, provide information on what you were doing (for example: unemployed, studying, travelling, retired, in detention, etc.). I find that the Appellant understood the meaning of being unemployed when he indicated \"unemployed\" for various time periods when he was unemployed in the United States (U.S.). As such, it is reasonable to expect the Appellant to indicate that he was \"in detention\" and not \"unemployed\" from XXXX 2003 to XXXX 2010, as being in detention is not the same as being unemployed in the context of his entire personal history.\n[21] I disagree with the Appellant that the panel did not take into consideration the explanation provided by him to explain his answer.18 The Appellant explained that he was under pressure, made a mistake, and had totally forgotten what he was supposed to write in the form. I note that the panel considered the explanation but found that it does not credibly allay its concern about the inconsistency. The reasons for the RPD's finding are set out in paragraph 17 of the RPD Decision. I agree with and confirm the RPD's finding for the same reasons provided by the RPD.\nMaterial inconsistency with the Appellant's father's death certificate\n[22] I disagree with the Appellant that his knowledge of the administrative entity that delivers death certificates in Nigeria is irrelevant to the case at bar such that it should not impact his credibility.19 As noted by the panel, the Appellant's explanation is not credible, considering that the death certificate is issued by The National Population Commission (NPC), not the courts. The Appellant submits that his uncle confirms that the death certificate was obtained from the NPC rather than from the courts. However, having considered the evidence, and regardless of the entity that issued the Appellant's father's death certificate, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant's father is deceased, but not in the circumstances as alleged by the Appellant. Accordingly, the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant's allegation of his father having been killed after helping the Appellant flee the palace at which he was being held due to the belief that he is gay is therefore not credibly established, on a balance of probabilities. As a result, the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant's perceived sexual orientation is materially undermined.\nBOC relating to religion\nThe account of the alleged conversion is vague\n[23] The Appellant submits that when he mentioned that he converted himself \"probably in 200l\" he was clearly trying to reconstitute the events and established that he probably converted in 2001 as it was prior to his detention in the Royal Palace. The Appellant also submits that the lengthy passage of time since the event can reasonably explain the manner by which the Appellant responded to the\npanel's question.20 I find that the Appellant's explanation is not reasonable. Considering that the Appellant's conversion to Christianity is a significant personal experience, it is reasonable to expect the Appellant, even with the lengthy passage of time, to remember the exact year of his conversion.\nThe Appellant is not baptized\n[24] The Appellant submits that the fact that he convinced himself to follow God is a reasonable explanation of the process through which he became Christian.21 I am not persuaded by the Appellant's argument. When the panel noted to the Appellant that baptism is a very important sacrament in the Catholic faith, the Appellant responded that he has never really thought about it, adding that maybe when his daughter is baptized, he will also get baptized. Considering that baptism is a very important sacrament in the Catholic faith, I find that the Appellant's explanation is not reasonable. Further, it is reasonable to expect the Appellant to have been baptized into the Catholic faith while in Nigeria, the U.S. or in Canada, if he had, in fact, converted to Catholicism.\nThe Appellant has not attended a Catholic church in Canada, nor any church in Canada\n[25] The Appellant submits that the RPD's conclusion that he has not attended a Catholic church in Canada while he did in the U.S. is unreasonable as it is not for the RPD to determine whether or not the Appellant is truly Christian on the sole basis of his baptism or his attendance in church.22 I am not persuaded by the Appellant's argument. The Appellant fears persecution due to his conversion from Islam to Christianity, specifically to the Catholic faith. As such, it is the RPD's task to make findings of fact to determine if the Appellant's allegation of persecution is credible.\nUndisputed findings\n[26] The RPD found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant was not asked to take a chieftaincy position and he was not drawn into a chieftaincy tussle. The RPD further found that his account does not support the forward-looking risk threshold under section 96 or section 97(1) of the IRPA. The Appellant does not dispute this aspect of the RPD Decision. Having considered the evidence, I agree with and confirm the RPD's finding for the same reasons provided by the RPD. The RPD's finding is correct.\n[27] In my independent assessment, and for all the above reasons, the RPD was correct in finding that considered cumulatively, the claim is not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, to be credible, as a result of which the forward-looking risk threshold in section 96 of the IRPA is not satisfied, nor, in the alternative, the forward-looking risk threshold in section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that the Appellant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish the central allegations of his claim. Accordingly, the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee\npursuant to section 96 of the IRPA or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of\nthe IRPA.\n[29] The appeal is dismissed. I confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nLiza Guevara\nLiza Guevara\nMarch 10, 2023\nDate\n1 Appellant's Record, Appellant's Memorandum, at pp. 34, 35 and 38-39 [Memorandum].\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, section 111(1)(a).\n3 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n4 IRPA, section 110 (4).\n5 Ibid., section 110 (6).\n6 Supra., at footnote 1, Memorandum, at p. 34, para. 7.\n7 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated April 1, 2022, rejecting his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in assessing his claim and asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow his appeal and determine that he is a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA). The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL MATTERS\n[3] The Appellant alleges that he fears persecution by the Sri Lankan army because of his membership in the particular social group of Tamil men and because of his perceived political opinion as a supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).2\n[4] At the RPD hearing, the Minister intervened on the issue of the Appellant's identity.\n[5] The RPD found that the Appellant did not credibly establish his personal and national identity.\n[6] On appeal, the Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of his identity.\n[7] As described below, the RAD directed the Appellant's counsel to provide further information regarding allegations against his former counsel, which were received.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\nItem a) is accepted but the other items of new evidence are rejected\nNew evidence tendered before the perfection of the appeal\n[8] The Appellant tendered the following evidence with the perfection of his appeal:\na) Copy of pages of Sri Lanka Passport no.

Cairncross et al., A Finite Element Formulation for Modeling Dynamic Wetting on Flexible Substrates and in Deformable Porous Media, Sandia National Laboratories, 2004.27\n[9] Under section 110(4) of the IRPA, the Appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of his claim or that was not reasonably available at the time of the rejection, or that he could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection.28 If the evidence meets one of these requirements, I must consider whether it passes the tests of credibility, relevance and newness affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh.29\nItems b), e), g), n), s), u) and v)\n[10] I note that items b), e), g), n), s), u) and v) were previously provided to the RPD prior to the hearing. Item b) is a copy of the Appellant's National Identity Card (NIC) along with an English translation, which appears twice in the RPD Record.30 Although the translation into English has been done by a different translator in item b), the information is the same. Also found in the RPD Record are copies of: the XXXX report at item e);31 the Appellant's marriage certificate at item g);32 the RPD Notice of Decision at item n);33 the Convention Refugee Claim Notice of Decision at item s);34 the US Notice of Credible Fear Interview at item u);35 and the US Notice to Appear at item v).36 Because these items are already present in the RPD record, they are not accepted as new evidence.\nItem a) is accepted\n[11] Item a) is a copy of pages in a passport issued to XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2009, the second of the three passports discussed at the RPD hearing, where the Appellant testified that he had given this passport to the agent in Sri Lanka and that his wife had been unable to contact the agent to get it back because they were not answering the phone.37 In tendering item a), he submits that he found the copy of the passport only after the hearing and presented it to his new counsel, who advised him to provide it as new evidence.38\n[12] The Appellant provides no details as to how he came to locate the copy of this passport after the hearing. However, accepting his submission at face value, I find that he could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented item a) at the time of the rejection if he was not able to find it until after the hearing. As a result, item a) satisfies the test in section 110(4) of the IRPA. I further find that that it meets the factors in Singh because: it is credible, considering that the passport copy appears to be a genuine document issued by the Sri Lankan government; relevant, in the sense that it is capable of proving or disproving a fact related to the issue of the Appellant's identity; and new in the sense that it is capable of contradicting a finding of fact made by the RPD regarding evolving testimony concerning his second passport. Therefore, I accept item a) as new evidence.\nItems c) and f) are rejected\n[13] Regarding items c) and f) below, the Appellant's counsel submits that his previous counsel did not advise him to provide documentation attesting to his travels between Sri Lanka and Qatar, did not ask if he had other proof of his identity issued by the Government of Qatar, and did not indicate to the RPD that he needed an accommodation due to his XXXX XXXX XXXX, meaning that the Appellant did not answer the RPD's questions clearly and consistently. The Appellant's counsel argues that the Appellant was not well advised by his previous counsel and could not have know that his impairment could affect his credibility.39\n[14] To make an allegation against former counsel at the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), the Appellant must establish that: his former counsel's acts or omissions constituted incompetence; he was prejudiced by their former counsel's actions, resulting in a miscarriage of justice;40 and he followed the steps required by the IRB's Practice Notice - Allegations Against Former Counsel.41 These steps include providing former counsel with a copy of the Appellant's Memorandum or other document that contains the allegations, and a written notice that former counsel has ten days after receiving the allegations to provide a response. In this case, the Appellant provided no evidence or submissions with his appeal record indicating that he had informed his former counsel of the allegations against him.\n[15] On December 8, 2022, the RAD directed the Appellant's counsel to provide a response indicating whether his former counsel had been notified of the allegations pursuant to the Practice Notice and, if so, to provide to the RAD the required documents listed in para. 6 a) to c) of the Practice Notice.42 On December 21, 2022, the RAD received a response from the Appellant's counsel, indicating that his former counsel had been notified of the allegations on December 16, 2022, and provided with the related documents.43\n[16] On December 18, 2022, the RAD received a letter in reply from the Appellant's former counsel,44 in which he indicated that he had told the Appellant to get documents for his case, including identity documents. In particular, the former counsel stated as follows:\nAs regards the identity documents, I was very clear about the importance of providing the Board with valid identity documents, including passports, National I.D. document, driver's license, education documents and any other proofs pertaining to identity. I could not get the documents for him. It was his responsibility to do so. The case of course turned on identity, and I did all I could to urge him to get all the genuine I.D. documents he could.45\n[17] Having reviewed the letter from the Appellant's former counsel and having received no response from the Appellant to his former counsel's statements concerning the allegations, I do not accept the Appellant's argument that he did not provide these items of new evidence to the RPD because he did not receive proper guidance from his previous counsel. Also regarding whether his XXXX XXXX affected his credibility, I note that the RPD member was advised of this and instructed the Appellant to let them know at any time if he had difficulty hearing or needed a question repeated.46 The Appellant did not raise any such concerns during the hearing.47 Therefore, I find that the Appellant has not established that these items of evidence were not reasonably available at the time of the rejection of his claim, or that he could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented them at the time of the rejection. As a result, these items are rejected as new evidence.\nItems d), h), i), j), k), l), m), o), p) and t) are rejected\n[18] The Appellant submits that he has brought forward items o), p) and t) because the RPD questioned him about why he had not provided proof of his brothers' residence in Canada. He submits that he is providing items d), h), i), j), k), l), and m) because they consistently include the names of various family members in relationship to him, including his wife, parents, brothers, and children.\n[19] I find that the evidence in items d), h), i), j), k), l), m), o), p) and t) was available to the Appellant prior the rejection of his claim but he did not provide it until after the claim was rejected. Section 110(4) of the IRPA is not intended to allow a claimant to wait for a negative decision before they produce evidence of their identity. In the Appellant's case, he has provided no reasonable explanation as to why he could not have provided these items prior to the rejection of his claim. Identity is always at issue in a refugee claim and the Minister intervened in the Appellant's claim on the issue of identity. As discussed above, the Appellant's former counsel states that he advised the Appellant to provide all documents relating to his identity. As a result, I find that items d), h), i), j), k), l), m), o), p) and t) do not satisfy section 110(4).\nItems q) and r) are rejected\n[20] The Appellant submits that he is seeking to introduce items q) and r) to prove that he possessed his second passport and used it to travel to Sri Lanka for his brother's wedding in XXXX 2017.\n[21] I find that items q) and r) satisfy section 110(4) because the Appellant could not reasonably have been expected to have presented these items at the time of the rejection given that they relate to the RPD's finding that he provided evolving testimony about the second passport, which he could not have anticipated. However, I further find that they are not relevant under the Singh factor of relevance because I have accepted the passport, which is item a), into evidence. Therefore, I do not need to accept additional new evidence addressing the RPD's negative finding on item a) given that I have admitted this evidence.\nItems w), x) and y) are rejected\n[22] Item w) is a copy of the NIC of an individual named XXXX XXXX. The Appellant submits that this item has been put forward to show that the same security feature that is missing from the Appellant's NIC is also missing on this document and asserts that the missing feature is not the result of tampering or forgery but a defect in printing methods. Item x) is a power point presentation that provides technical information on various defects found in lamination and item y) is a report about problems with the quality of products coated in liquid solutions. The Appellant submits that the power point presentation and report demonstrate that a defect in the lamination produced an air bubble on the Appellant's NIC.\n[23] I find that the Appellant could have anticipated that the RPD would make a negative finding with respect to his NIC because he was questioned at the hearing about why the number was missing on his NIC.48 Therefore, the Appellant could reasonably have been expected to have presented items w), x) and y) before the rejection of the claim because there was more than one month between the final RPD hearing date of March 3, 2022 and the date that notice of the RPD's April 1, 2022 decision was provided to the Appellant on April 5, 2022. Therefore, I find that these items do not satisfy section 110(4) of the IRPA.\nNew evidence tendered after the perfection of the appeal\n[24] The Appellant tendered the following evidence after perfecting the appeal:\nz) Copy of Sri Lankan Register of Birth certificate no. XXXX, with English translation, for XXXX, born XXXX XXXX, 1974, at Government Hospital, XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX;49\naa) Copy of Sri Lankan Register of Birth certificate no. XXXX, with English translation, for XXXX, born XXXX XXXX, 1998, at Government Hospital, XXXX to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX;50\nbb) Copy of Police Clearance Certificate, issued to XXXX XXXX, on XXXX XXXX, 2022, for the period of his stay in Qatar- XXXX XXXX, 2014, to XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017;51\ncc) Copy of Sri Lankan Register of Birth no. XXXX, with English translation, for XXXX, born XXXX XXXX, 1974, at Government Hospital, XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX;52 and\ndd) Copy of Sri Lankan Register of Birth no. XXXX, with English translation, for XXXX, born XXXX XXXX XXXX 1979, at Government Hospital, XXXX to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.53\n[25] In deciding whether to admit new evidence after the perfection of an appeal, Rule 29(4) of the RAD Rules requires me to first consider any relevant factors, including: the document's relevance and probative value; any new evidence the document brings to the appeal; and whether the Appellant, with reasonable effort, could have provided the document with his appeal record.54 If the evidence meets the Rule 29 application factors, I must then assess it under section 110(4) and the tests in Singh.55\n[26] With respect to item bb), the Appellant made the same submissions as he did regarding items c) and f) above, arguing that his previous counsel did not advise him properly. For the same reasons as above, I find that, regardless of whether this evidence meets the Rule 29 factors, the Appellant has not established that it was not reasonably available at the time of the rejection of his claim, or that he could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it at the time of the rejection.\n[27] Items z), aa) and dd) are similar to items d), h), i), j), k), l) and m) above in that they are provided to demonstrate the Appellant's relationship to various family members. Even if these items were to meet the factors in Rule 29, I find for the same reasons as set out above that they do not satisfy section 110(4) because they were available to the Appellant prior the rejection of his claim but were not provided until after the claim was rejected.\n[28] I note that, despite item d) having a different description on the Appellant's list of exhibits, item cc) is identical to item d), which I have addressed above.56 As a result, I need not address item cc) as new evidence.\n[29] Therefore, items z), aa), bb), cc) and dd) are rejected as new evidence.\nAn oral hearing is not required\n[30] Under s. 110(6) of the IRPA, the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is new evidence that: raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal; is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[31] The Appellant requested an oral hearing. Having admitted item a), I have assessed whether an oral hearing should be held. I find that, given my reasons set out below, item a) is not evidence that would justify allowing or rejecting the Appellant's claim.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE\n[32] The determinative issue is identity.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[33] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.57 I have carried out my own independent analysis of the evidence to determine whether the RPD erred.\nANALYSIS\n[34] For the following reasons, I find that the Appellant has not established his personal and national identity.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellant's NIC is not genuine and that his driver's licence was obtained using the NIC\n[35] The RPD found that the Appellant's NIC was not a genuine Sri Lankan NIC because it is missing a purple-coloured number on the top right corner and because a Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) document examiner concluded that the document was most likely altered. The RPD found that, while there were no abnormalities in the Appellant's driver's licence, it did not establish his identity because he submitted his NIC as evidence of identity to obtain it, making the driver's licence a fraudulently obtained document. The RPD noted that document fraud is common in Sri Lanka.\n[36] The Appellant submits that his NIC is genuine but has defects, and that he has presented another NIC with a missing security feature, which is not the result of tampering or forgery but a defect in printing methods when issued. He submits that identity documents issued by a foreign government are presumed to be valid unless evidence is produced to prove otherwise, and that the fact that a mark of genuineness is missing does not necessarily mean an identity card is forged. The Appellant submits that the RPD should not have concluded that his identity documents were obtained fraudulently merely because it was possible for them to be fraudulently obtained.\n[37] The objective country condition evidence states that NICs issued in Sri Lanka before January 1, 2016 have a purple-coloured number at the top right, indicating the province in which the NIC application was made.58 The Appellant's NIC, which was issued on XXXX XXXX XXXX 1995,59 does not have a purple number, one of the few security features noted in the objective evidence about NICs.60 When the RPD member questioned the Appellant at the hearing about this missing number, he testified that the number may have been erased because he was stopped frequently by the army to show the card when he was working at transporting sand and had wet hands. He said he did not know why the full number had been completely erased.61 I find, as the RPD did, that the Appellant's explanation was not reasonable because the NIC is a laminated document, and it is highly unlikely that an important security feature would be completely erased from the NIC when the other information on it continues to be plainly visible.\n[38] The Minister provided a CBSA summary examination report of an analysis of the NIC by a documents examiner who observed that: paper fibers were disturbed on the back of the document, suggesting data erasure; there was an air bubble under the plastic laminate; and the ultraviolet features did not comply with the sample document. The documents examiner concluded that the NIC was most likely altered.62 While this was not a formal laboratory report, the document examiner's resume indicates that they were well qualified, with training and two levels of certification, and approximately 13 years of experience.63 As a result, I give significant weight to the summary examination report. When questioned by the RPD member about this report, the Appellant did not have any explanation as to why it appeared that the fibres on the back of the document had been disturbed. Instead, he stated that when he used the NIC to obtain a passport, he was never told to get a new NIC.64\n[39] I note that the Appellant sought to have admitted into evidence technical information about defects in lamination problems with products coated in liquid solutions. Even if I had accepted this general technical information into evidence, I find that it would not have outweighed the CBSA report, in which a qualified document examiner specifically analyzed the Appellant's NIC.\n[40] I also note that the Appellant tendered a copy of another individual's NIC, which is also missing the purple number, that was not accepted into evidence. However, even if this item was in evidence, I find that it would not be probative to establish that the missing number on the Appellant's card is the result of a defect in printing methods, given that the Appellant provided no contextual information about the other NIC, which could itself be fraudulent.\n[41] Given the missing security feature on the Appellant's NIC and the analysis in the CBSA report, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the NIC is an altered, fraudulent document, and I assign no weight to it.\n[42] With respect to the Appellant's Sri Lankan driver's licence,65 which he testified he presented his NIC to obtain,66 I have reviewed the RPD's finding that the driver's licence is a fraudulently obtained document because he used his altered NIC to obtain it, and I agree with this finding. The Appellant did not make any arguments that contested this finding specifically.\n[43] I find that the copy of the Appellant's passport,67 which has been admitted as new evidence, is also a fraudulently obtained document. The Appellant testified that he submitted his NIC to obtain his passport.68\n[44] I note that the passport would also have been used to obtain other identification documents fraudulently, such as the Qatar driver's licence that the Appellant sought to admit as new evidence evidence.\n[45] I have considered the Appellant's argument that the RPD based its conclusion that his identity documents were obtained fraudulently on general evidence about document fraud in Sri Lanka. The country condition evidence does state that document fraud is common in Sri Lanka.69 While it would have been an error to base its conclusions solely on this general statement, I find that the RPD did not do this. Instead, the RPD correctly considered the objective evidence about document fraud generally in Sri Lanka along with the specific evidence relating to the Appellant's identity documents that indicated his NIC had been altered.\nThe RPD correctly found that the birth and marriage certificates do not establish identity\n[46] The RPD found that the Appellant's birth certificate and marriage certificate did not bear his photo, and that the translation of the birth certificate did not appear to correspond to the original birth certificate provided. The RPD gave these documents no weight in establishing the Appellant's identity.\n[47] The Appellant submits that clerical or printing errors are not necessarily determinative of authenticity, and that the birth certificate should not be given no weight because it does not include a photograph but can be considered corroborative evidence. He submits that he has provided additional evidence to corroborate his identity.\n[48] While the Appellant's birth certificate and marriage certificate do not include photos, there is no indication in the objective evidence that such documents in Sri Lanka ever have photos attached.70 Therefore, this would not be a sufficient reason to dismiss them in assessing his identity but does mean that they must be given less weight in establishing identity. However, given my finding that the Appellant's NIC is altered, I must weigh this against other identity documents such as the birth and marriage certificates, and I find that they are outweighed by the evidence that the NIC is fraudulent.\nThe RPD did not err in dismissing the Appellant's explanations for not providing other identity documents\n[49] The RPD found that: the Appellant's explanation for not providing his current passport was not credible because he gave evolving testimony about the location of his passport, originally stating that he was questioned in the United States (US) about his visa, and then saying he was questioned about his passport; the passport was not taken from him in Ecuador because, if the passport was taken by an agent in Ecuador, the Appellant would not have directly stated to US authorities that he had his passport with him; and the Appellant's testimony that his first passport was destroyed when the army burned down his family's house in 2009 was implausible because he would not have been in Qatar without his passport.\n[50] The Appellant submits that the US authorities breached the duty of fairness during his credible fear interview because they did not ask him to present his passport or where it was, arguing that if the US official had concerns about his identity, he should have expressed them but did not do so. The Appellant then submits that the RPD breached the duty of fairness by not accepting the decision of the US official that he had determined the Appellant's identity with a reasonable degree of certainty based on the Appellant's own credible statements. The Appellant submits that he did not have his passport in Qatar because he had sent it to Sri Lanka with other personal belongings. The Appellant also submits that there is a presumption of truth for sworn statements, and that his claim should not be dismissed just because some of his evidence is not reliable.\n[51] Regarding the Appellant's submission that the US authorities breached the duty of fairness during his credible fear interview with respect to questioning him about his passport, I find that the RAD is not able to correct such a breach in a different jurisdiction's legal system. However, I note that the Appellant has now produced a copy of a passport that has been accepted into evidence, so this alleged breach of fairness in the US is of no relevance. Similarly, the Appellant's explanation as to why he did not have his passport in Qatar is no longer at issue because a copy of his passport is in evidence.\n[52] I also find that the US official's determination that the Appellant had established his identity with a reasonable degree of certainty based on his own credible statements is not relevant to my independent review of the RPD's decision. I must consider the findings of the RPD and determine whether they are correct based on my analysis of the evidence before me, as I have done in my reasons above.\n[53] Finally, I note the Appellant's submissions that there is a presumption of truth for sworn statement, and that his claim should not be dismissed just because some of his evidence is not reliable. The presumption of truth in a refugee claim may be rebutted where there are discrepancies between their testimony and other evidence,71 as there are in this case based on the altered NIC. Regarding the Appellant's argument that his claim should not be dismissed because some of evidence is unreliable, I note that identity is the determinative issue in this case and identity must be established before going on to an assessment of whether the evidence in support of the merits of his claim is reliable.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellant has not established his identity\n[54] Although I did not admit most of the new evidence tendered by the Appellant to establish his identity, I find that it would not have changed my conclusion on his identity even if it had been accepted because none of it would have outweighed by my finding that his NIC is altered and fraudulent.\n[55] Therefore, I conclude that the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellant has not established his personal and national identity as a citizen of Sri Lanka, on a balance of probabilities.\nCONCLUSION\n[56] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nMaureen Carter-Whitney\nMaureen Carter-Whitney\nJanuary 11, 2023\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibits 2 and 7, Basis of Claim (BOC) form, narrative, and amended BOC narrative, at pgs. 12-29.\n3 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 51-57.\n4 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 58-61.\n5 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pg. 62.\n6 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 29, 2022, at pgs. 63-66.\n7 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 67-68.\n8 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pg. 69.\n9 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 70-71.\n10 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 72-75.\n11 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 76-77.\n12 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 82-83.\n13 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 84-85.\n14 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 86-89.\n15 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 91-92.\n16 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pg. 93.\n17 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 94-95.\n18 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pg. 96.\n19 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 97-100.\n20 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 101-109.\n21 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pg. 110.\n22 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pg. 111.\n23 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 112-122.\n24 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 123-138.\n25 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 138-140.\n26 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 149-177.\n27 Exhibit P-3, Amended Appellant's Record, dated June 28, 2022, at pgs. 178-235.\n28 IRPA, s. 110(4).\n29 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He fears persecution or harm if he returns to India from the local police in Punjab state, who allegedly falsely accused him of being a militant separatist.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) identified some credibility concerns, but ultimately rejected the Appellant's claim because they determined that he has a safe and reasonable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Mumbai. The Appellant is appealing the RPD decision. He argues that the RPD's IFA analysis was unreasonable.\n[3] This is the Appellant's second appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). His first appeal was dismissed in July 2022 because he did not perfect his appeal. The Appellant's application to re-open his appeal was granted in September 2022.\n[4] The Appellant has not submitted new evidence in this appeal. The determinative issue in this appeal is whether the RPD erred in its IFA analysis.\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The Appellant has a safe and reasonable IFA in Mumbai. Therefore, the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\nThe request for an oral hearing is refused\n[6] The Appellant's request for an oral hearing is refused. An appeal before the RAD must proceed without an oral hearing1 unless certain requirements are met. An oral hearing is not permissible because the requirements of subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) have not been met. No new evidence was submitted or admitted. Without new evidence, an oral hearing is not permitted.\nBACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS\n[7] The Appellant identifies as a Sikh, and he lived in a village in Punjab state. In 2016, his childhood friend, XXXX XXXX XXXX (MS), was arrested by the police and accused of being a militant. MS eventually went into hiding and the police came to the Appellant's home to question him about MS's whereabouts. The Appellant was not aware where MS was, so he could not assist the police.\n[8] In XXXX 2017, the Appellant went on vacation to Thailand. While he was there, he coincidentally ran into MS. MS asked the Appellant to deliver some clothes and money to his mother back in India.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the Appellant went to deliver the clothes and money to MS's mother at her home. While he was there, the police just happened to raid her home, and they took the Appellant to the police station for questioning about his ties to MS and other militants. The Appellant was detained for XXXX days, tortured, and released upon the payment of a bribe.\n[10] After the Appellant was released, the police came to his home periodically to ask about MS and other militants. In XXXX 2017, the Appellant met with a lawyer to find out if there was anything he could do about his problems with the police. The lawyer told him he needed to get witnesses to the police harassment. Somehow, two days later, the police found out that the Appellant met with a lawyer, and they detained him at the police station for questioning for XXXX days. He was tortured and released upon the payment of a bribe.\n[11] Upon his release, the Appellant went into hiding at a relative's home in Chandigarh. When the police went to the Appellant's home to talk to him in early XXXX 2018, his father told the police where he was. The Appellant moved to a different location in Chandigarh before the police located him. He decided to leave India and paid an agent to help him obtain a Canadian visa. The Appellant came to Canada in XXXX 2018 and claimed refugee protection in June 2018.\nANALYSIS\n[12] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 I have conducted my own independent analysis of the evidence. This included listening to the recording of the RPD hearing and reviewing all of the documents submitted.\n[13] I have considered the most recent version of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India, dated June 30, 2022, in my analysis. This version of the NDP was published before the Appellant perfected his appeal and made his submissions on August 18, 2022. Therefore, the Appellant is deemed to have had knowledge of the updated NDP before making his submissions, and it is not necessary to give notice of my reliance on the updated NDP and provide an opportunity to respond.3 Furthermore, the information in the documents that I have referenced throughout this decision, has not substantially changed since the June 30, 2021 version of the NDP that was in effect at the time of the RPD hearing.\nThe standard of proof\n[14] The nexus or basis for the Appellant's fear of persecution by the Punjab police is his imputed political opinion as an alleged militant separatist. Therefore, the standard of proof is a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution, which is a lower standard or test than a likelihood of harm on a balance of probabilities.\n[15] However, the facts that the Appellant relies on in his claim still must be established on a balance of probabilities. This distinction in the evidentiary burden was set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in determining the test for an IFA, when stating that it must be established, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of persecution in the IFA,4 and no risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\nThe RPD decision\n[16] The RPD identified some credibility concerns and found that the Appellant embellished his testimony to bolster his claim. They found it highly improbable that the Appellant coincidently ran into MS in Thailand, or that the police just happened to raid MS's mother's home on the day that the Appellant visited her. The RPD appears to have accepted that the police questioned the Appellant about his ties to MS. The RPD also identified some concerns with the authenticity of the Appellant's supporting documents. However, they ultimately focused on an IFA in Mumbai as the determinative issue in the claim.\nThe RPD did not err in its IFA analysis\n[17] An IFA means that there is another city or area in India where the Appellant can live safely. If there is an IFA, then the Appellant does not need to seek refuge or safety in Canada. As a result, his claim for refugee protection would be denied since a finding that there is a viable IFA is determinative of a claim, whether it is assessed under section 96 or 97 of the IRPA.\n[18] There is a two-part test to determine if there is an IFA. The IFA must be safe, and it must be reasonable. It is safe if there is no serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, no risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture. It is reasonable if conditions in the IFA are not unduly harsh and do not jeopardize the life or safety of the Appellant. The RPD correctly identified and applied the two-part test.\n[19] In determining safety, the agent of persecution's interest in and ability to find the Appellant is considered. The Appellant's circumstances and the general circumstances in the proposed IFA are also considered.\n[20] In determining reasonableness, the Appellant's personal situation is considered, such as language, religion, ethnicity, education, and ability to earn a living. Establishing unreasonableness requires the existence of conditions in the IFA which would jeopardize the life or safety of the Appellant.5 The Appellant must show actual concrete evidence of such conditions. His belief that he will be in jeopardy is not sufficient.\n[21] The RPD proposed Mumbai as a potential IFA location. Once the RPD proposes a specific IFA, the onus or burden is on the Appellant to establish that the proposed IFA location is not safe and reasonable. For the reasons set out below, I find that the Appellant has not met the burden of establishing that Mumbai is unsafe or unreasonable.\nThe motivation to locate the Appellant\n[22] There is insufficient evidence that the Punjab police suspect the Appellant of being a militant. This fact has not been established on a balance of probabilities. There is no warrant for his arrest, and he was released by the police twice upon the payment of a bribe. This does not suggest that he is suspected of being a dangerous militant. As the Appellant stated during the RPD hearing, the primary motivation of the police was to question him about MS's whereabouts and to obtain a bribe.6 I have accepted this as the motivation of the police in my IFA analysis.\n[23] There is insufficient evidence that the local police in the Appellant's village would be motivated to invest time and resources to locate him outside the state of Punjab to collect a bribe. There are inadequate numbers of police officers in India to serve the size of the population. Police officers are overworked and overburdened. Police stations are understaffed and under-resourced.7 In this context, it would be far easier and far more likely for a corrupt police officer to collect bribes locally rather than invest the time and resources to search for a person in another state.\nThe ability to locate the Appellant\n[24] However, even if the police in the Appellant's village are motivated to locate him, there is insufficient evidence of their ability to do so.\n[25] Generally speaking, if the agent of persecution is a state actor, then an IFA is often not viable since it is more likely that a state actor has the ability to track a person throughout the country. However, state actors have different levels of influence or power. The Appellant has not presented sufficient evidence that the local police in his village have influence or power outside of their state. The police interest in him is localized to his village.\n[26] Furthermore, the United Kingdom Home Office report on internal relocation in India equates rogue or corrupt state actors with non-state actors. The report states that generally, a person fearing non-state actors, and even state actors, is likely to be able to relocate to another area of India.8 In this case, the local police can be characterized as rogue or corrupt if their interest in the Appellant is based on their desire to collect a bribe.\n[27] There are 29 states and 7 union territories in India. State governments are responsible for law and order and the police.9 There is little inter-state sharing of information, except for major or high-profile crimes. There is no effective national database to track individuals. Each state operates individually.10\n[28] The NDP reports that India does not have a national, general registration system to enable the police to track the location of citizens in their own state, let alone in other states. Police systems operate as \"islands of technology\" and only communicate within their own state or district. For example, a police officer issuing a traffic ticket would be unable to search for a person's traffic violation history in any other states.11\n[29] This description of the lack of a reliable means of state-to-state communication between the police suggests that the local police in the Appellant's village would not have the ability to track him in another state. There is insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellant's information or location would be shared with authorities in another state.\n[30] While there are reports of inter-state sharing of information between police stations in cases of high-profile crimes such as terrorism,12 there is insufficient evidence that the Appellant, with his lack of any criminal record or charges against him, would be the subject of a national manhunt involving multiple states. There is also insufficient evidence that the Appellant is suspected of being a terrorist. He was not formally charged with any crime, there is no warrant for his arrest, and he was released twice by the police after the payment of a bribe.\n[31] The Appellant argues that the fact that the police came to look for him while he was in hiding in Chandigarh establishes that there is inter-state sharing of information between the police. I disagree. The police were aware that the Appellant was in Chandigarh because the Appellant's father told them where he was.\n[32] The Appellant believes that the existence of certain databases or systems will make it easy for the police to find him in the IFA locations. Since the Appellant would need to show identification when he rents an apartment or applies for a job, and a background check may be done, he fears that this will alert the police in his hometown to his new location.\n[33] There has been progress creating a national crime database in India, known as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), that can assist the police in doing criminal background checks. However, as discussed below, it is very unlikely that there is any information about the Appellant in that database to assist the police in locating him.\nInformation about the Appellant would not be contained in the CCTNS\n[34] The CCTNS is a national database containing information about crime and criminals.13 The CCTNS contains information from First Information Reports (FIR), which is a report of a crime that is filed at a police station, as well as data from prisons and courts.14 The Appellant is not a criminal; he has no official arrests or charges against him. There is no evidence of any official paperwork being issued concerning the Appellant, such as a FIR or an arrest warrant.\n[35] While there could be information contained in the CCTNS from sources other than a FIR or an arrest warrant, such as the police station's daily diary or log, this is insufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that there is information about the Appellant in the CCTNS which could alert the police in his hometown to his new location.\n[36] The Appellant was not charged with a crime, and no paperwork such as a FIR or an arrest warrant was issued by the police. The Appellant stated that he was never arrested lawfully; he was tortured while he was detained and released upon the payment of a bribe. His interaction with the police is more reasonably characterised as an extrajudicial detention, than an official or sanctioned arrest. The NDP reports that no records of any extrajudicial arrests are maintained in any official criminal databases, including the CCTNS.15 Based on the objective evidence in the NDP, on a balance of probabilities, information about the Appellant would not be contained in the CCTNS. It is logical and understandable that corrupt police officers who unlawfully detain a person, torture them, and accept a bribe to release them, would not keep official records of that process.\n[37] The Federal Court has recently determined that it was reasonable for the RAD to find that information about a claimant would not be contained in the CCTNS if a claimant was not lawfully detained and no FIR was issued.16\n[38] As a result of the above finding, any background check that may be conducted on the Appellant for the purpose of securing housing or employment is unlikely to alert the police in his hometown to his new location. Therefore, there is no serious possibility of persecution.\nThe Aadhaar card\n[39] The Aadhaar card or number is an identification system in India, and the card is required to access many government services. The Appellant believes that the police will be able to track him through his Aadhaar card. However, the NDP reports that there is no access to Aadhaar card information in any police database system, including the CCTNS, due to legal constraints and privacy laws.17\n[40] The Appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that his Aadhaar card could be used to locate him in the IFA location.\nThe tenant verification system\n[41] The Appellant argues that the tenant verification system can be used to track him in the IFA location since the verification process is mandatory in India. Landlords can be prosecuted for failing to verify their tenants.\n[42] The tenant verification system is a free service provided by police stations which, in theory, is meant to provide some reassurance that a property is not being rented out to a criminal or a terrorist. Landlords are expected to provide the police station in the area with details about their tenants so that this information can be checked against criminal databases, such as the CCTNS.18\n[43] Although the tenant verification system is supposed to be mandatory, due to the size of India's population of over one billion, the system is difficult to implement. It is reported that it is impossible for the police to verify all tenants since the police lack the resources to do so many verification checks. A police station can receive over 50 verification forms a day.19 The Mumbai Police Commissioner stated that, given the lack of resources, the extent of the verification process is to ensure ID documents are not fake by asking to see multiple ID documents.20 In most police stations, tenant verification forms were found dumped and gathering dust, with no action taken.21\n[44] Also, although tenant verification is mandatory, landlords themselves do not always comply with the requirement to provide information about their tenants to the police.22\n[45] The CCTNS is used in the tenant verification process. Therefore, even if a criminal background check was conducted on the Appellant when he rents an apartment, as already discussed above, it is unlikely that there is any information about the Appellant in the CCTNS to alert the authorities that he is a person of interest in his hometown.\n[46] There is insufficient objective evidence that the tenant verification system could be used to alert the local police in the Appellant's village about his whereabouts.\nThe risk to the Appellant as a Sikh\n[47] The Appellant is a Sikh, and he argues that the RPD underestimated the problems faced by Sikhs, since Sikhs are discriminated against outside of the state of Punjab. The Appellant has quoted from a portion of a document in the NDP23 regarding the treatment of religious minorities by Hindu nationalists but he provided no detail as to how this relates to his personal circumstances.\n[48] The Federal Court has consistently found that country condition evidence alone is insufficient to support a claim. It is not sufficient to rely on country condition evidence without linking this information to an appellant's personal circumstances.24\n[49] An appellant can not rely only on general country conditions to establish that an IFA is unreasonable. They must also provide sufficient evidence to show that their specific situation and circumstances will make relocation to the IFA location unreasonable.25 The Appellant has not provided sufficient evidence.\n[50] During the 1980s, there were issues with community violence directed toward Sikhs during the Sikh separatist movement. Since the mid-1990s, support for the Sikh separatist or pro-Khalistan movement lessened, and the majority of Sikhs do not experience societal discrimination or violence.26\n[51] Most Sikhs live in the state of Punjab. Outside of Punjab state, Sikhs are generally safe and integrated into society. However, there are incidents of localized discrimination, particularly concerning articles of faith, such as the turban or kirpan, in areas that are unfamiliar with Sikh practices.27 However, a photograph of the Appellant in his passport establishes that he does not follow traditional Sikh practices concerning articles of faith. He has XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. There is a sizeable Sikh community in every major city in India.28 Therefore, the Appellant would not be isolated, unusual, or one of only a few Sikhs in Mumbai. There is insufficient evidence that this major city would be unfamiliar with Sikh practices, which could have made the Appellant a target.\n[52] There has been a rise in Hindu nationalism in India since the current national Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government came to power in 2014, which has led to increased reports of intolerance and violence against non-Hindus and other minorities by Hindu fundamentalists. The majority of the reports of intolerance and violence concern Muslims, although Sikhs have sometimes been targeted.29 Sikhs who publicly support the creation of the independent Sikh state of Khalistan have an increased risk of harassment or violence from Hindu fundamentalists.30 The Appellant did not provide evidence that he is, or would be, a public supporter of the pro-Khalistan movement.\n[53] Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Appellant in his appeal memorandum, the incidents of violence against religious minorities have mostly occurred in states that are ruled by the BJP. The BJP are not the ruling party in the state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located.31\nThe first part of the IFA test has been met\n[54] The Appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that the local police in his village have the motivation and\/or means to locate him in Mumbai.\n[55] The first part of the IFA test has been met. The IFA location is safe since there is no serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture.\nPart two of the IFA test: the reasonableness of the IFA location\nThe location of the IFA is not a barrier to relocating\n[56] Internal migration is common in India. Freedom of internal movement is protected by the Constitution of India, which gives citizens the right to relocate, reside and settle in any part of the country. There are no legal barriers to relocating.32\n[57] Mumbai is a state capital and a major urban centre with a population of about 21 million.33 No evidence of hardship due to an inability to travel to the IFA location was presented. Mumbai is a major urban centre serviced by major roads and transportation services. It is safely and reasonably accessible.\nLanguage and religion are not barriers to relocating\n[58] The Appellant speaks and understands Punjabi, as well as some English. Numerous languages are spoken in Mumbai, including English.34 The Appellant is not arguing that he will face unreasonable language barriers in Mumbai.\n[59] The Appellant identifies as a Sikh. He is not arguing that he could not practice his religion in the IFA location. As already mentioned above, there is a sizeable Sikh community in every major city in India.35 There is insufficient evidence that the Appellant would be unable to practice his religion freely within a Sikh community and gurdwara in the IFA location.\n[60] There is insufficient evidence of language or religious barriers that would amount to undue hardship in the IFA location or place the Appellant's life or safety in jeopardy, which is the required threshold to establish unreasonableness.\nHousing and employment considerations\n[61] The Appellant is concerned about renting an apartment in the IFA location due to the tenant verification system. This issue has already been addressed under part one of the IFA test.\n[62] During the RPD hearing, the Appellant argued that he will have difficulty finding a job in Mumbai because he will be an outsider as a Sikh, and he will be discriminated against. Other than this general statement, the Appellant did not provide evidence to establish that Sikhs face difficulty obtaining employment in Mumbai. As already noted above, the NDP reports that the majority of Sikhs do not experience societal discrimination or violence.36\n[63] The average number of years of formal education for men in India is eleven years.37 The Appellant is twenty-six years old, and he has XXXX years of formal education, which is slightly above the average years of education for men in India. He worked on his family's XXXX in India. He also gained work experience in Canada as a XXXX XXXX and a XXXX XXXX.\n[64] The Appellant is not highly educated or skilled. However, a significant portion of India's workforce is employed in the unskilled labour force. Over 30 percent of the workforce is employed in the service field and over 20 percent work in industry. Over 40 percent work in agriculture.38 More than 70 percent of India's workforce are self-employed or casual workers.39 There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the Appellant would not be reasonably employable in the service or industry workforce settings in the IFA location, which is a major city.\n[65] The results of India's census establish that there are Sikhs in every Indian state and that every major city in India has a Sikh community. Sikhs often seek help to access housing and other services from local gurdwaras.40 Mumbai is a large city, and the Appellant has not presented any evidence to establish that there is no Sikh community or gurdwara in Mumbai where he can seek help finding employment leads or housing. I recognize that the Appellant will face some challenges in finding employment and housing in a new city. However, he was resourceful and able to overcome these same challenges when he came to Canada.\n[66] The Appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that he would face unreasonable employment or housing barriers that would amount to undue hardship or place his life or safety in jeopardy, which is the required threshold to establish unreasonableness.\nOther factors considered\n[67] There is a high threshold that must be met to show that an IFA is unreasonable. The Appellant has not met the high threshold to establish that the IFA location is unreasonable.\n[68] The fact that the Appellant might be physically and economically better off in Canada than in a safe place in his own country is not a factor to be considered when assessing the reasonableness of an IFA.41\n[69] The Appellant's preferences about where to live are not relevant. Neither is an inconvenience or a reduction in status or quality of life. Hardship associated with relocating or being separated from family members is not sufficient to establish unreasonableness.42\nThe second part of the IFA test has been met\n[70] The second part of the IFA test has been met. The Appellant has not established that living in the IFA location will be unreasonable to the extent that it would be unduly harsh to live there or that his life or safety will be in jeopardy.\nCONCLUSION\n[71] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nKaren Wallace\nKaren Wallace\nJanuary 9, 2023\nDate\n1 Subsection 110(3), Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He alleges as follows in his Basis of Claim (BOC) Form.\n[2] The Appellant says he fell in love with a local, SP, in XXXX 2017, before he relocated to Canada on a student visa in XXXX 2017. He returned to India for a visit in XXXX 2018. He says on XXXX XXXX, 2018, SP's father, MD, found the Appellant with SP and beat him. The Appellant escaped and went to stay with a friend in Jalandhar. The Appellant says MD returned that evening to the Appellant's home with four thugs and beat his parents. He says the local police came the next day and threatened to frame the Appellant. He travelled back to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018 and claimed refugee protection in August 2019.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) raised credibility concerns but ultimately rejected the claim based on an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Jaipur, Rajasthan. The Appellant appeals to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). He does not present new evidence.\nDECISION\n[4] I dismiss the appeal pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The determinative issue is IFA.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The Appellant submits the RPD erred by finding he has a viable IFA and by impugning his credibility.1 My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2\n[6] For the following reasons, I find the Appellant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life, or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or danger of torture in the IFA.\nRAD does not draw negative credibility inference over injuries\n[7] The RPD indicated that it had credibility concerns with the Appellant's allegations, but that it would not elaborate on all of them as the determinative issue was an IFA in Jaipur. The RPD did discuss one credibility concern however, which is that the Appellant stated at the hearing that he sustained injuries on his face, back and lips on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, but did not mention these injuries in his narrative.3 The RPD rejected the Appellant's explanation that mentioning his injuries did not come to his mind at the time he wrote the narrative, and concluded that the Appellant was embellishing his testimony at the hearing. The Appellant submits the failure to mention his injuries in the BOC was merely an inconsequential and unintentional omission.4\n[8] The RAD will accept that the Appellant's testimony regarding his injuries were additional details.\nAppellant has a safe and reasonable IFA in Jaipur\n[9] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged. First, I must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of an appellant being persecuted in the part of the country where an IFA exists or that the appellant would not be personally subjected to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA. Secondly, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to an appellant to seek refuge there. Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the appellant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFA(s) have been identified, the burden of proof rests on the appellant to show that they do not have an IFA.\n[10] For the following reasons, I find the Appellant has a safe and reasonable IFA in Jaipur.\nFirst prong: Motivation\n[11] The RPD noted the Appellant's belief that MD would still be interested in him a number of years after the incidents in question because of his honour, and accepted that MD may have some motivation to locate the Appellant.5 The RPD concluded however, that the Appellant did not establish that the local police have the motivation to locate him outside their jurisdiction given that there is no First Information Report (FIR), charges, summons or warrant against him, he is not wanted by a court, and a long period of time has elapsed without any contact between the Appellant and SP.6\n[12] The Appellant submits that he \"wishes to reinforce the following objective evidence and submissions\" with respect to \"the 'motivation' factor as it pertains to the issue of IFA.\"7\n[13] Based on my assessment, I will accept that MD may have some motivation to locate the Appellant to the IFA and that he could potentially bribe the local police to make such efforts. However, for the following reasons, I find the Appellant has not established that MD, the local police, or his Congress goons, have the means to locate him to the IFA, and that this is determinative of the first prong.\nFirst prong: Means\nAppellant has not established that he could be located to the IFA by the local police\n[14] The RPD accepted that the Appellant's hometown police and MD could have influence in their own area of jurisdiction or even in the neighbouring areas, and that the local police could act illegally to please MD.8 The RPD concluded, however, that the Appellant did not establish that the police, MD or the Congress goons have the means to locate him to the IFA.9 Specifically, the RPD noted that the Appellant was not arrested, detained, or charged and is not wanted by police or a Court of law. Accordingly, the RPD found it was not established that the police could have made a record of the Appellant and therefore, by extension, it was not established that the Appellant could be in the Crime and Criminal Tracking and Network System (CCTNS). The RPD concluded that, as the Appellant did not establish he could be in the CCTNS, it follows that he could not be located through tenant or job verification. The RPD further noted that the ability of police in India to track persons is limited and the efficacy of the tenant verification system is dubious.10 The RPD considered the Appellant's argument that he could be located as a result of using his Aadhaar card in the course of background checks for employment, housing and banking.11 The RPD noted, however, the country condition information indicates that the Aadhaar is not used for tracking.12\n[15] The Appellant submits that items 1.5 and 10.10 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) confirms that the \"police are influenced by political or other extraneous considerations.\"13 Also,14 item 1.10 of the NDP conveys that the ruling party in the IFA is the Congress and the RPD accepted that MD has, to some degree, influence over the Congress. Therefore, the agents of persecution would have the \"political and operational reach and means to pursue him\" in Jaipur.\n[16] Based on my review, I accept that the police in India can suffer from corruption and can be influenced by political or other extraneous considerations, such as bribes. However, having conducted my own assessment, I agree with and adopt the RPD's reasons. I find the Appellant has not established that his local police have the means to track him to the IFA.\n[17] First, I agree with the RPD that the lack of any official police interest or documentation renders it highly unlikely that the Appellant could be in any official crime or police database which could put him at risk in the IFA. As the RPD noted, the Appellant was never arrested, detained or summoned, and there is no evidence of any charges, warrants or court interest in him. Therefore, I do not find the Appellant has established he is a person of interest to his local police. I acknowledge information in the NDP that the police's general or daily diary is entered in the CCTNS15 and that the Appellant says the police continue to visit his home and neighbours. However, I find the suggestion that the police could have recorded the Appellant's information into the CCTNS is very speculative in the context of the police not issuing any formal process against him and not having any genuine concerns that he is involved in any criminality. Rather, according to the Appellant's evidence, the police harassment is simply because the officers are corrupt and acting under MD's influence. I find the lack of evidence that the police are interested in the Appellant for genuine concerns of criminality further undermines that they could have made a record of the Appellant in the CCTNS, particularly in light of information in the NDP that extrajudicial arrests are not recorded in the CCTNS.16\n[18] According to 2021 information in the NDP, if the Appellant was to undergo tenant verification in the IFA, this would occur through the CCTNS.17 As he has not established that he could be in the CCTNS, I find it has not been established that he could be tracked through tenant verification in the IFA. Similarly, access to information for the purposes of employment also occurs through the CCTNS.18 As there is a lack of evidence to establish the Appellant is in the CCTNS, it follows that background employment checks would also not raise any alerts. As the Appellant's appeal record was filed after the latest NDP of June 30, 2022, he is presumed to have notice of it.19\n[19] However, even if the Appellant was a person of interest, according to the NDP,20 information about persons of interest is not recorded in the CCTNS but in classified databases that are not shared across states. While the NDP does state that concerned officers can seek information through \"normal official channels\" I do not find the Appellant has established that there is any reason for police in the IFA to seek information on him through any method other than by using the CCTNS.\n[20] I also acknowledge a reference in the NDP to tenant verification occurring through information sheets being sent directly to a tenant's local police force, however this information is from 2019 and predates the 2021 information that tenant verification takes place through the CCTNS.21 In any event, even where it is mandatory for landlords to register their tenants, it is ultimately up to the local police stations to do the actual verification. However, the NDP evidence suggests that police compliance is lacking.22\n[21] Regarding the Appellant's submissions concerning the Congress Party, even if they are in power in Rajasthan, I find he has not led sufficient evidence to establish what MD's limited local connections to the Congress Party are, if and how these connections are related to the Congress Party's national apparatus, what that national apparatus even is, and how such a mechanism, if any, could be used to trace the Appellant to the IFA. In any event, on a state-level, Congress is not in power in Punjab and, on a national level, only holds 52 out of 545 seats in parliament.23 Notably, Congress has been losing influence for some time.24 Finally, while MD allegedly uses Congress goons to do his bidding, this does not establish that the Congress Party in general has any interest in the Appellant. Therefore, I find the country condition evidence does not support the Appellant's submission, to the extent he is proffering it, that he could be traced to the IFA through the Congress Party.\nAppellant has not established he could be tracked as a failed asylum seeker\n[22] The RPD also found the country condition evidence did not evince that the Appellant would face any issues upon return to India as a refused asylum seeker given that he possesses a valid passport, does not fall into a category of suspicious or high-profile persons, and there is no evidence that there is a Look Out Circular that applies to him.25\n[23] The Appellant does not contest this finding.\n[24] Having conducted my independent assessment, I agree with and adopt the RPD's findings in this regard.\nAppellant has not established he could be tracked through connections with family and friends\n[25] Finally, the RPD noted the Appellant's belief that MD, the Congress goons and police could pressure his family to disclose his IFA location.26 The RPD found however that it would be reasonable for the Appellant to not disclose his whereabouts to persons other than his family.27 The RPD further concluded that even if the Appellant's local police became aware of his whereabouts through family or otherwise, there is insufficient evidence to establish that the police would harm or persecute him to the IFA, given the lack of official interest in him.28\n[26] The Appellant submits the RPD erred by finding, despite visits and inquiries by the agents of harm to his family, that he could live in an IFA.29 The Appellant points to caselaw that if a claimant's family has been directly approached about the claimant's whereabouts, they cannot be said to have a reasonable IFA. He says he would be forced to conceal his whereabouts from his family, as the agents of harm will continue to visit and pressure them about his whereabouts until they disclose his location and his family cannot be expected to put their own lives at risk.\n[27] Based on my assessment, I find the RPD erred by suggesting that even if the police knew of the Appellant's location in the IFA, he would not be at risk. This finding disregards the possibility that the police need not do anything more than simply relay the Appellant's location to MD who could then persecute the Appellant personally.\n[28] Nevertheless, I do not find the Appellant has established he could be unsafe in the IFA as a result of his connection to family and friends.\n[29] According to his father's affidavit, which was recently written in XXXX 2022, the Appellant's parents refused to disclose his location to the agents of harm or the police.30 The Appellant also he wrote in his narrative of XXXX 2019 that his parents did not tell anyone of his whereabouts.31 Finally, aside from the initial incident on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, there is no evidence that his parents have been harmed despite being allegedly being continuously asked about the Appellant's whereabouts over a number of years. Rather, his parents have continued to live in their customary village despite the alleged numerous visits and inquiries. In Enweliku, the Federal Court found it was speculative to suggest that a family member who has previously protected a claimant's location would assist an agent of persecution.32 While the Appellant has a friend in Jalandhar, there is no evidence that this friend has ever been approached about the Appellant's whereabouts. Furthermore, while the Appellant has a sister in Chandigarh, there is no evidence that she has ever been approached by anyone looking for the Appellant either. While the Appellant has led evidence of his neighbours being asked about his whereabouts,33 he has not suggested that his neighbours are family or friends who could or ought to be informed of his location in the IFA. Notably, one neighbour wrote that he did not even want to know where the Appellant is.34 Finally, the Appellant did not lead evidence any of other connections in his village being approached by anyone in search for him.\n[30] Overall, the evidence indicates the search for the Appellant has been localized to his small village. Based on the evidence before me, I find he has not discharged his burden of establishing he could be located in the IFA through his connections to family and friends.\nAppellant has not established he would be at risk in the IFA from the Sikh community\n[31] The RPD acknowledged counsel's submission that the Appellant, who is Hindu, would face discrimination from the Sikh community in the IFA. The RPD found this submission was speculative and noted that the 87% of the population in the IFA is Hindu.35\n[32] The Appellant does not contest this finding.\n[33] Having conducted my independent assessment, I agree with and adopt the RPD's findings in this regard.\nConclusion on first prong\n[34] Overall, based on the foregoing, I find the Appellant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or danger of torture in the IFA.\nSecond prong: IFA would not be unreasonable\n[35] With respect to analyzing the reasonableness of a proposed IFA under the second prong, the Federal Court of Appeal has held that there is:\n...[A] very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.36\n[36] The Court has reiterated the importance of not lowering that threshold.\n[37] In Thirunavukkarasu, the Court said:\n...[N]either is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there. If it is objectively reasonable in these latter cases to live in these places, without fear of persecution, then IFA exists and the claimant is not a refugee.37\n[38] The RPD found that any challenges associated with relocation to the IFA would not rise to the level of undue hardship.38 The RPD noted that the Appellant has some knowledge of English and Hindi which are spoken in the IFA, XXXX XXXX XXXX years of education and work experience and education from Canada. Also, there is transportation, educational institutions, and places of worship in the IFA. Regarding the findings on an MRI, the RPD found the Appellant did not establish that he would be unable to obtain treatment for this in the IFA. The RPD accepted that the Appellant may experience some challenges in relocating but concluded that these did not rise to the level of undue hardship.\n[39] The Appellant does not contest the RPD's findings regarding the second prong.\n[40] Having conducted my independent assessment, I agree with and adopt the RPD's findings in this regard. I find the Appellant has not established that any challenges he may face in relocating to the IFA would, in all the circumstances, rise to the level of undue hardship.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] Overall, I find the Appellant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment or danger of torture in the IFA. I also find the Appellant has not established that any challenges he may face in relocating to the IFA would rise, in all the circumstances, to the high level of undue hardship. The Appellant has a safe and reasonable IFA in Jaipur.\n[42] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\nK.

The Appellants are appealing a Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision that denied their claims for refugee protection.\n[2] The Appellants fear for their lives at the hands of the police and drug goons in India. They allege they have been falsely accused of being linked to drug dealers. The Principal Appellant was detained and beaten by the police, and the drug goons threatened to kidnap and gang rape the Associate Appellant.\n[3] The RPD concluded that the Appellants are not entitled to refugee protection because they have an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) - a location that is safe and reasonable for them to relocate to - in Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore, India.\n[4] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in finding that they would be safe in the proposed IFAs. They argue that the RPD did not respect the objective documentation on the lack of state protection and the international test for a viable IFA. They submit that it is an error to find that an IFA exists for the Appellants who are fleeing corrupt police officers and authorities who are still looking for them.\n[5] The Appellants have submitted reports from a psychologist and a physician, and statements from individuals in India that they want me to admit as new evidence for this appeal. They have also requested that I convene an oral hearing.\n[6] I admit some of the information tendered as new evidence, and decline to admit other parts of the information submitted by the Appellants. I deny the Appellants' request for an oral hearing.\n[7] It is my decision that the RPD correctly decided the Appellants' claims. The Appellants are not entitled to refugee protection because they have an IFA in in Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore, India.\nDECISION\n[8] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention1 refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[9] The following paragraphs are a summary of the Appellants' allegations as set out in their narrative to their Basis of Claim form.2 This summary does not necessarily represent my findings of fact.\n[10] The Appellants resided in Haryana, India, where they farmed and resided with their son and the Principal Appellant's mother.\n[11] The Appellants allege that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, they were in their fields. The Associate Appellant was controlling the pump, and the Principal Appellant was irrigating the crops. They allege that three men came towards the pump house and requested that the Associate Appellant let them in. The Associate Appellant had no time to respond before the men entered the open door to the pump house.\n[12] The Principal Appellant came running to the Associate Appellant when he saw three men approaching her. The Principal Appellant alleges he saw the men sitting in the pump house, and that the men begged the Appellants to close the door.\n[13] The Appellants allege that within seconds, they heard police sirens and they then understood these men were some kind of outlaws. The Principal Appellant closed the door from the outside.\n[14] The Appellants allege that the policemen came directly to the Appellants and asked them if they saw someone running. The Appellants allege they pointed toward the pump house, and the policemen then opened the door and caught the three men.\n[15] The Appellants allege that each men had a small bag. The Appellants allege that the police brought the men out, and the men were staring at the Appellants with a killer look when suddenly one of the men pushed the policemen and ran towards the local highway.\n[16] The Appellants allege that the Principal Appellant tried to stop the suspect, but the suspect hit the Principal Appellant with a blunt object under the chin. The Appellants allege that the policemen took control of the two suspects, and did not follow the third one.\n[17] The Appellants allege that the policemen thanked them, and took the suspects to the police station.\n[18] The Appellants allege that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, a police constable came to their house and informed them that the inspector wanted them at the police station. The Principal Appellant went with the constable. The Principal Appellant alleges that the inspector was in the interrogation room, and he told the Principal Appellant to sit in a chair in the middle of the room.\n[19] The Principal Appellant alleges that the inspector informed him that one of the suspects had given a statement indicating that the Principal Appellant hid drugs and drug peddlers at his pump house, and that the Principal Appellant had the suspects arrested because of a dispute involving money. The Principal Appellant alleges that he told the inspector that he had helped catch the suspects, so he questioned how the police could believe the suspects. The Principal Appellant alleges that the inspector slapped him and told him to tell the truth.\n[20] The Principal Appellant alleges that he informed the inspector that what he was doing was against the law, and he would complain to their senior officials if he did not stop. The Principal Appellant alleges that they started to beat him mercilessly and told him to confess for his involvement with the drug mafia. The Principal Appellant denied any involvement, and eventually lost consciousness.\n[21] The Principal Appellant alleges that after regaining consciousness, a constable told him to accompany him to the office, where he was told to sign blank papers and was fingerprinted and photographed. The Principal Appellant alleges that the inspector took him outside where he found his brother-in-law sitting with their village sarpanch.\n[22] The Principal Appellant alleges that he was released on XXXX XXXX, 2019, with a promise to return whenever required. The Principal Appellant alleges that his brother-in-law told him that he had paid a bribe of XXXX XXXX XXXX Indian Rupees for the Principal Appellant's release. The Principal Appellant alleges that he received medical care from a nursing home.\n[23] The Principal Appellant alleges that after a few days, the Associate Appellant was crying when she returned from the market. The Associate Appellant alleges that she came across the three suspects, who told her that they were politically connected and had not suffered any consequences after their arrest.\n[24] The Associate Appellant alleges that the men told her that they had the Principal Appellant entrapped by the police in such a way that it would be a lesson for other people. The Associate Appellant also alleges that the three men told her they had instructed the police to confront the Principal Appellant one day as they had a paper signed by him that could be used as his confession. The Associate Appellant alleges that the three men planned to kidnap and gang rape her, while videotaping it to stigmatize her to the extent she would commit suicide.\n[25] The Appellants allege that they sought help from the Principal Appellant's brother-in-law, who took them to a lawyer who advised them to relocate immediately as the police work closely with the drug mafia, and that the men must have been politically connected to avoid consequences after being arrested.\n[26] The Appellants allege that they went to XXXX XXXX, where a relative lives, and an agent was retained to obtain a visa for them. The Appellants allege that the agent obtained visas on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and gave them passports on XXXX XXXX, 2019, along with plane tickets. The Appellants allege that their son and the Principal Appellant's mother are still in India, and that they are being taken care of by the Associate Appellant's family.\n[27] The Appellants arrived in Canada on or about XXXX XXXX, 2019.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[28] The Appellants have provided the following documents in their Appellants' Record:3\n* Item 1: Affidavit of Principal Appellant sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022, with attached copy of narrative to Appellants' Basis of Claim form, and the additional documents proposed as new evidence, described below.\n* Item 2: Psychologist's Report dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Item 3: Affidavit of XXXX XXXX XXXX (Neighbor) sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Item 4: Affidavit of XXXX XXXX (Panchayat Member) sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Item 5: Affidavit of XXXX XXXX (Friend) sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Item 6: Affidavit of XXXX XXXX (Sarpanch) sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Item 7: Affidavit of XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellant's Sister) sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n* Item 8: Medical Report dated XXXX XXXX, 2022 (relating to Principal Appellant's mother); and\n* Item 9: Medical Report dated XXXX XXXX, 2022 (relating to Appellants' son).\n[29] For the following reasons, I admit portions of Item 1, and Items 2, 8 and 9. I deny the admission of the remaining documents.\n[30] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act4 (IRPA) anticipates that an appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) will ordinarily be based on the record of the RPD proceeding.\n[31] According to section 110(4) of the IRPA, I can only accept new evidence on this appeal that: arose after the RPD decision (the RPD issued its written decision on June 30, 2022); was not reasonably available at the time of the RPD decision; or, the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before its decision.\n[32] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible (e.g., the source and the circumstances in which it came into existence) and relevant before I can accept it.5\nItem 1 (Principal Appellant's affidavit)\n[33] Other than for one paragraph (paragraph 5 of the Affidavit), I am not admitting the Principal Appellant's affidavit as it does not comply with the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[34] While the affidavit was sworn after the RPD decision, it is not the date when the affidavit was sworn that is determinative, but rather the date of the information contained within the affidavit. In this case, the information contained in the Principal Appellant's affidavit did not arise after the RPD decision. The affidavit contains information that was or could have been provided at the RPD hearing. The information in the affidavit expresses disagreement with the RPD decision; repeats background information or information about the basis of the claim that was before the RPD (including attaching the narrative to the Appellants' Basis of Claim form, which was in evidence at the RPD hearing, and is therefore not new evidence), or that could have been presented to the RPD before its decision. For example, the Principal Appellant indicates that the agents of harm came to his house and abused his mother and son in XXXX 2022. There is no explanation for why the Appellants could not have communicated this fact to the RPD before it issued its written decision on June 30, 2022. A further example is in the Principal Appellant's statement that there is a great deal of documentation about the system of corruption with the police in India, and his allegation that he cannot get any kind of protection from the police or judicial system.6 The National Documentation Package (NDP) for India, which contains numerous documents on the country conditions, was before the RPD and available for the Appellants to refer to at the RPD hearing.\n[35] There are three pieces of information I admit from the Principal Appellant's affidavit, as follows:\na. Paragraph 5 of the affidavit addresses the RPD's comments made in its decision about confusion regarding the location of the police station.7 The RPD made the comments about the name of the police station, and attempted to clarify its confusion while noting that the RPD member had not put any questions to the Appellants about the RPD's confusion at the hearing. Paragraph 5 of the Principal Appellant's affidavit provides information about the RPD's confusion regarding the police station. This information could not have been provided at the RPD hearing as the RPD did not advise the Appellants of its confusion, and did not provide an opportunity for the Appellants to address its confusion at the RPD hearing.\nb. The second piece of information I am admitting is the Principal Appellant's allegation that the police are still looking for him and his family, as described in paragraph 11 and 13 of his affidavit. The Principal Appellant explains that in XXXX and XXXX, police officers went to his village, asked about his whereabouts, and attacked his son, who he alleges is in great danger. The alleged visit in XXXX occurred after the RPD decision was issued.\nc. The third piece of information I am admitting is the Principal Appellant's statement that he and his wife suffer from mental health problems related to depression and anxiety, which he indicates has worsened after the RPD issued its decision denying their claims.\nItems 2, 8 and 9 (Psychologist's report and medical reports)\n[36] I am admitting the psychologist's report because it is based on interviews that occurred after the RPD decision was issued, and therefore the report could not have been presented to the RPD before its decision. The psychologist's report contains information that is new, credible in terms of its source and circumstances, being from a psychologist who interviewed the Appellants, and relevant to the Appellants' arguments concerning their inability to return to India based on their psychological circumstances.\n[37] I am admitting the medical reports as they appear to be related to medical visits where the Principal Appellant's mother was released from the hospital after the RPD issued its decision, and therefore the reports could not have been provided to the RPD before its decision. The reports contain information that is new, credible in terms of their source and circumstances, being from a doctor who treated the Principal Appellant's mother and son, and relevant to the Appellants' arguments that the Principal Appellant's mother and son have been attacked by people looking for the Appellants.\nItems 3 to 7 (Various affidavits)\n[38] I deny the admission of the various affidavits submitted by the Appellants. The information in these affidavits does not meet the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA and is not credible.\n[39] The information in the affidavits repeats information provided at the RPD hearing (e.g., regarding the history of the Appellants' basis of claims), or gives information about events that occurred before the RPD decision (e.g., allegations that police were looking for the Appellants leading up to the RPD decision), and there is no explanation provided for why these individuals could not have submitted an affidavit with this information before the RPD issued its decision.\n[40] To the extent there is information in the affidavits about events that occurred after the RPD decision (e.g., Item 3 indicates that the police came looking for the Appellants on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022, and Item 6 indicates that the police called the first week of XXXX, both of which occurred after the RPD decision was issued on June 30, 2022), I find this information is not credible because the timing is suspicious. A rash of allegations of police looking for the Appellants so soon after the negative RPD decision appears to be an attempt to bolster the Appellants' claims and respond to the RPD's finding that the police are not motivated to pursue the Appellants. Suspicious or fortuitous timing of events can be the basis to reject new evidence on the basis of its credibility.8\nORAL HEARING\n[41] The Appellants have requested an oral hearing.9 For the following reasons, I deny the Appellants' request for an oral hearing.\n[42] The Federal Court has commented on the requirements for holding an oral hearing:10\nThe scheme of the IRPA is that the RAD must proceed without conducting a hearing. The exception to this is where the new evidence meets the s 110(4) requirements; meets the implicit Raza criteria, which includes the credibility of the evidence (Singh at para 44 and 49); and, meets the requirements of s 110(6), being that the RAD is of the opinion there is documentary evidence that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal, is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim and, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[43] The Federal Court has indicated that, \"There is no obligation to convene an oral hearing to assess the credibility of new evidence.\"11 In other words, the Appellants are not required to be given an oral hearing to address the credibility concerns I have explained above concerning the statements from the various individuals that I have determined should not be admitted as new evidence because they are not credible.\n[44] With respect to the information I have admitted as new evidence, those documents in question do not trigger any of the conditions set out in section 110(6) of the IRPA, and therefore do not require an oral hearing. The documentary evidence admitted does not raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellants, is not central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim and, if accepted, would not justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\nANALYSIS\n[45] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.12 I find that after correctly giving notice at the RPD hearing that an IFA would be an issue, and specifically that the proposed IFA locations were Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore,13 the RPD correctly decided that the Principal Appellant and Associate Appellant have a viable IFA in those locations, and that they are therefore not entitled to refugee protection.\nIFA: General Principles\n[46] The Federal Court has explained the general principles for an IFA, and has indicated that to determine if a viable IFA exists, the RAD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that:14\na. there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted based on Convention grounds or subjected to, on a balance of probabilities, to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA area; and\nb. in all the circumstances, including circumstances particular to the claimant, conditions in the IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n[47] Both above \"prongs\" of the test must be satisfied to conclude that a refugee claimant has a viable IFA. The threshold on the second prong of the IFA test is a high one. There must be \"actual and concrete evidence\" of conditions that would jeopardize the claimant's life and safety in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. Once the potential for an IFA is raised, the claimant bears the onus of establishing it is not viable.\nFirst Prong: No risk of persecution or harm in Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore\n[48] For the following reasons, I find that there is no serious possibility of the Principal Appellant and Associate Appellant being persecuted based on Convention grounds or subjected to, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture or to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFAs of Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore.\n[49] The Appellants' claims do not fall under section 96 of the IRPA as they have failed to establish a nexus to a Convention ground. Even if there were a nexus to a Convention ground, the factor that is determinative of the Appellants' claims under both section 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA is the lack of motivation by the police and drug mafia to pursue the Appellants if they were to return to India in Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore.\n[50] The RPD found that India is a vast country covering over three million square kilometres and has a population of over 1.3 billion people. The RPD also found that the proposed IFAs are all of significant size, ranging from 12 to 31 million people, and are a significant distance away from the Appellants' hometown, ranging from XXXX to XXXX kilometres away. The RPD stated that, \"All of this provides a significant degree of anonymity for the claimants and considerably reduces the likelihood of them being traced and located in the proposed IFA cities by the local police or the police in Haryana in general, for which I found that motivation does not exist.\"15\n[51] While not determinative, the RPD correctly took note of the population and distance from the Appellants' hometown to the proposed IFAs. The Federal Court has held that \"...geography and distance are important in IFA cases but they are rarely the only consideration before a decision maker.\"16 The Court noted that, \"In each case, the decision maker must consider all relevant evidence regarding the serious possibility of harm to an applicant in the proposed IFA, including the characteristics of the particular alleged agent of persecution and its ability and motivation to take action in the IFA.\"17\n[52] In this case, the population and distance of the proposed IFAs are not the only factor that makes the IFA viable. Of more importance, is the factor that there is a lack of evidence that the agents of harm have the motivation to pursue the Appellants if they were to return to the proposed IFAs.\n[53] I find that the RPD correctly reasoned that the drug mafia that the Appellants fear consists of the three unidentified individuals that entered the Appellants' pumphouse.18 The RPD correctly reasoned that there is a lack of evidence to support that they are part of any larger organization, let alone evidence to determine the identity of any such organization.\n[54] The RPD correctly reasoned that there is a lack of evidence that the three unidentified individuals have any motivation to pursue the Appellants on a forward-looking basis.19 The RPD correctly found, and I agree, that the Appellants pose no threat to the three individuals, have no means to cause any trouble to the three individuals, and that the Appellants do not owe the three individuals any money.\n[55] The RPD also correctly found that there was no evidence that the three individuals had made any efforts to contact the Appellants or their family, since they made the threat to the Associate Appellant in the market in XXXX 2019. The RPD correctly concluded, and I agree, that given the time elapsed and the absence of contact with the three individuals, that these agents of harm would not be motivated to pursue the claimants if they were to relocate to the IFA locations.\n[56] With respect to the Haryana police as the other agent of harm, I find that there is a lack of motivation by the Haryana police to pursue the Appellants to the proposed IFAs. I find that the Haryana police likely viewed the Principal Appellant as someone that they had successfully extorted in the past, and beyond attempting to extort them again if they were to return to the same location, the Haryana police would have no reason to pursue the Appellants to the proposed IFAs to attempt to extort them again, versus simply choosing to extort a different victim who is local.\n[57] The Appellants argue that the underlying basis for their fear does not appear to have been addressed, which is the continuing police raids to find him in India and the terror his family is experiencing. The Appellants submit that the police are still looking for him by asking relatives and neighbours about his whereabouts.\n[58] I admitted as new evidence for this appeal, the Principal Appellant's allegation that the police are still looking for him and his family, as described in paragraph 11 and 13 of his affidavit submitted in this appeal. The Principal Appellant explains that in XXXX and XXXX, police officers went to his village, asked about his whereabouts, and attacked his son, who he alleges is in great danger. I also admitted medical reports showing that the Appellants' son and the Principal Appellant's mother received treatment.\n[59] I denied the various affidavits from witnesses that were submitted as proposed new evidence for this appeal. However, even if I had accepted that evidence, it would not have made a difference to the outcome of this appeal for the reasons that follows.\n[60] This evidence concerning the police asking about and threatening the Appellants' son and the Principal Appellant's mother (and if I had admitted it, evidence about the police asking the witnesses about the Appellants' whereabouts) show that the police continue to ask people about the whereabouts of the Appellants, but that only establishes that the local Haryana police are motivated to ask individuals in the same vicinity about the whereabouts of the Appellants.\n[61] The evidence does not establish that the local Haryana police would therefore be motivated to pursue the Appellants a great distance away in Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore. As I explained, the Appellants were a successful local target for the local Haryana police. The local police successfully obtained a bribe for the Principal Appellant's release after they had detained him. That fact does not mean that the local police would pursue the Appellants to the proposed IFAs in order to attempt to obtain more bribes from them, as opposed to simply moving on to a different local victim.\n[62] The Appellants allege that the police want to pursue the Appellants to show that they are tough on drug crime. However, this is speculation on the Appellants' part, and does not seem consistent with the fact the Haryana police released the Principal Appellant, or failed to arrest him or bring charges against him when they had him detained.\n[63] The Appellants allege that there has been no importance given to the fact that the Principal Appellant was a victim of serious human rights violations, such as arbitrary detention and torture. The Appellants allege that the current situation of massive, systematic and flagrant human rights abuses in India was not even mentioned by the RPD. The Appellants argue that there is an absolute prohibition in internal law with respect to returning the Appellants to a substantial risk of torture. They refer to Article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. They also refer to the Chahal decision of the European Court of Human Rights; the Nirmal Singh decision of the United Nations Committee against Torture; and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I will not address these arguments as the Federal Court has held that these arguments are premature at this stage.20\n[64] The Appellants argue that the RPD failed to apply Chairperson's Guideline 4 - Women Refugee Claimant's Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.21 I am not persuaded by the Appellants' submissions. The Appellants do not specify how the RPD failed to apply the Guideline. The Federal Court has held that the Guideline is used to ensure that gender-based claims are heard with sensitivity, and it is not meant to cure deficiencies in evidence.22 The Appellants have not established that the RPD did not hear their claims with sensitivity.\n[65] I admitted paragraph 5 of the Principal Appellant's affidavit addressing the RPD's comments about its confusion regarding the location of the police station.23 The Appellants' counsel also addressed the issue in the Memorandum of Argument.24 The RPD indicated in its decision that after looking on the internet after the hearing in order to clarify the name of the police station that was discussed at the hearing, the RPD found what it thought was a discrepancy resulting in what the RPD assessed as a significant distance between the Appellants' village and the police station they attended.\n[66] The RPD member noted that, \"I discovered this unusual fact only after the hearing and am unable to question the claimants about it.\"25 In paragraph 5 of his affidavit, which I admitted as new evidence for this appeal, the Principal Appellant provided further information to explain the RPD's misunderstanding. I find that this issue of the RPD's misunderstanding, and its attempt to clarify the information in its decision, had no bearing on the outcome of its decision. The RPD's comments were unnecessary to its decision as the RPD specifically noted, \"Thus, this fact is only noted in my reasons for accuracy of the facts at hand, without drawing any conclusions about the credibility of the claimants for this discrepancy.\"26 It is therefore unnecessary to address the RPD's misunderstanding any further as it was not a basis of a negative credibility finding, and had no impact on the RPD decision, and it has no impact on my reasoning.\n[67] The Appellants argue that for someone who is successfully hiding from police abuses and who has been detained, beaten and tortured at the hands of the police, it is not realistic to expect him to go and live in another part of India. The Appellants argue that it is true that the Indian Constitution permits freedom of movement, but this is no protection for someone who is being sought for connections with militants and anti-nationals. They argue that the information in the NDP indicates that one cannot rent an apartment or get a job elsewhere in India without the local police being informed and having the possibility to check their identity and background. The Appellants submit that they would be found elsewhere, and would be returned to great danger in India where the Principal Appellant has already suffered arbitrary detention, custodial violence, and torture at the hands of authorities.\n[68] The Appellants also submit that the NDP shows the extreme difficulty of living a normal life in India if the police or political authorities have any kind of interest. They argue that if one uses a bank card or cellular phone, the authorities will find them. They submit that no one in India believes that one can get away from the police or corrupt authorities if they are really targeted.\n[69] The Appellants argue that those targeted by the police, especially when corrupt police officers falsely accuse someone of being anti-nationals, are in real danger all over the country. They submit that it is completely wrong to consider that this kind of situation can be limited to a village or a state.\n[70] The Appellants argue that they have been falsely accused of being linked with militants, drug dealers, illegal activities, and anti-nationals, and that the Appellants' situation is a clear example of a case where police in different states in India would communicate to find a suspect.\n[71] I disagree with the Appellants' submissions.\n[72] The Appellants have alleged that they have been accused of crimes that rise to the level of being anti-nationals, militants or terrorists. The Appellants have not provided evidence that they have been charged with any crime, let alone of crimes of any significance that would draw any sort of national interest in them in the proposed IFAs.\n[73] I find that the Appellants are attempting to elevate their profile in order to allege a level of risk of persecution or harm that is not supported by the evidence. There is a lack of evidence that the Appellants are considered militants, anti-nationals or terrorists. The Haryana police made a bogus allegation that resulted in them detaining the Principal Appellant and receiving a bribe for his release. They have pursued the Appellants local family because the Principal Appellant has been a successful source in the past to obtain a bribe. This does not mean that the Haryana police will pursue the Appellants to the proposed IFAs when the Haryana police could instead expend their energy and resources on a different local victim.\n[74] I acknowledge that the Principal Appellant indicated that the Haryana police made him sign a blank paper, and give his fingerprints and photograph upon his release from detention. However, there is a lack of evidence that this information was used by the Haryana police to charge or file a report against the Appellants for any crimes of significance or of interest to the Haryana police or any other police force.\n[75] The Appellants allege that they would be found in the IFAs by way of various databases that would be shared between the Haryana police and the police in the IFAs. For example, the Appellants refer to tenant verification, which the Appellants submit means that one cannot rent an apartment or get a job elsewhere in India without the local police being informed and having the ability to check one's identity and background.27 The Appellants also refer to being found if they were to use a bank card or a cell phone.\n[76] I disagree with the Appellant's submissions. If there is no motivation for the Haryana police to locate the Appellants in the proposed IFAs, which there is not in this case as there is no evidence that they have a profile sufficient to warrant being pursued, then the capacity of the Haryana police to locate the Appellants is not relevant.28 The evidence supports that the Appellants are unlikely to be found in the proposed IFAs by way of the methods referred to by the Appellants.\n[77] In a Response to Information Request dated June 7, 2002, in the NDP for India dated June 30, 2022 (the NDP in place at the time the Appellants' Record was filed),29 it states that, \"there is little inter-state police communication except for cases of major crimes like smuggling, terrorism and some high profile organised crime.\"30 The report also indicates that information about persons of interest is not recorded into the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems, but in classified databases, and that police surveillance databases are classified and not shared across states, with concerned officers seeking information through normal official channels.31 One professor was reported in the document as opining, in part:32\n[i]f they put their minds to it, police authorities in India are able to track and locate persons of interest, depending on the heinousness of the crime and the pressure received from political authorities. For example, it is possible [for them] to locate a person of interest in cases of rape, murder or armed robbery.\n[78] As indicated, there is a lack of evidence that the Appellants have been charged with any crime, let alone a heinous one. The Principal Appellant was never convicted of a crime, was readily released from detention on a bribe, and did not have an arrest warrant issued. It is unlikely he would be considered a person of high interest by the Haryana police sufficient to cause his identification in databases.33\n[79] When the constable came to the Appellants' house on XXXX XXXX, 2019, to inform the Principal Appellant that the inspector wanted to speak with him, there is no indication he came with an arrest warrant compelling the Principal Appellant to attend.34 The Principal Appellant testified that he was unaware of his name being entered in any database of criminals.35 The Principal Appellant testified that he had not seen a First Information Report issued by the police.36 The Principal Appellant testified that he did not know what they did with his signature, fingerprints or photograph, but was threatened that if he took action against the police, they would implicate him in false charges.37 In order to avoid being falsely charged, the Principal Appellant can avoid taking legal action or making a complaint against the Haryana police for his wrongful detention, which is a reasonable choice to make to free the Appellants of a risk of harm.38\n[80] Perhaps the most compelling evidence is from a top law enforcement official from Haryana state (the Appellants' state). This law enforcement official in Haryana very recently indicated that information from his state is hardly successful at being shared within the state, let alone with other states who are their own \"islands of technology:\"39\nXXXX XXXX, the Inspector General of Police in the state of Haryana, states that India does \"not have any national data[b]ase of criminals or gangs against which suspects can be identified\" (XXXX XXXX XXXX. 2020). The same source further indicates that police systems between districts and states are not integrated, creating \"[i]slands of technology\" which can only communicate within a state or district (XXXX XXXX XXXX. 2020). XXXX notes, for example, that a police officer issuing a traffic ticket would not be aware of the individuals' traffic violation history in other states, and \"mostly [not] even within the state\" (XXXX XXXX XXXX. 2020).\n[81] This is important information as it comes from a top law enforcement official in the Appellants' state indicating that information from his state is not likely transmitted outside the state, and is likely not even successfully transmitted within the state.\n[82] The Haryana police might have falsely alleged that the Principal Appellant was linked to drug dealers in order to justify his initial detention and to demand a bribe for his release, however, there is a lack of evidence that this false initial allegation resulted in any charges or being entered in any sort of database that would be accessible in the proposed IFAs. Regarding whether information on extrajudicial arrests would be captured in criminal databases, an expert opined that \"[n]o official record of such arrests is maintained\" in official criminal databases, including the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems.40 Another expert opined that the Aadhaar Act \"disallow[s]\" the \"linking\" of the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems with the Aadhaar [national ID number] database, thereby \"limiting\" the authorities' ability to \"track offenders,\" especially in cases of first offences.41\n[83] Although the police may have many ways of pursuing a wanted person across the country, it is not relevant in this case as there is insufficient credible evidence that the Appellants' names would appear in a database of wanted persons.42 It is not sufficient for the Appellants to refer to documentary evidence about the ways in which the police might track someone, without establishing a connection between that evidence and the Appellants' specific situation.43\n[84] The Appellants argue that Sikh survivors of human rights abuse cannot live safely or securely in any part of India due to government protection for perpetrators of human rights abuses in Punjab and India, and they refer to an article in support.44 I do not place significant weight on this article as the Appellants have identified in their Basis of Claim forms that they are Hindu.45\n[85] The Appellants argue that the authorities have failed to provide security for the Principal Appellant or his family. I am not persuaded by this submission. I have found, for the reasons set out in this decision, that the Appellants do not face a risk of persecution or of harm or torture from the police in the proposed IFAs. Therefore, the issue of state protection is not relevant.46 There is no need to consider whether state protection is available to respond to a risk that has not been established.47\nSecond Prong: Relocating to Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore is not unreasonable\n[86] With respect to the second prong of the IFA test, I find in all the circumstances, including circumstances particular to the Appellants, that conditions in the IFAs of Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore are such that it would not be unreasonable for them to seek refuge there.\n[87] While moving to a new location is challenging, the Appellants have not provided me with evidence of any circumstances that rise to the level of constituting actual and concrete evidence of conditions that would jeopardize their lives and safety in travelling or temporarily relocating to Kolkata, Mumbai, or Bangalore.\n[88] I admitted as new evidence the Principal Appellant's statement that he and his wife suffer from mental health problems, related to depression and anxiety, which he indicates has worsened after the RPD issued its decision denying their claims. I also admitted the psychologist's report as new evidence. I find this evidence does not assist the Appellants with their claim. Subjective fear is not enough to establish a claim.48 There must be an objective basis for the fear, and for the reasons I have set out in this decision, I have found that there is not an objective basis for the Appellants' fear on a forward-looking basis with respect to Haryana police being motivated to pursue the Appellants to the proposed IFAs.\n[89] The Appellants have not provided evidence supporting that the Appellants would be unable to obtain care for their conditions in the proposed IFAs, all of which are major cities in India. The Appellants have not provided evidence of to what extent and for what reasons their treatment would be different or unobtainable if they relocated to the proposed IFAs.49\n[90] I am not persuaded by the psychiatrist's report as I find it is an attempt to \"usurp the role of the decision-maker\" and is \"[advocating] in the guise of an opinion and 'propos[ing] to settle important issues to be decided by the tribunal.'\"50 After reviewing each of the Appellant's mental status related to their concerns about returning to India, the psychologist states that it is imperative that the Appellants remain in Canada and receive the needed medical and psychological attention to guarantee structure.\"51 The psychologist states that the report confirms the psychological vulnerability associated with a return to India, and that a return to India would be detrimental to the Principal Appellant's mental health leading to potential suicide.52 The psychologist recommends that the couple consult a doctor to help decrease their symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression, as well as suicidal ideation.53\n[91] The psychologist is essentially opining that there is no place in India reasonable for the Principal Appellant to return. The psychiatrist is giving an implicit country condition assessment that effectively precludes the RAD from finding an IFA and \"impermissibly trespassed on the jurisdiction of the RAD to make such a finding - it being the ultimate issue in this case.\"54 In addition, the psychiatrist is effectively rendering an opinion that there is no available treatment for the Appellants in India, or in other words, that they would be untreatable should they return to India, without speaking to the state of mental health treatment in that country.55\n[92] In the psychologist's report there are references to the Appellants' concern about finding work and being able to support their family, including finding housing, due to the expenses not being affordable. The Appellants will have to find work and start over in the proposed IFAs, however such hardship is not sufficient to justify refugee protection. The Federal Court has held that, \"The law is clear that having to start over and having difficulty finding a job are not significant barriers which make an IFA unreasonable.\"56\n[93] The Principal Appellant testified that he cannot do anything besides farming, but this is inconsistent with the fact he found work outside that field in Canada.57 His testimony that he cannot apply the XXXX skills he obtained in Canada because the houses in India are made of brick, not wood as in Canada, is not persuasive as there is a lack of evidence to support his statement. The Associate Appellant's evidence that she could not find work with the job skills she obtained in Canada because, \"...the culture, which I live in, we are not allowed to go outside the home besides that we do not get such type of work over there,\"58 is also without evidentiary support. The Appellants have not provided evidence that they would be unable to find any work in the proposed IFAs where they could employ their past skills or learn new skills.\n[94] The RPD correctly analyzed the specific circumstances of the Appellants, including their education, work skills and experience and language abilities. The RPD correctly found that relocation for the Appellants based on their personal circumstances would not reach the high threshold required to make the proposed IFAs unreasonable. With respect to housing, the Appellants have not provided sufficient evidence that they would be unable to obtain housing. The Federal Court commented, \"Additionally, humanitarian and compassionate reasons, such as the loss of a job, a reduction in the quality of life or the loss of aspiration do not suffice to conclude that there is no IFA.\"59\nCONCLUSION\n[95] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nDerek Vermette\nJanuary 31, 2023\nDate\n1 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n2 RPD Record, Narrative to Basis of Claim form, p. 25.\n3 Appellants' Record, pgs 20-52.\n4 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n5 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX (the appellant) alleges that he is a citizen of Sierra Leone. He is appealing the negative decision issued by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on July 6, 2022, following virtual hearings held on December 9, 2021, May 10, 2022, and June 8, 2022.\n[2] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship intervened to argue that the appellant had failed to establish his identity and his Sierra Leonean citizenship on a balance of probabilities.\n[3] Before the RPD, the determinative issue was credibility with respect to the appellant's identity. Before the Refugee Appeal Division, the determinative issue is the same.\n[4] The appellant alleges that he left Sierra Leone in XXXX 1997, during the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He asserts that he arrived in Senegal in 1998 and left for the United States in 2000 using a friend's passport. The asylum claim he made in the United States was rejected. He crossed the Canada-US border at Roxham Road. He claimed refugee protection there, at the port of entry.\n[5] He alleges that he fears he will be persecuted on the basis of his Fulani ethnicity if he were to return to Sierra Leone.\n[6] It is my opinion that the appellant should have been declared a vulnerable person under Guideline 8 and, potentially, considered assigning him a designated representative to accompany him.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The appeal is allowed. I refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination before a differently constituted panel.\nANALYSIS\n[8] My role is to examine all the evidence, including the recording of the hearing, and to determine whether the RPD decision is correct after an independent assessment of the record.1\nThe Refugee Protection Division erred by failing to ensure that the interpretation was adequate and to apply Guideline 8 with Respect to Vulnerable Persons\n[9] The appellant refers to himself as XXXX XXXX, born in XXXX, Sierra Leone, on XXXX XXXX, 1970. He asserts that he is illiterate and never went to school, apart from studying the Quran. In my view, the RPD erred by failing to apply Guideline 8 with Respect to Vulnerable Persons and to appoint a designated representative to facilitate the appellant's testimony.\n[10] Listening to the RPD hearing, I was able to observe the difficulties the appellant was having understanding the questions and especially answering them, potentially due in part to the difference in accent between the interpreter and the appellant, but also because of marked cultural differences.\n[11] For example, the appellant had difficulty making the distinction between [translation] \"requesting the birth certificate\" and \"obtaining the birth certificate\":\n[Translation]\nMEMBER: Okay, okay, let's see about the year of registration. So, sir, when and how did you receive the original document of the certified true copy of your birth certificate?\nCLAIMANT: I obtained it in Sierra Leone, where I was born.\nMEMBER: Okay. The original document that your counsel presented. Where were you when you received the original document?\nCLAIMANT: I got it in Sierra Leone, I called my friend to send me a copy from Sierra Leone.2\n[12] I consider this excerpt to be illustrative of the communication difficulties between the RPD and the appellant. It is clear that the appellant was not in Sierra Leone when he received the first birth certificate; rather, the certificate was obtained in Sierra Leone. Furthermore, in the second question, the member is referring to the second birth certificate, the original of which was filed by his counsel, which the appellant did not understand. In this next excerpt, one can detect the difficulties that arose in the interpretation, resulting in a response from the appellant that is unintelligible or disconnected from the question:\n[Translation]\nMEMBER: And where were you when you called your friend?\nCLAIMANT: The other, there where I had a mistake, that, that's my friend, XXXX XXXX (ph), who sent it to me in the United States. That wasn't the right one, I was in the United States, who sent me that. This one, I was in Canada, here, so, as my lawyer told me there's a mistake, and I called my friend XXXX XXXX (ph) - XXXX XXXX (ph) who sent it to me, who re-did it, he sent it to me in Canada.\nMEMBER: So, who did you call?\nCLAIMANT: I called XXXX XXXX (ph).\nMEMBER: So, do you remember when you called XXXX XXXX (ph)?\nCLAIMANT: Yes, XXXX XXXX (ph) sent it to me by mail.\nMEMBER: When you say mail, like by email, by DHL or something like that?\nCLAIMANT: I mean by DHL.\nMEMBER: Okay. And where did he obtain the document?\nCLAIMANT: Where they make the documents, over there, where he is.3\n[13] In the next excerpt, the RPD asks questions by compounding them. Responding to the question, the appellant first says \"XXXX 2018\" and then a few sentences that were not interpreted:4\n[Translation]\nMEMBER: And you were in Canada, did you request it, this year, last year? When did you request it?\nCLAIMANT: It was XXXX 2018. (part of the response not interpreted)\nMEMBER: And when did you receive the document?\nCLAIMANT: The documents from Sierra Leone or from Canada?\nMEMBER: The document, the original that was sent from Sierra Leone.\nCLAIMANT: It came just two (2) days ago and my lawyer here.\nMEMBER: Okay. But you requested it in XXXX 2018.\nCLAIMANT: Yes, that's when they called me for the first judgment in XXXX, it was after that that I called him, I told him to help me obtain it.\nMEMBER: So you called him that year?\nCLAIMANT: Yes, that year.5\n[14] I note that the hearing recording reveals that the appellant responded, before the interpretation, directly to the member's comment [translation] \"But you requested it in XXXX 2018\" by \"no no...\" and not \"yes.\" Indeed, the rest of his answer indicates that he called his friend after [translation] \"the first judgment in XXXX,\" which possibly refers to the judgment on his asylum claim in the US, but the evidence does not indicate when this US decision refusing him asylum was handed down. Everything leads me to believe that the appellant did not understand the question that followed, i.e., \"so you called him that year?\" This information is crucial for evaluating the authenticity of the second certificate, which was found not to be credible on the basis of his testimony.\n[15] In my opinion, this case involves marked cultural differences exacerbated by the appellant's profile as an illiterate person who has never attended school. I was also able to observe the trouble the appellant was having situating events in time, especially after his arrival in the United States, which is common in that area of the world among people who have not received an education. It should also be noted that the appellant does not have a more direct, western-style speech pattern, but rather uses a roundabout speech pattern. For these reasons, I consider that the RPD erred and should have declared the appellant a vulnerable person pursuant to Chairperson's Guideline 8 and provided appropriate accommodations, including an in-person hearing with simple questions, not compound ones. In addition to the other interpretation issues identified below, I also note that the interpreter was interrupted several times by her telephone ringing and that she asked for a break because she was [translation] \"yawning a lot,\" which is inappropriate and unprofessional. In my view, therefore, these deficiencies amount to a violation of the appellant's right to procedural fairness, necessitating referral of the matter to the RPD for re-determination. It also seems to me necessary to consider whether a designated representative should be assigned to him to assist him in the proceeding and help him express himself so that he can fully present his case.\nOther errors committed by the Refugee Protection Division\n[16] The RPD concluded that the appellant had failed to establish his identity and nationality on a balance of probabilities because he did not provide reasonable explanations for the following issues: (i) the fact that he took no steps to make contact with the Embassy of Sierra Leone in Canada; (ii) the errors with respect to his date and place of birth in the birth certificate issued in 2000 (2000 Certificate); (iii) the circumstances surrounding how he obtained the birth certificate dated 2017 (2017 Certificate); (iv) the US identity documents not being issued on the basis of reliable proof of identity; (v) the fact that he has no letter of support from his wife and his son in Senegal; (vi) not having made any effort to find his Sierra Leone national identity card; (vii) Soninke is spoken in several West African countries; and (viii) the discrepancies between his testimony and the content of the affidavits of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, stripping them of their probative weight.\n[17] The RPD drew a negative inference against the appellant's credibility because, in its view, he had not produced a reasonable justification for his failure to contact the Embassy of Sierra Leone in Canada.\n[18] I note that a simple search of the Global Affairs Canada website shows that Sierra Leone has no embassy or consulate in Canada and that diplomatic services are provided by the Sierra Leonean Embassy in Washington D.C.6 I am of the opinion, therefore, that any contacts made by the appellant would have yielded no results whatsoever. It was also reasonable to expect that the appellant, who is illiterate, would have thought that the 2017 Certificate was sufficient to establish his identity. This conclusion must be reversed, in my opinion, since the RPD erred by requiring the appellant to contact the Embassy of Sierra Leone in Canada.7\n[19] The RPD considered that a copy of the 2000 Certificate mistakenly indicated that the appellant was born on XXXX XXXX XXXX 1970, at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, whereas he testified that he was born on XXXX XXXX, 1970, at the XXXX hospital. The RPD was of the opinion that the appellant was unable to explain why this document contained errors and that it was therefore insufficient to establish the appellant's identity.\n[20] The appellant replied that it was unreasonable for the RPD to find that the lack of a passport undermined his credibility. He also argued that the inaccuracies in the 2000 Certificate should not undermine his credibility, as he was able to file a more recent copy of his birth certificate issued in 2017 indicating the correct information regarding his date and place of birth.\n[21] I note a significant irregularity in the 2000 Certificate: a spelling error in the letterhead indicating the name of the ministry responsible for the birth register, namely, the \"Ministry of Health and Sanitaion\" instead of \"Ministry of Health and Sanitation.\" However, this deficiency was not brought to the attention of the appellant at the hearing. If this certificate is not authentic, that explained the errors reported in the first place by the appellant himself to his lawyer when he claimed asylum in the United States, and then subsequently noted by the RPD.\n[22] Regarding his place of birth, I am of the opinion that, in the context of Sierra Leone in the 1970s, when the appellant was born, it is possible that civil registers were unreliable or were subsequently reconstructed. The exact place of birth, whether at home or in hospital, can be considered secondary, especially when the two places are close to each other in the same city and country. Indeed, XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX) Hospital in XXXX are located in the same district of XXXX XXXX.8\n[23] I note that the RPD considered the appellant to speak Soninke, which is a language spoken widely in Senegal and in Mali. Here, the appellant spoke in Pular (not to be confused with Pulaar), which is a language spoken mainly in Guinea, Mali and Sierra Leone, but not in Senegal. In my view, it was the RPD's duty to correctly identify the appellant's mother tongue before considering it in order to reject his refugee protection claim.9\n[24] I find that the appellant's testimony with respect to the events of the civil war is correct, mainly with respect to how the Kabbah government was toppled in May 1997. Indeed, a simple search shows that on May 25, 1997, a military junta called Armed Forces Revolutionary Forces (AFRC) joined forces with the rebel group the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to take the capital Freetown. The coup d'\u00e9tat was therefore perpetrated by both the military and the rebels, which could lead to confusion, and the word [translation] \"rebel\" was used to designate members of both groups.10 I find therefore that the content of the affidavits filed by the appellant, the information in the National Documentation Package, and the appellant's testimony are all consistent in this regard.\n[25] However, I note that the RPD did not question the appellant on how he obtained the affidavits that he filed in evidence, especially given the fact that at the hearing he did not know what an affidavit was.11 It would appear that the originals were not submitted before the RPD, nor did the RPD ask for them. It would be necessary to determine where they come from.\n[26] In these circumstances, and considering the appellant's difficulty situating events on a timeline, in addition to the interpretation and language challenges, it is impossible for me to determine on a balance of probabilities whether the 2017 Certificate is authentic or not. It is my opinion that this is the crux of the problem. The discrepancies between his testimony and the written evidence regarding the events surrounding his departure from XXXX are relevant to, but not determinative of, his identity. They will be more so when considering the merits of his refugee protection claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The appeal is allowed. I refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination before a differently constituted panel with the instructions set out below.\nINSTRUCTIONS TO THE REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION\n[28] Pursuant to Chairperson's Guideline 8, I consider it important to provide accommodations to the appellant to minimize communication problems. For example, the following should be considered:\n- Holding the hearing in person rather than virtually to facilitate non-verbal communication;\n- Choosing a Pular-English or Pular-French interpreter, preferably one from Sierra Leone or Guinea to minimize differences between accents;\n- Conducting the hearing in English, not in French;\n- Appointing a designated representative to accompany him in the proceeding;\n- Avoiding compound or complex questions, and dividing them up to pose one question at a time; and\n- Taking into consideration the appellant's difficulties situating events in time, as well as the other cultural differences, such as language patterns that may be less direct or straightforward.\n(signed)\nMe Martine Durocher\nMe Martine Durocher\nDecember 14, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Motifs et d\u00e9cision\nPerson who is the subject of the appeal\nXXXX XXXX XXXX\nPersonne en cause\nDate of decision\nFebruary 8, 2023\nDate de la d\u00e9cision\nPanel\nJulie Ryan\nTribunal\nCounsel for the person who is the subject of the appeal\nArvin Afzali\nConseil de la personne en cause\nDesignated representative\nN\/A\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I dismiss this appeal. XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant) appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) that refused her application for refugee protection on July 14, 2022. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria. She alleges a fear persecution in Nigeria at the hands of her uncle, the XXXX XXXX, and the Fulani Herdsmen based on her Christian religion. The RPD had credibility concerns, nonetheless, found the determinative issue for the RPD was internal flight alternative (IFA). The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) finds the determinative issue is also IFA.\n[2] Given the Appellant is a woman, when assessing this appeal, I considered the Chairperson Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board (Gender Guideline).1 When I consider and apply the Gender Guideline, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant has an IFA reasonably available to her and therefore her appeal must fail.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[4] Contrary to the Appellant's submissions regarding the standard of review of reasonableness that the RAD should be applying, my role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 The Appellant relied on the Federal Court decision Rozas del Solar3 rather than the Federal Court of Appeal which I relied on.\nBACKGROUND\n[5] According to the evidence before me, the Appellant was born into the Christian faith. She seeks protection against Nigeria for fear of persecution from non-Christians in her town due to her practice of the Christian faith. The Appellant resided in the United States of America (USA) between 2014 to 2019. While in the USA, the Appellant married twice, with the second marriage resulting in a refused green card application. In XXXX 2019, she voluntarily returned to Nigeria. She and her second husband divorced. While in Nigeria, she lived in hiding as she was fearful of being targeted because of her religion. In XXXX 2019, she visited Canada. The Appellant returned to Nigeria in XXXX 2019 and again went into hiding. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the Appellant's mother died and months later her sister lost the use of her legs; she did not attend her mother's funeral. The Appellant alleges the incidents were the result of a voodoo spell placed on her mother and sister. She asserts they were targeted because of their Christian faith. As a result, the Appellant fears for her father and siblings in Nigeria. She returned to Canada in XXXX 2019. The Appellant initiated a refugee claim in July 2021 due to her religious beliefs. She also fears persecution in Nigeria at the hands of the XXXX XXXX, and the Fulani Herdsman because of their close ties to the current Nigerian President. In her amended Basis of Claim (BOC), the Appellant alleges that she later learned in XXXX 2022 that her uncle was behind the voodoo attacks against her mother and her sister, she therefore fears persecution from her uncle.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nSome of the evidence presented by the Appellant are accepted while others are rejected\n[6] The Appellant presented two sets of new evidence, the first with her Memorandum of Appeal (Memo) and second post her memorandum of appeal. The list of documents presented with her Memo are as follows:\nA. Affidavit of the Appellant, sworn XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022;4\nB. Affidavit of the Appellant's sister, sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022;5\nC. Police Investigation Report of the Appellant's sister, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;6\nD. Facebook post of news Article, \"Heritage and Traditions - HRH. The Akran of Badagry, Aholu Wheno Menu-Toyi 1 the Akran...,\" Facebook.com, dated July 1, 2017;7\nE. Letter from Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture (CCVT) regarding the Appellant, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022;8\nF. Letter from a legal practitioner in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;9 and\nG. Written summary of conversation re: Issues on the living conditions in Port Harcourt, undated.10\n[7] According to the Law,11 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[8] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.12\n[9] She submits that the documents are credible as they are from a reliable source; the circumstances of how these documents came into existence are also credible; documents A through G are capable of demonstrating the facts concerning the means and motivation of the agent of harm, her uncle, and the situation in Port Harcourt as it relates to women in that IFA. She argues the new evidence is new as they clearly contradict multiple findings of fact made by the RPD with respect to the first prong of the IFA test as well as the reasonableness of the proposed IFA. She adds the new evidence is material as far as her claim would have been successful had the evidence been made available to the RPD. Lastly, she states that she could not provide the documents sooner because the evidence became mostly available after the RPD hearing. Additionally, she gained knowledge of the name and identity of her uncle after the rejection of her claim and was only able to then obtain relevant documents about him, hence the documents and information were not reasonably available to the Appellant during the RPD stage of the proceedings.\n[10] The Appellant initially incorrectly submitted that the new evidence test is set out in section 113 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) with respect to evidence under the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA),13 applied the correct jurisprudence to her submissions and later submitted the correct test for RAD to determine credibility concerns is under section 110(4) of IRPA.14\nNew evidence in Memo is accepted in part\nA. Affidavit of the Appellant, sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022, accepted in part\n[11] Documents A is allowed in part - only paragraphs 6, 7,8,11 and 12 are new as the Appellant did not challenge the credibility concern that the RPD had regarding her explanation not being able to identify her uncle. She had not reconciled that issue and the portion of the affidavit about her asking her dad about her uncle's identity after the RPD rejection of her claim, when that information was readily available to her throughout her life is not new and could reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been brought to the RPD before the decision. Based on the evidence, her agent of persecution is her maternal uncle whom the family have known through her mother and had issues with for at least a few years prior to the RPD rejecting her claim. As such paragraphs 9 and 10 is not new evidence and fail to meet the law regarding admissibility of new evidence under section 110(4) of the IRPA. Document A is accepted in part as outlined above. I reject paragraph 13 for the following reasons: while the document post dates the RPD rejection of her claim, there is no way to tell if the evidence identified in paragraph 13 is new as the Appellant does not specify which friend she spoke to; whether the friend lives in Port Harcourt at the time of the conversation or elsewhere; when the conversation took place; and why the friend could not provide their own statement. I further note that the Appellant understood the need to put sworn statements before the RPD and the RAD, yet she did not do the same with the summary of a conversation with a friend. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the information in paragraph 13 was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\nNew evidence in Memo accepted\nB. Affidavit of the Appellant's sister, sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022\nC. Police Investigation Report of the Appellant's sister, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022\nE. Letter from CCVT regarding the Appellant, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022\nF. Letter from legal practitioner in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022\n[12] Documents B, C, E, and F are new, and the events and evidence post date the RPD's rejection of her claim. They are credible on face value as sworn statements or evidence given of the Nigerian government and a Nigerian legal practitioner. Documents B, C, E, and F are relevant as they relate to the determinative issue of IFA. I will consider documents B, C, E and F in this appeal.\nNew evidence in Memo rejected\nD. Facebook post of news Article, \"Heritage and Traditions - HRH. The Akran of Badagry, Aholu Wheno Menu-Toyi 1 the Akran...,\" Facebook.com, dated July 1, 2017\n[13] I reject document D first because it is dated XXXX XXXX, 2017, approximately 5 years before the RPD rejection of her claim and for the same reasons I rejected paragraphs 9 and 10 of document A, the Appellant has failed to reconcile why she did not know her uncle's identity, nickname or otherwise. Document D is not new evidence and fails to meet the law regarding admissibility of new evidence under section 110(4) of the IRPA. I will not consider document D.\nG. Written summary of conversation re: Issues on the living condition in Port Harcourt, (undated)\n[14] I reject document G because similar to why I rejected paragraph 13 of document A, document G is not dated nor does it identify who the alleged conversation regarding the situation in Port Harcourt was with, whether the friend who provided the information regarding Port Harcourt lived in that city at the time of the conversation or elsewhere; and why the friend could not provide their own statement. I similarly note that the Appellant understood the need to put sworn statements before the RPD and the RAD, yet document G is not in that format or even by way of a letter for the friend she allegedly spoke to. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the conversation did not take place prior to the RPD rejection of her claim, was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring the evidence to the RPD before the decision given IFA is a live issue in most refugee claims and she filed objective evidence regarding areas that could have been identified by the RPD as a viable IFA. I will not be considering document G in this appeal.\nRule 29 new evidence accepted\n[15] The list of new evidence submitted with the rule 29 application is as follows:\nH. Affidavit of the Appellant, sworn XXXX XXXX, 2022.15\nI. Correspondence and psychologist report of the Appellant from Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.16\n[16] The Appellant has followed Rule 29 and Rule 37 of the RAD rules when filing her application to file late evidence post perfection of her appeal. The evidence is new, and posts dates the RPD rejecting of her claim, the evidence arose after the date of perfection, appears credible as it is a sworn statement and a report from a professional, and is relevant to her appeal, namely related to her mental health and the IFA. Therefore, I accept the Rule 29 application and the new evidence identified as documents H and I.\nANALYSIS\nIFA\nDid the RPD err in its IFA analysis?\n[17] At the hearing, the RPD identified both Abuja and Port Harcourt as possible IFAs but limited its analysis of the availability of an IFA to Port Harcourt in the reasons. It found that her uncle had the means and motivation to find her in the IFA as well as the Bora Haram and Fulani Herdsman would not pose a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm to her in Port Harcourt.\n[18] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in finding that Port Harcourt would be a viable IFA as she fears persecution or physical harm or even death by her uncle if returned to Nigeria. The Appellant relies on new evidence to demonstrate that the first prong of the test fails. She only argues the RPD erred in concluding her uncle did not have the means or motivation.\n[19] The Appellant makes no arguments regarding the RPD findings regarding her allegations concerning the XXXX XXXX and Fulani Herdsmen therefore given RAD Appeals are Appellant driven and I see no errors made by the RPD, those findings stand as made. My reasons will focus on the submissions the Appellant made regarding the first prong as it relates to her uncle and the second prong arguments in light of the new evidence.\n[20] The RPD applied the two-prong test for IFA17 to determine if there is a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm in the proposed IFA and whether the conditions in the proposed IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable to move there, considering the specific circumstances of the Appellant.\nAppellant would not face serious possibility of persecution in the IFA\n[21] There can only be a serious possibility of persecution if the agents of persecution have both the means and the motivation to search for and pursue the Appellant. The RPD found that there was insufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that her uncle would have the means and motivation to locate her in Port Harcourt. The RPD had some credibility concerns which it addressed in its reasons however, the agent of persecution was not one of them.\n[22] After reviewing all the evidence and the new evidence before me, the Appellant has not established that the IFA would not be viable for her. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that her uncle has the means and motivation to find her should she return to Nigeria. She fails on the first prong of the test.\n[23] The Appellant relies on the new evidence, with much emphasis of information on documents I have rejected, document D, to argue that the RPD erred in its assessment of the first prong of the IFA test. Nonetheless, I have considered all the other evidence before me, and those documents accepted that the RPD did not have the benefit of having.\n[24] The RPD correctly concluded that she has not demonstrated that her uncle had the means and motivation to locate her in Port Harcourt. She has not convinced me with her extremely vague and speculative testimony as to what means and motivation her uncle had that have not been reconciled. I agree with the RPD that there is insufficient evidence in the record and in the new evidence before me to suggest that her uncle has the ability, means or motivation to find her in Port Harcourt and her assertions regarding his influence and reach are not founded in the evidence.\n[25] I place no weight on document A to demonstrate the Appellant's uncle has the means and motivation to find her in Port Harcourt.\n[26] I place no weight on document B and C (Sister's affidavit and the Nigerian Police report) as they do not contradict the RPD finding that her uncle, did not have the means or motivation to locate her in Port Harcourt. Though document B suggests the uncle located the Appellant's sister in Abuja and was looking for her, Abuja is not the IFA that was in the RPD reasons. Even if I consider there's some evidence to suggest that the uncle is allegedly motivated to find her as alleged by her sister being located in Abuja, however, this does not credibly convince me that her uncle can locate her in Port Harcourt which is located hundreds of kilometers (kms) away from Abuja and similar proximity of kms from XXXX, which is part of Abuja where the uncle allegedly lived according to her testimony.18\n[27] I place no weight on document E (Letter from CCVT) as this does not demonstrate to me that the RPD erred in finding that her agent of persecution did not have the means and motivation to find her in Port Harcourt.\n[28] The Appellant has failed to meet her onus on the first prong of the test or demonstrate the RPD incorrectly concluded the same.\nPort Harcourt is a viable alternative for the Appellant\n[29] Port Harcourt is a viable alternative for her. The threshold to find a potential IFA unreasonable is a high one which she had not met. The hardship associated with dislocation and relocation is not the kind of undue hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable. As noted above, the standard is high and requires proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in travelling to and in living in the IFA location. As such the IFA test also fails on the second prong of the test for the following reasons.\n[30] When the RPD asked her why she could not move to Port Harcourt, she replied that she could not be safe there because of kidnappings and killings; she did not have any family or friends there; and no place to live.\n[31] I considered the Gender Guideline and the objective evidence for Port Harcourt as to whether the Appellant being a woman would impact her ability to live in Port Harcourt as a viable alternative.\nEmployment and Language\n[32] As noted by the RPD, while the NDP for Nigeria indicates that it can be challenging for single women to find work in Nigeria, the evidence also shows that women who are well-educated fare better.19 As noted by the RPD, the Appellant has a XXXX of XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, and has work experience as a XXXX, a XXXX, and a XXXX XXXX XXXX from the US and Canada. This puts her in a better position than most women seeking work in Nigeria.\n[33] The Appellant argued that the RPD relied on objective evidence that is contradicted by a more recent RIR from 2021 (NGA.200797.E) that indicated that education and employability did not have an impact on the issue of housing and employment in Port Harcourt.\nAppellant's profile\n[34] The Appellant is 31 years old, has XXXX years of XXXX XXXX education. She is single and divorced in the USA. She speaks English. The Appellant has travelled internationally and has gained transferable skills. At the present time, she is single without any dependent children. Hence, the Appellant would stand in a far better position than most women in Port Harcourt in search reintegration in Port Harcourt, including employment.\n[35] Considering NDP Item 5.2820 that the Appellant has pointed me to, NGA200797.E which states that unmarried women \"over a certain age\" and divorced women face stigma and that another source states that women over 30 are treated like leper(s). She further submitted that this objective evidence suggests that many organizations in Nigeria often use politics, favouritism, nepotism, and ethnicity when it comes to employment or training opportunities which makes accessing employment and training \"very hard\" for female heads of households and that the same source noted that it may be less difficult for women from wealthy families or women with connections with strong politicians or elites to access employment among other things. I have read the entirety of Item 5.28 which also indicates:\n\"that resettlement success generally depends on the following factors: skill(s) of the woman concerned; social networks\/connections; age of the woman (younger women are [better] able to resettle than older women who have spent years and time in a previous location); number of children (larger families are usually more challenging in terms of the demand for size accommodations, schools for the children, availability of health facilities, etc.) among others. The field of employment is also a factor since those who are skilled workers in such sought-after areas as [information and communication technology], oil services, and perhaps banking may find it easier resettling since they may have more job opportunities or likelihood of finding jobs in the new location. (Professor 5Nov2021)\"21\n[36] I will assess the various factors and address the concerns raised by the RPD ignoring item 5.28 as it arises in my reasons.\n[37] Turning to document F22 (Letter from the legal practitioner in Port Harcourt) I first highlight that the author is a legal practitioner in Property\/Estate Consultancy and Educational Consultancy as noted on the letterhead of his letter of advice. I considered his opinion that so many companies have relocated out of Port Harcourt as the former industrial layout at trans-amadi is more of a graveyard now making security of jobs, which is contrary to Item 5.28 that the Appellant referred me to as noted above, and livelihood highly difficult for her inhabitants.23 Considering the Appellant's background is not in the oil industry and more in service - XXXX, XXXX and the XXXX field, I place no weight on the opinion of the lawyer in Nigeria and find the Appellant has not demonstrated she would not be in a position to find a job suited to her experience. I also considered that the legal practitioner suggests that the tertiary students, which I understand to be post secondary education, have been on strike for the past five months and most people have travelled out of the country to get a good education, I find this sharing of his opinion also has no bearing on the Appellant as she has her degrees and there is no evidence that she plans to return to further her education. For those reasons, I place no weight on document F as it relates to employment or education.\nObjective evidence suggests that educated and skilled women obtain employment\n[38] As it relates to employment, the objective evidence suggests that women are the \"majority\" in the informal economy mainly because they are not educated or skilled.24 The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that she would not be able to find employment or need education, which is not the profile of the Appellant in this appeal. Overall, as I read the objective evidence, her profile would not place her in the circumstances of lack of employment or discrimination pointed to in the NDP Item 5.28, nor make her relocation to the IFA unreasonable.\nAccommodation\n[39] I have considered the objective evidence that demonstrates there could be challenges involved for single women when seeking accommodations in Nigeria. The objective evidence also suggests that with a letter from an employer demonstrating she can pay for her accommodations, finding one is possible. Her personal situation of not having family or friends in Port Harcourt does not render it unreasonable to expect her to relocate to Port Harcourt to avoid the persecution she alleges, nor does it mean she would not be able to find accommodations there. When turning to Item 5.28,1.3 Housing25 although it states that sources indicate that single women renting accommodations face discrimination and there is a housing crisis, the example used is that of women that are HIV-positive. In the circumstances of this appeal, the Appellant has not alleged she is HIV-positive so that possible discrimination does not apply to her, and she has not filed evidence to support that Port Harcourt has a housing crisis to the point that she would be unable to find any accommodations.\n[40] I also note that document F is silent on whether the Appellant could find accommodations in Port Harcourt.\n[41] She has not filed any other evidence to support that she would not be able to find accommodations. Access to accommodations does not render the IFA unreasonable. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that she could not find accommodations in the IFA in her personal circumstances.\nReligion, Transportation and Travel\n[42] The Appellant does not challenge religion, transportation, or travel factors in rendering the IFA unreasonable.\n[43] The Appellant is a Christian, and there appears to be no impediment for her to practice her religion in Port Harcourt.26 Port Harcourt has an airport, and there does not seem to be any impediment for the Appellant to travel through the areas where the alleged agents of persecution reside. She has failed to demonstrate that religion, transportation, and travel would render the IFA unreasonable in her personal circumstances.\nIndigeneship\n[44] Also, the Appellant cites the NDP to establish the challenges with respect to indigeneship in Nigeria. The documentation the Appellant cites, however, was not the current NDP at the time of the hearing. She has not raised indigenous issues before the RPD, and I find there are none since the objective evidence states that indigeneship status is less important in big cities such as Port Harcourt because of the large number of people relocating to the city.27 The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that indigeneship issues would render the IFA unreasonable in her personal circumstances.\nAccess to Health Care\n[45] The Appellant would be able to access health care in the IFA. The RPD correctly concluded the same.\n[46] The RPD had a psychological assessment from Dr. XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2022,28 and the CCVT report dated XXXX XXXX, 2022,29 and found in its reasons why this evidence was not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable. The RPD relied on the objective evidence30 to find that despite it being difficult to obtain mental health care in Nigeria, due to insufficient human resources, such care is available and centralized in urban areas such as Port Harcourt. More specifically, the RPD concluded:\nThe psychological report before the RPD:\n* stated the Appellant suffered from XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX;\n* noted that the Appellant experiences XXXX XXXX XXXX but that she denies current XXXX XXXX and additionally upon being questioned by her counsel about the psychological effects of returning to Nigeria, she testified that \"I could XXXX myself if I return there\";\n* spoke about the impact of removal to Nigeria but did not address the extent to which and the reasons why the Appellant's conditions would worsen upon relocation to the proposed IFA of Port Harcourt;\n* it noted that the traumatizing events of the Appellant's mother's murder and sister's injury did not occur in Port Harcourt; and\n* aside from the suggested treatment referred to, the psychological report did not discuss the specific type of treatment she must undergo in Canada and to what extent and for what reasons this treatment would be different if the Appellant relocates to the proposed IFA.\nThe CCVT report before the RPD:\n* the CCVT letter indicates that the Appellant is suffering XXXX.\n[47] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of the reasonableness of the proposed IFA: namely erred in its assessment on the employment and housing available; the lack of presence of family and friends in the IFA location; her lack of access to health care, the assessment of psychological report, and that the RPD ignored relevant NDP documentary evidence. At appeal, the Appellant filed new evidence E: new psychological report from the same psychologist, Dr. XXXX and I: new letter from the CCVT by the same counsellor that was focused on urging the RAD that all the evidence demonstrates that the Appellant does not have a reasonable IFA in Nigeria.\nThe RPD correctly concluded that the CCVT letter was not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable\n[48] The RPD correctly found that the CCVT letter was not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable.\n[49] Turning my mind to the first letter of the CCVT, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, I agree with the RPD that the CCVT suggested that the Appellant suffered from XXXX from a traumatic experience. By the time of the dated letter, the Appellant had attended two counselling sessions with their organization. That the CCVT had assessed the Appellant as a victim of torture and provided their holistic services - sessions were combined general counselling and narrative therapy. It notes that during the counselling visits, it was apparent that the traumatic incidents she faced severely affected her mental health and increased her XXXX. The CCVT letter says her family had been forcing her to participate in cultural rites and rituals, which was against her personal values and beliefs. That they will continue to support her on an ongoing basis.\n[50] The CCVT letter before the RPD is Appellant driven. The information provided by the Appellant to the CCVT contradicts her BOC, namely that she feared her uncle who she claims will force her to participate in cultural rites and rituals and denounce her Christianity which she does not want to do. For me, this evidence suggests the Appellant suffers from XXXX and has attended two counselling sessions with the CCVT to deal with her XXXX from a traumatic event which in my view is incorrectly shared as the Appellant has never stated to the RPD that she was forced to do anything yet. I place no weight on the CCVT, the RPD correctly found that this evidence was not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable.\nSeeking refuge in the proposed IFA would not be unreasonable because of health care\nDocument E is not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable\n[51] Despite the RPD not having the benefit of document E, the recent CCVT letter, the RAD did and I turned my mind to this evidence as well. By XXXX XXXX, 2022, almost two months since the first letter, the Appellant had still only attended two counselling sessions. Again, this letter suggests that the Appellant explained that her family had been forcing her to participate in cultural rites and rituals, which was against her personal values and beliefs. Despite not having returned to counselling since the first letter referred to above, this letter indicates that the traumatic incidents she faced severely affected her mental health and that she showed signs of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX while discussing the details of her story. It expanded on the information the Appellant provided the CCVT while discussing details of her story and also highlighted that she mentioned having XXXX thoughts because of the stress of her refugee claim - having expressed that she would rather XXXX XXXX XXXX instead of suffering in Nigeria. It further adds that the Appellant's poor mental health is an extreme concern and will need additional counselling and psychological support.\n[52] The Appellant driven information given to the CCVT in my view differs from her BOC because the CCVT appears to believe, as noted in both letters, that the Appellant \"had been forced to participate in cultural rites and rituals.\" The Appellant alleges fear of being forced into participating in cultural rites and rituals. I also find the original CCVT letter initially does state she suffers from XXXX which differs from Dr. XXXX diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX. Then the second CCVT letter changes the anxiety diagnosis to signs of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX while discussing the details of her story. Though authored by the same trauma settlement counsellor at the CCVT, the second letter does not explain to me why the details are different when the author had not seen the Appellant since the XXXX 2022 letter was written. I do not minimize the effects of anxiety or any other mental health issues on one's life however, I do not place any weight on either CCVT letters to demonstrate that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable and also rely on the objective evidence31 that suggests care is available in Port Harcourt. I place no weight on document E (Letter from CCVT regarding the Appellant, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022) for the above noted reasons.\nRPD correctly found the psychological report before them was not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable\n[53] Turning to the initial psychological report that was before the RPD, again the information provided is client driven, therefore the Appellant provided her account of issues to Dr. XXXX. Similarly, to the RPD, I accept the diagnosis in the report which suggests that Appellant suffers from XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX and XXXX with XXXX XXXX.32 He adds that she requires mental-health treatment which might include stress-management training, behavioural activation, and cognitive-behaviour therapy. Dr. XXXX notes her condition will deteriorate with exposure to further threats of harm; XXXXPT risk will increase. Contrary to the CCVT letter, Dr. XXXX report highlights the Appellant's future fear of being forced to denounce her faith and her fear of being captive and that they may kill her like they did her mother.33 I acknowledge the impact of trauma differs for each person, that the report indicates that the Appellant does not wish to go back to Nigeria, she does not want to die and she does not want to commit suicide either but the thought of being unable to stay in Canada may lead her to doing that.34 The RPD correctly suggested that aside from the suggested treatment referred to in the psychological report, which might include stress-management training, behavioral activation, and cognitive behavior therapy,35 it did not discuss the specific type of treatment she must undergo in Canada and to what extent and for what reasons this treatment would be different if the Appellant relocates to the proposed IFA. The RPD correctly concluded that the psychological report was not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable.\nDocument I is not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable\n[54] Document I (Dr. XXXX recent psychologist report dated XXXX XXXX, 2022) is new evidence and was not before the RPD. As per section 8.5 of the Gender Guideline, I have considered the expert reports by her psychologists, but I place no weight on document I for the following reasons. Firstly, the first part of her new evidence is correspondence with Dr. XXXX to obtain and then receive the second psychological report which bears nothing with regards to whether she can access health care in Nigeria. Secondly, I place no weight on document I because Dr. XXXX report engages in advocacy or offers opinions outside his expertise.36 The Federal court37 has often found that Dr. XXXX reports cross the line separating expert opinion from advocacy. I come to the same conclusion in this appeal since document I is a response to the RPD's assessment of his initial report and about the availability of psychological treatment in Nigeria.38 Dr. XXXX comments such as the RPD's findings are illogical and its justifications are not clear.39 Another example of his advocacy is him pointing the RPD reference to the objective evidence and the lack of relevant consideration which involves the degree to which mental-health services are available in Nigeria.40 Dr. XXXX submits that the RPD to dismiss the contribution of the psychological assessment he provided for [the Appellant] reflects a variety of errors: a) a misunderstanding of the report's intended purpose; b) the assertion that it did not, but should have described the mechanism (s) by which the predicted harms might have developed should [the Appellant] return to her country of origin; c) a lack of familiarity with the fact that the recommended psychological treatments are explicitly described in the professional literature and do not require further explication; and d) minimization of the difficulties [the Appellant] is likely to experience in accessing mental-health treatment in her country of origin.41 Lastly, Dr. XXXX further adds, \"it seems unjustified, therefore, to employ these arguments to dismiss the information and recommendations provided in the psychological assessment in adjudicating [the Appellant's] refugee claim. With respect to Dr. XXXX and his expertise in psychology, I place no weight on document I since he has clouded his expertise with adjudicating the Appellant's alleged errors made in her refugee claim which is not for him to do. The RAD is best placed to determine whether the RPD findings are incorrect based on the law and jurisprudence.42\n[55] Document I, similar to the initial psychological report, is not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable in all the circumstances of her case.\nObjective evidence is not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable\n[56] Objective documentation in the NDP reports that mental health resources in Nigeria are not sufficient for the country's needs. There are less than 300 psychiatrists to serve Nigeria's population of over 180 million people. Also, mental health issues are highly stigmatized in Nigeria, which results in many hiding their conditions or blaming them on curses or witchcraft.43\n[57] Human Rights Watch reports that, \"deep rooted problems in Nigeria's healthcare and welfare systems leave most Nigerians unable to get adequate mental health care....\"44 There is widespread stigma about mental health conditions, including a misperception that they are caused by evil sprits. Thousands of people with mental health conditions are chained up and abused in facilities for years. Both private and government-run facilities and hospitals lock up and chain people against their will. They are unable to choose to leave.45\n[58] Documentation in the NDP reports that quality mental health services are only available to the wealthy in Nigeria.46 Therefore, based on my findings that she has the skills and abilities to get a job and has worked in Canada, she should have some financial means to access mental health services should she require and wish to continue receiving those services. The Appellant has the ability to access any required treatment for her XXXX XXXX and XXXX therefore not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable.\n[59] I further note that the Dr. XXXX reports suggest the Appellant has coping mechanisms such as going in the shower or reading the bible, etc. and there is no other evidence before me to suggest she has made use of the ongoing CCTV counselling offered to her in Canada since she only attended two sessions since XXXX 2022 or that she could not continue with the coping mechanisms noted above that appear to work for her in Port Harcourt.\n[60] Turning to Item 5.2847 access to public services including health care in Port Harcourt are available only if \"they are able to pay for these services\" which is not free, and no subsidy is available. There is no evidence of costs associated for health care let alone mental health care in Nigeria. The Appellant has also not demonstrated that costs associated with her specific health care needs would be at the level which outweigh the other factors that I have accessed. Overall, she has failed to demonstrate that relocating to Port Harcourt is unreasonable in her circumstances.\n[61] The Appellant's mental health needs are a factor that has been considered and weighed accordingly but overall do not make relocating in Nigeria unreasonable in the circumstances of her case. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that heath care would render the IFA unreasonable in her personal circumstances.\nExperience of trauma is not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable\n[62] The Appellant alleges that her mother's murder and sister's injury which she blames her uncle for, are traumatic events in her life. The RPD found that the traumatic events previously noted, did not take place in Port Harcourt. It also drew a negative credibility inference on her allegations that she fears persecution in Nigeria based on her religion, despite finding the determinative issue to be IFA, the Appellant had not convinced the RPD that her claim was credible.\n[63] The traumatic events as viewed by the Appellant is her perception of the circumstances that have occurred in her family's life, one which the RPD did not pronounce as credible. The RPD was correct in finding that these events did not take place in Port Harcourt. The RPD failed to consider whether the traumatic events would sufficiently show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable. The RAD finds it would not for the following reasons.\n[64] The burden of IFA rests with the Appellant to show that an IFA does not exist, taking the approach that the Appellant is not obliged to go into hiding to be safe in the IFA, the Appellant has not demonstrated that she would be located by her agent of persecution in Port Harcourt nor that she would have to cease communicating with her family in Nigeria as she testified to doing once a week. The Appellant has not demonstrated that her trauma would render her seeking refuge in the proposed IFA unreasonable.\n[65] Lastly, based on the RPD proceedings, though its reasons do not explicitly say so, the RPD demonstrated an approach to the claim that was sensitive to help prevent re-traumatization through the IRB decision-making process which demonstrates to me the Gender Guideline was at least in the back of its mind whether it expressed it in writing or not. The RPD asked the Appellant relevant questions regarding her actions on Facebook after her mother's alleged murder and why she waited so long to submit a refugee claim given she said she learned that her mother was murdered in 2019 but did not focus on that or her sister's health concerns as the traumatic events as alleged. The record shows that the RPD offered to take a break four times and advised the Appellant to let it know if a break was needed at any time, the Appellant never asked for a break. I have also considered the diagnosis of XXXX as it relates to whether or not the Appellant was unable to provide chronological or coherent testimony regarding a traumatic event48 but other than not knowing the identity of her uncle, I did not find the Appellant's ability to be hindered. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that her experience of trauma is sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable.\nOther considerations by the RAD\n[66] Lastly, I considered document F which refers to the environmental pollution in Port Harcourt that has made many families relocate from the city back south and has contributed to the ill health of so many and left more in hospitals for their lives. On this point, I place no weight on the legal practitioner opinion that speaks to the environmental pollution or medical system because it also engages in offering an opinion outside his expertise.49 The Appellant has also not alleged that environmental pollution would prevent her from being able to relocate to Port Harcourt. This evidence is not sufficient to show that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable.\nGender Guideline overall does not support her claim\n[67] I have considered and applied the Gender Guideline to my reasons since the Appellant is a woman who fears persecution. I have read both the RPD's decision and the transcript of the hearing and listened to the proceeding. My assessment is that the RPD undertook the hearing in a respectful manner and with due regard for the particular circumstances of the Appellant as outlined above. I have also undertaken my assessment in light of the Gender Guideline where I am to consider religious, economic, social, and cultural factors, and any other relevant factor to assess the reasonableness of the IFA50 for a woman fearing possible gender-related persecution such as gender inequality. I have reviewed all of these factors in light of the Gender Guideline, and my finding remains that it would not be unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to Port Harcourt. The Appellant's personal situation is not a claim which would be impacted by the Gender Guideline to the point that would lead me to conclude that claim should be allowed.\nRAD measures taken regarding her mental health and notice of receiving this decision\n[68] At the forefront, it remains important to me to take into consideration the Appellant's mental health. Having read how she would consider suicide if not allowed to stay in Canada, given my rejection of her appeal, I find it of utter importance that the RAD continues to put her mental health's interest and accommodate her in such a way that she may have the support system available to her when being delivered this decision. As such, I am instructing the RAD registry to send two copies of these reasons to her counsel so that appropriate arrangements can be made to share my reasons for decision with her. The Appellant will receive a copy of my reasons through her counsel as a matter of registry procedures.\nCONCLUSION\n[69] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJulie Ryan\nJulie Ryan\nFebruary 8, 2023\nDate\n1 Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the IRPA, July 18, 2022.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

His extended family did not believe he was worthy of his inheritance because of his conversion.\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellant's claim based on credibility, failure to make an asylum claim in the United States of America (U.S.) and the viability of an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Abuja, Nigeria.\n[5] The Appellant appeals this decision, asking that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) substitute a positive decision or remit the matter to a newly constituted panel of the RPD for redetermination. The Appellant does not submit new evidence on appeal nor has an oral hearing been requested.\n[6] The Appellant submits the RPD erred by committing a breach of procedural fairness, in assessing credibility and the viability of the proposed IFA location.\n[7] The determinative issue on appeal is the viability of an IFA in Abuja, Nigeria.\n[8] After an independent review of the record, including reading the transcript of the hearing before the RPD, conducted on two sittings on May 5, 2022, and July 12, 2022, analyzing all of the evidence and considering all of the Appellant's arguments, I find the RPD decision was correct. The Appellant has a viable IFA in Abuja, Nigeria.\nDECISION\n[9] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[10] The Appellant was born to a Muslim family and following his father's death he converted to Christianity in 1999. The Appellant's conversion occurred after his father's passing and his father's siblings demanded that he give-up his inheritance since he was no longer a Muslim.\n[11] In 2012 verbal confrontations with his extended family escalated to a physical assault on the Appellant. In 2013 the Appellant's spouse was abducted and her family was able to secure her release. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, extended family members destroyed the Appellant's property. The Appellant's property was again damaged in XXXX 2016. The Appellant sought police assistance. Police visited his home and photographed his destroyed property; however, the police did not take any further action. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the Appellant relocated from Ibadan to another location within Oyo State, XXXX Town, Nigeria.\n[12] After relocating individuals began searching for him in XXXX Town. In XXXX 2016 the Appellant's car and passport were stolen and during the theft, he was threatened and told to leave Nigeria. The Appellant also alleges that his extended family is politically connected through the All Progressives Congress (APC) political party. The Appellant's stolen passport was subsequently returned to him. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the Appellant travelled to the USA. The Appellant investigated claiming asylum, however he was unable to afford a lawyer and fearful of U.S. immigration policy, and the Appellant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. He subsequently made a refugee protection claim on October 25, 2017.\nANALYSIS\n[13] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1\nThe RPD did not err in assessing credibility\nThe 2016 affidavit from the Appellant's Nigerian lawyer\n[14] The Appellant's first refugee protection hearing was held over two sittings on October 8,\n2020 and April 26, 2021. The RPD rendered a negative decision on May 14, 2021. The Appellant\nappealed the decision to the RAD. The Appellant alleged that there was a breach of procedural fairness because an affidavit from the Appellant's lawyer in Nigeria was not disclosed after a parcel containing multiple documents was intercepted by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). On November 25, 2021, the RAD allowed the Appellant's appeal and ordered that the matter be referred to the RPD for redetermination before a differently constituted panel. The RAD found several inconsistencies between the CBSA's Notice of Seizure, and the contents of the parcel that was intercepted, and the disclosed documents. The RAD was unable to determine whether the parcel contained the affidavit from the Appellant's Nigerian lawyer and found the Appellant's right to put forward his case had been breached, as a result. On April 26, 2022, the RPD requested in writing from the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) at Etobicoke, Ontario clarification regarding the number of documents seized and copies of those documents. On April 29, 2022, the Minister responded and indicated that the CBSA in Montreal had been contacted regarding the request.\n[15] At the first sitting of the RPD hearing on May 5, 2022, the Member informed the Appellant and his Counsel that no response had been received from CBSA Montreal. It remains unclear whether an affidavit was sent, seized and not disclosed by the CBSA. At the previous hearing before the RPD, the Appellant testified that his family members threatened his Nigerian lawyer causing his lawyer to cease his representation of the Appellant. He also testified that his then former lawyer was retained by the agents of harm. Counsel argued that the Nigerian lawyer's affidavit could have corroborated aspects of the Appellant's claim, including informing the assessment of IFA. I concur with Counsel. However, I do not find the contents of the alleged affidavit would be determinative of the claim based on an assessment of IFA. This is discussed below in assessing IFA.\n[16] During testimony on July 12, 2022, before the RPD, the Appellant did not reference that his Nigerian lawyer was retained by the agents of harm. He testified that his former Nigerian lawyer joined his persecutors and their political party, the APC.2 The Appellant testified further that he believed his lawyer authored the affidavit in 2016 because the affidavit's intent was to inform the Appellant that his lawyer could not proceed with his case.\n[17] I find the Appellant's allegations credible leading up to his departure from Nigeria in 2016, on a balance of probabilities. I find the Appellant was threatened and assaulted by his extended family based on an inheritance disagreement and the Appellant's religious conversion. As such, I find credible that the Appellant's Nigerian lawyer was threatened, represented, at least at the time of the Appellant's disassociation from the lawyer, and subsequently joined the APC. I will assess the Appellant's allegations concerning his Nigerian lawyer in relation to the assessment of IFA.\nThe RPD did not err in relation to the 2021 attack\n[18] The RPD did not find credible the allegation that the Appellant's spouse was attacked on the way to a vigil in XXXX 2021, on a balance of probabilities. The Appellant submitted a Police Extract from the Nigerian Police Force on XXXX XXXX, 2021, wherein the Appellant's spouse documents the alleged attack. The RPD found the contents of the report contradicted the Appellant's testimony. The Appellant testified that his spouse informed him that the attack was directed by his father's siblings whereas the account in the Police Extract attributes the attack to cultists. Moreover, the RPD compared the Police Extract to samples provided in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nigeria and found the Nigerian Police logo was inconsistent with the samples in the NDP. The RPD noted that the documentary evidence indicates that police documents in Nigeria are uniform or standardized. I concur with the RPD.3\n[19] The Police Extract does not conform with the samples provided in the NDP with respect to basic elements. I agree with the RPD concerning the logo discrepancy and also note the Police Extract submitted as evidence appears dissimilar to the samples provided in the NDP. The submitted Police Extract has misaligned margins, uncentred logos, and a large stamp, \"CID,\" overlaying and obscuring the text. CID is an acronym for \"Criminal Investigation Department\" and the overlay is not listed as a feature in the samples provided in the NDP. As such, I draw a negative credibility inference concerning the authenticity of the submitted document.\n[20] Also submitted as evidence is a letter4 from the General Hospital in Ilorin, Nigeria concerning the hospitalization of the Appellant's spouse. The account of the attack in the hospital letter differs from the allegations made in the Police Extract. Despite the hospital letter referencing that the Appellant's spouse had already contacted the authorities regarding the attack, the letter references the Appellant's spouse alleging that she was attacked by assassins sent to kill her spouse. This account differs from the Police Extract identifying cultists as the perpetrators. Moreover, the RPD asked the Appellant about the alleged XXXX 2021 attack and the Appellant testified that his spouse \"...was robbed along the way\" to the vigil.5 The RPD asked the Appellant about pictures of a female in photographs submitted as evidence and he testified, \"That was my wife after she was robbed and taken to the hospital.\"6 There is no reference to a robbery in either the Police Extract or the hospital letter. As well, the Appellant does not mention that his spouse was robbed in his amended narrative but only that she was attacked. On a balance of probabilities, I find the Appellant has failed to establish with credible and trustworthy evidence that his spouse was attacked as alleged in XXXX 2021. It is more likely than not that the Appellant's spouse was injured in a robbery attempt in XXXX 2021 because the inauthentic Police Extract and inconsistencies between the extract, hospital report and the Appellant's testimony do not support the allegation that the assailants initiated the attack to find the Appellant.\nThe RPD did not err in assessing the death of the Appellant's sister\n[21] The Appellant included in his amended narrative that after he departed Nigeria that his younger sister was killed on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, by one of his father's siblings because she too converted to Christianity. The Appellant testified that he knew it was one of his father's siblings because his sister had informed him prior to her death that she was visited on two occasions by their father's siblings and told not to convert. The RPD assigned little weight to the death certificate7 submitted as evidence for the Appellant's sister because it found the document to be fraudulent based on the absence of information and spelling errors when compared to the standard template provided as an example in the NDP.8 I concur with the RPD but find the RPD did not properly identify the absent information. The RPD outlined that the example in the NDP of an authentic death certificate has numbered areas or lines to be filled. The numbered lines or areas for each have a descriptor to inform the individual filling the form of what to enter in that section. For example, \"4. Age of Death\" followed by a line for entering the information. The RPD identified section 4, \"Age of Death,\" being omitted from the submitted death certificate for the Appellant's sister. This is incorrect but the section three (3.) description, \"3. Date of Death,\" is omitted from the submitted death certificate for the Appellant's sister. I do not find this misidentification fatal to the RPD's finding because an essential data point is still absent on the submitted death certificate when compared to the standard sample provided in the NDP.\n[22] The RPD correctly identified that section \"6. Full Address of Usual Place of Residence of Deceased\" in the sample death certificate is listed as \"Full Address of Usual Place of Residential of Deceased\" in the death certificate submitted as evidence. As well, in the sample death certificate a line is provided for a signature with the identifier \"Name of Registrar\" underneath, but the death certificate submitted as evidence provides the identifier as \"Name of Register.\" I concur with the RPD and find the death certificate submitted as evidence to be inauthentic because of an omission and inconsistencies compared to the death certificate sample from the National Population Commission of Nigeria (NPCN) in the documentary evidence.\n[23] In affidavits9 submitted as evidence from the family of the Appellant and his spouse, the affiants provide similarly exact wording concerning the death of the Appellant's sister in two affidavits and very similar wording in a third affidavit despite the affidavits allegedly emanating in each affiant's own words and on different dates. As such, I draw a negative credibility inference concerning the authenticity of the contents in each of the affidavits.\n[24] In the affidavit signed on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the affiant states:\nThat I am a younger sister to XXXX XXXX the mother of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX is always threatened that she changed to Christian by the members of their father family, and XXXX XXXX was traced on her way from Portharcourt to Lagos, she was attacked and killed along Lagos Ibadan Expressway, and we found her corpse on XXXX XXXX 2019 along Lagos Ibadan Expressway.10\nIn the affidavit of XXXX XXXX, 2019, the affiant states:\nThat I am a younger brother to XXXX XXXX the mother of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX is always threatened that she changed to Christian by the members of their father family, and XXXX XXXX was traced on her way from Portharcourt to Lagos, she was attacked and killed along Lagos Ibadan Expressway, and we found her corpse on XXXX XXXX 2019 along Lagos Ibadan Expressway.11\nIn the affidavit of XXXX XXXX, 2019, the affiant states:\nThat my sister XXXX XXXX is been threatened that she change to Christian and she was constantly harassed and she was traced and kidnapped on her way traveling from Portharcourt to Lagos, that she was traced to Lagos Ibadan Expressway on XXXX XXXX 2019 and we later find her Corpse on XXXX XXXX 2019.12\nIt is more likely than not that three affidavits, signed on different dates, would contain wording unique to each of the affiants in describing the incident involving the Appellant's sister. Each of the affidavits also contains exact wording in describing the Appellant's issues with his family including the damage that was done to his property as well as naming the agents of harm and stating, \"That these family members are politicians and influential and strongly people in Nigeria.\" As such, I draw a negative credibility inference regarding the authenticity of the contents of the affidavits in corroborating the allegation that the Appellant's sister was killed by the agents of harm because the affidavits appear to be coordinated by a single author. It is unclear why the affidavits would reference the agents of harm and state that they are politicians and strong people \"in Nigeria\" when the affidavits were allegedly sworn in Nigeria where this information would have been known and identification of their general location at the state level unnecessary. Moreover, it is unclear why the sister of the Appellant's spouse would produce an affidavit the day following her sister being found deceased for record purposes. On a balance of probabilities, I find the affidavits to lack credibility and thus find they do not provide independent corroboration of the allegation that the Appellant's sister died as alleged. It is more likely than not that these affidavits, based on the preceding assessment, were authored at dates later than indicated to bolster the Appellant's claim.\nThe RPD did not err in assessing IFA\n[25] The RPD identified Abuja, Nigeria as a possible IFA location and found Abuja to be viable as an IFA after consideration of the Appellant's circumstances. I concur with the RPD based on the reasons that follow.\n[26] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Rasaratnam:13\n(1) The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.14\n[27] In order to find that an appellant has an IFA both prongs must be satisfied. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the appellants to show that they do not have an IFA.\n[28] The finding of an IFA must be based on a distinct evaluation of the region for that purpose, considering the appellants' personal circumstances. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option. The appellant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or undergo undue hardship in travelling there and staying there. The Federal Court of Appeal has set a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test: \"It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\"15\nThe agents of persecution do not have the motivation or means to locate the Appellant\n[29] The RPD found the agents of persecution do not have the motivation to locate the Appellant in the proposed IFA location because the incidents involving the attack on the Appellant's spouse and the death of his sister occurred because their locations were known to the agents of persecution. As discussed previously, I find the Appellant has failed to provide credible and trustworthy evidence to corroborate the allegations concerning his spouse and sister, on a balance of probabilities. I find the agents of persecution have not demonstrated ongoing interest in the Appellant, on a balance of probabilities.\n[30] The Federal Court found that the absence of evidence alleging the agents of harm have made any efforts to \"contact, find, threaten or extort money from\" a claimant (whether directly, through a business or through their family or acquaintances) can reasonably support a finding that they lack any ongoing interest in pursuing that person.16 There is insufficient evidence on the record to conclude that the agents of persecution have contacted the Appellant or his family members since his departure from Nigeria. In the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) form he lists Ibadan, Nigeria as the location where his spouse, six children and two siblings reside.17 The Appellant resided in Ibadan from 2002 to 2016 according to information provided in his Schedule A form.18 The RPD asked the Appellant if his family members had any problems with the agents of persecution since he departed Nigeria in 2016 and he testified only to the allegation regarding his sister's death in XXXX 2019. On a balance of probabilities, I do not find the agents of persecution have the motivation to locate the Appellant in the proposed IFA location because neither he nor his family members have been contacted following his departure from Nigeria in 2016. I find the agents of persecution have not demonstrated ongoing interest in the Appellant, on a balance of probabilities.\n[31] The Appellant's alleged fear emanates from his conversion to Christianity and his extended family disbelieving he was worthy of his inheritance because of his conversion. The Appellant placed considerable importance on inheritance motivating the agents of harm in a 2018 affidavit submitted as evidence.19 The Appellant states in the affidavit that the agents of persecution \"...were displeased with my change of faith and resolved to deny me of my right to my father's heritage as a result... This declaration is to express my fear due to the immense threat to my life and properties by my paternal aunts and uncles over inheritance of my late father's estate.\"20 The Appellant testified that following his departure that his father's businesses and properties were possessed by his extended family members, the agents of persecution.21 \"Everything, every single thing is in their hands.\"22 On a balance of probabilities, the incidents experienced by the Appellant, which led to his departure from Nigeria, were more attributable to the agents of persecution seeking to possess his father's assets because following his departure there is insufficient evidence on the record to conclude that the agents of persecution maintained ongoing interest in him. As such, it is more likely than not that the agents of persecution's interest in the Appellant abated once they possessed his inheritance of properties and businesses. I find the agents of persecution do not have the motivation to locate the Appellant in the proposed IFA location, on a balance of probabilities.\n[32] I also find there is insufficient evidence on the record to conclude the agents of persecution have the means to locate the Appellant in the proposed IFA location. Counsel argues the RPD erred because it failed to consider the political influence and reach of the agents of persecution and the Appellant's former Nigerian lawyer now holding prominent political influence in the APC. Counsel contends that the former Nigerian lawyer is working in conjunction with the agents of persecution and together with the agents of persecution possess considerable power and resources to locate the Appellant in the proposed IFA location. I disagree because the RPD considered the political power and influence of both the agents of persecution and the Appellant's former Nigerian lawyer.\n[33] The RPD found the Appellant did not provide objective evidence that the agents of persecution, his father's siblings, are powerful individuals with resources and political influence to locate him in the proposed IFA location. It is more likely than not that if the Appellant's extended family had power and political influence within the APC, as alleged, and sufficient enough to locate him in the proposed IFA location that there would be documentary evidence of their political affiliations or influence because documentary evidence was submitted concerning the political affiliation and influence of the Appellant's former Nigerian lawyer in the APC.\n[34] The RPD assessed the Appellant's testimony that his former Nigerian lawyer began working for the agents of persecution in effectively joining forces and possessed considerable influence throughout the country. The RPD acknowledged the documentary evidence outlining the Appellant's former Nigerian lawyer's political activities and influence within the APC but gave little weight to the evidence in corroborating a connection between him and the agents of persecution. I concur with the RPD. While I find credible that the agents of harm threatened the Appellant's former Nigerian lawyer in 2016, and his representation thereafter of the agents of harm, I am not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that this representation continued. The Appellant provided an affidavit sworn before his former Nigerian lawyer in 2018 that outlines allegations against the agents of harm. If the Appellant's former Nigerian lawyer was precluded from continuing his association with the Appellant following threats and being retained by the agents of persecution, the Appellant's former Nigerian lawyer would not have witnessed the Appellant's 2018 affidavit if he was still retained by the agents of persecution, on a balance of probabilities. I find there is insufficient evidence on the record to conclude the Appellant's former lawyer would act in concert with the agents of persecution to locate him in the IFA location. I find the agents of harm do not have the means required to locate the Appellant in the proposed IFA location, on a balance of probabilities. As well, having found the agents of persecution do not have the motivation to locate the Appellant in the proposed IFA location, any means that may be possessed to initiate a search would not be employed, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe IFA location is not unreasonable in the Appellant's circumstances\n[35] I find the Appellant has not met the burden of demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities, that the proposed IFA locations are unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to him, for him to seek refuge there. I find the RPD did not err in the assessment of the second prong of the IFA test.\n[36] The RPD asked the Appellant if there was any reason why he could not live in Abuja and he testified, \"The reason I cannot live in Abuja safely is because my persecutors, they have power all over Nigeria, and in Abuja too there is a rift or a fight or unlikeness to Christians, not too long ago a young woman was stoned to death.\"23 The RPD noted in its decision that the Appellant did not raise issues with respect to his freedom to practise Christianity in Abuja. The RPD found that the documentary evidence in the NDP states that Christians and Muslims reside in approximately equal numbers in the central region of Nigeria where Abuja is located. The RPD found the Appellant could reasonably be expected to find a Christian community in Abuja where he could practise Christianity and receive support in doing so. I concur with the RPD. The RPD also noted that the Appellant provided letters of support from a pastor in Nigeria and from a pastor in Toronto, with the pastor in Toronto being introduced to him through a third pastor in Nigeria. The RPD found it could reasonably be believed based on this evidence that the Appellant could receive spiritual and moral support from pastors in Nigeria. I concur with the RPD.\n[37] Counsel argues the RPD erred by failing to consider that the Appellant has a Muslim name and would be readily identified in Abuja as a convert. There is insufficient evidence on the record to conclude that converts are sought by practitioners of their former religion in Abuja. The documentary evidence outlines indiscriminate attacks by Boko Haram against Christians in general in large urban centres, including Abuja.24 I do not find this evidence particular to the Appellant in his circumstances such that he would be personally targeted, on a balance of probabilities.\n[38] The RPD considered language in the proposed IFA location and found the Appellant would not face undue hardship because his stated language skills are English and Yoruba. The RPD noted from the documentary evidence that English is the official language of Nigeria and Yoruba is one of five major languages in the country. I agree with the RPD that language in the proposed IFA location would not result in undue hardship for the Appellant, on a balance of probabilities.\n[39] The RPD considered the Appellant's age, level of XXXX XXXX XXXX education, and employment history. The RPD noted that the Appellant was employed as a XXXX XXXX in Nigeria and in Canada he was employed in XXXX XXXX and in a XXXX. The RPD found there was insufficient evidence on the record to conclude that the Appellant would be at a greater disadvantage of finding employment in Abuja than similarly situated individuals given his education level and considerable work experience. I concur with the RPD for the same reasons and find the Appellant to be well-situated to support himself financially in the proposed IFA location, on a balance of probabilities.\n[40] The RPD found the Appellant would be able to find treatment and medication in the proposed IFA location for XXXX XXXX based on documentary evidence from the World Health Organization indicating tenofovir as one of the recommended treatments and that XXXX is widely available in urban centres in Nigeria. The Appellant has not raised the issue of treatment availability on appeal. I concur with the RPD's unchallenged finding that it is more likely than not that the Appellant would have access to medical treatment in the proposed IFA location.\n[41] I find the Appellant has not met the burden of demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities, that the proposed IFA location is unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to him, for him to seek refuge there. I find the RPD did not err in the assessment of the second prong of the IFA test. I find the Appellant has a viable IFA in Abuja, Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAaron Smith\nAaron David Smith\nApril 17 ,2023\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The couple fell in love and kept their relationship a secret. The Appellant travelled overseas and returned with a gift of perfume for his girlfriend, which was discovered by her brother. After \"P\" admitted to the relationship, her brother and his friends attacked the Appellant. He went into hiding and received death threats and the police visited the Appellant's family home.\n[5] Subsequently, the Appellant went into hiding and secured a Canadian Visitor Visa with the assistance of an agent. He arrived in Canada in April of 2019 and made a claim for protection. The Appellant fears he would be the victim of an honour killing should he return to India.\n[6] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellant's claim on the basis that he has access to a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Delhi.\n[7] The Appellant submits the following:\na) The RPD erred in finding that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Delhi.4\nNew Evidence\n[8] The Appellant submitted six pieces of new evidence. They are as follows:\n1) Undated statement from the Appellant;5\n2) A notarized letter from XXXX XXXX, the Appellant's brother dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;6\n3) A notarized letter from XXXX XXXX, the Appellant's father, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;7\n4) Two undated photographs at a political event;8\n5) A Punjab Referendum Khalistan Voter Registration Card;9 and\n6) Two undated photographs with police.10\n[9] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA provides that Appellants \"...may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\"\n[10] The second step in the analysis for new evidence, if one of the requirements in s. 110(4) is met, is to consider it in relation to the adapted Raza11 factors endorsed in Singh.12 In Singh, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) held that the RAD should assess the admissibility of the new evidence for its credibility, relevance, and newness.\n[11] In relation to item 1, which is an undated statement from the Appellant, I will accept that this document was written post-rejection and contains some information that could not have reasonably been expected at the time of rejection, as the events detailed in paragraph two allegedly occurred in XXXX of 2022. Paragraph one of the statement details information about the Appellant's former interpreter and how he was instructed to provide allegations regarding his brother at the time of his hearing.\n[12] I have reviewed the transcript in this matter, and I find that the Appellant did make amendments in relation to his brother's location at the time of his hearing. He was also asked if his narrative and amendments were interpreted to him. He confirmed there were some mistakes made, they were corrected, and the documents were translated to him.13 He was asked if there were any other corrections or changes which he hadn't had a chance to make. The Appellant replied, \"that is all.\"14\n[13] The second paragraph deals with allegations about the Appellant's political involvement and his father's arrest. The Appellant amended his documents at the hearing to reflect his relationship with his brother and that he lived in the United States. At no time did the Appellant attempt to establish why his brother was living in the United States or connect his own fears to his brother's political profile. The Appellant clearly provided amendments for information that had been omitted at the time of the hearing, correcting the misguidance from the first interpreter. While the allegations regarding the interpreter are troubling, I note that the Appellant was represented by counsel at his hearing for refugee protection, yet there were no amendments made, or questions asked attempting to remedy the misdirection that the Appellant now alleges regarding his brother's profile.\n[14] While this item may contain information that meets the first prong of the jurisprudential test, I find that the information contained has been supplied to complete a deficient record submitted to the RPD. This is not the purpose of 110(4), which allows for the correction of errors of fact, errors in law or mixed errors of fact and law. I find that this evidence does not meet the test set out in Raza, as it is not credible considering the source and the circumstances in which it came into existence. The Appellant had ample opportunity through amendments and testimony at the hearing to provide evidence about his brother's political profile, and how it intertwined with his allegations of fear. Furthermore, the Appellant has not met his onus of establishing when he became politically active in Canada and whether this evidence arose after the rejection of his refugee claim and that the information is new. The evidence is therefore rejected.\n[15] Items 2 and 3 are notarized letters from the Appellant's brother and father. While these letters are dated post-rejection on XXXX XXXX, 2022, there are no submissions on why this evidence was not reasonably available at an earlier date. The Appellant's brother writes about how he was politically active in India and had issues with the police and there is no explanation why this document was not sought by the Appellant prior to the rejection of his claim. The Appellant's father details his eldest son XXXX experiences in India prior to the Appellant's departure, but again there is no explanation as to why this information was not provided prior to the rejection of the claim.\n[16] As for the new allegations relating to the Appellant's brother and their father, again I do not consider this document credible as it relates to source and circumstance. The Appellant failed to connect his brother's political activity to his own risk before the rejection of his claim. While there are parts of these documents that meet the test under 110(4), I do not find that they are credible and reject them as new evidence.\n[17] Items 4, 5 and 6 are all undated documents. Item 4 is two photographs of men standing in front of a tent which reads \"XXXX\" item 5 is a voter registration card, and item 6 is two photos of a man in a handcuff with what appear to be police. The Appellant makes no submissions on how these documents meet the test in section 110(4) and does not argue why these items were unavailable for submission to the RPD.\n[18] If the Appellant had omitted evidence in his narrative around his brother's political activity and how it influenced his fear from the agents of persecution, he could reasonably have been expected to present this allegation to the RPD. The Appellant has not provided an explanation for why he failed to provide this information to the panel at the time of his hearing. For example, the panel asked the Appellant: \"...before I hand it over to your counsel is there anything you feel like (sic) missed that you would like me to know about your refuge claim?\" The Appellant replied, \"there is nothing that I would like to add.\"15\n[19] Even if these documents could pass the test in section 110(4), the Appellant has again failed to establish how these items are credible considering their source and circumstance. The Appellant at no time, before the rejection of his claim, connected his own fears to his brother's profile or his own political activity that has now led to the alleged arrest of his father. The Appellant was duly represented and could have provided evidence at the time of the hearing, even if this allegation was not included in his narrative or subsequent amendments. He did not do so. I do not find that this evidence is credible or new, and I find its purpose is to remedy a deficient RPD record. I therefore reject these documents as new evidence.\n[20] As I have not accepted any new documents into evidence, I do not have the jurisdiction to hold an oral hearing under section 110(6).\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[21] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.16 The RPD found that the Appellant failed to establish that the agents of persecution would be able to or, are motivated to find him. The RPD found insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellant would face undue hardship in the proposed IFA.\n[22] Having reviewed all the evidence in the case, I find that the Appellant has failed to establish that he does not have a viable IFA in Delhi.\nANALYSIS OF MERITS OF APPEAL\n[23] The Appellant has provided a memorandum which reiterates his submissions at the hearing; however, it fails to provide arguments about errors found in the RPD analysis. There are no references to objective documentary evidence supporting the Appellant's position. A single hyperlink is provided regarding the tenant verification system; however, no submissions have been made to enter this article as new evidence for the purpose of his appeal and the issue of tenant verification was a live issue at the RPD hearing.\n[24] The Appellant has also provided statements regarding new allegations that are contained in the accompanying proposed new evidence in his memorandum; these documents have been dealt with in my analysis regarding the new evidence.\n[25] I have conducted an independent review of the transcript of the RPD hearing,17 as well as the Record. The RPD's reasons are detailed and complete, they accurately reflect the testimony on the Record, and they are clear. I find that the reasons are correct.\nAppellant has a viable IFA in Delhi\n[26] At the outset of the hearing, the RPD identified IFA as a potential issue and the locations of Delhi and Mumbai were noted. The RPD Member found that IFA was the determinative issue and rejected the Appellant's claim for refugee protection based on the availability of a viable IFA in Delhi. I am not persuaded that the RPD erred in its IFA finding.\n[27] After an independent review of the Record and the transcript of the RPD hearing, I also find that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Delhi. I have considered the totality of the evidence and find that there is not a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellant in the IFA location, nor is it unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to the proposed location.\n[28] In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, I have considered the two-prong test from Thirunavukkarasu.18 I must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the Appellant being persecuted in the part of the country in which an IFA exists. Furthermore, conditions in that part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellant, to seek refuge there. The Appellant bears the burden of proof to show that he would be persecuted under one of the Convention grounds, or be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of India, and specifically in the potential IFA location of Delhi. I find that the Appellant has not met this burden.\n[29] International refugee protection is surrogate (that is, substitute) protection that only comes into play if an Appellant does not have an IFA in their country of citizenship. The onus is on the Appellant to demonstrate that he does not have a viable IFA in his home country. In other words, a location to which they could relocate where they could live without experiencing persecution or the kind of serious harm that would make them persons in need of protection. The IFA analysis contains two prongs:19\n1) The decision maker must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Appellants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA location or a likelihood that they would be subjected personally to one of the types of harm that would make them persons in need of protection there.\n2) The conditions in the part of the country under consideration must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the Appellants to seek refuge there. The threshold for unreasonableness is a very high one and requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of an Appellant.20\nCONCLUSION\n[30] The RPD provides a thorough analysis of the relevant issues surrounding the issue of Internal Flight Alternative. The panel addressed each of the Appellant's arguments in their decision and clearly expressed why each prong of the IFA test has been met. I adopt the reasons of the RPD and dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nKimberley Foreman\nKimberley Foreman\nFebruary 16, 2023\nDate\n1 RPD Record, Exhibit 2.1, pp. 16-22, 24-27.\n2 Ibid., pp. 22-24.\n3 Ibid., Exhibits 2.2, 2.3, pp. 28-29.\n4 Appellant Record, p. 16.\n5 Ibid., p. 19.\n6 Ibid., pp. 20-21.\n7 Ibid., pp. 22-25.\n8 Ibid., pp. 26-27.\n9 Ibid., p. 28.\n10 Ibid, p. 29.\n11 Raza, Syed Masood v.

They are appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated July 19, 2022, dismissing their claims for protection. The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in assessing their claims, and they ask the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow their appeals and determine that they are Convention1 refugees or persons in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),2 or to send the matter back to the RPD for redetermination.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Principal Appellant and his wife, the Associate Appellant, are from XXXX in the state of Haryana. They fear harm at the hands of XXXX XXXX (A.K.), a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in their village, because the Principal Appellant was a member of the Indian National Lok Dahl (INLD) party. In addition, the Appellants allege that they fear A.K. because of a dispute regarding agricultural land owned by the Principal Appellant and his family.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are not Convention refugees, and they are not persons in need of protection, in that their removal to India would not subject them personally to a risk to their lives, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\nTHE ROLE OF THE RAD\n[4] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.3 In doing so, I have carried out my own independent analysis of the RPD Record, including the RPD's reasons and decision and the transcript of the RPD hearing, to determine whether the RPD erred.\n[5] The RPD hearing was June 7, 2022 while the decision is dated July 19, 2022. The National Documentation Package (NDP) was updated on June 30, 2022. The Appellant's Record is dated September 9, 2022. Hence, the RAD assumes that the Appellant was aware of the updated NDP.4\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The Appellant does not request new evidence be admitted in this appeal. Owing to the fact that no new evidence has been admitted, I have no authority to hold a hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The RPD found that the determinative issue was the availability of an internal flight alternative (IFA) in New Delhi.\n[8] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred by:\n(a) making unreasonable negative credibility inferences; and\n(b) failing to properly assess the risk the Appellants would face on relocating to the proposed IFA.\n[9] I will assess the RPD's credibility findings in the context of Prong One of the IFA test. My assessment of the viability of an IFA for the Appellants will address their issue as to whether the RPD erred in failing to properly assess the risk they would face on relocating to New Delhi.\nWhether the RPD erred in finding that the Appellants have a viable IFA in New Delhi\n[10] Under the test, both prongs must be met once an IFA has been identified. The burden of proof is on the Appellants to establish that there is no IFA. In assessing an IFA, the Appellants' circumstances and profile must be taken into consideration. For the second prong, the Appellants must overcome a very high threshold to demonstrate that the IFA location is unreasonable by providing evidence that the Appellants' life and safety would be jeopardized by relocating to the proposed location.5 The Federal Court of Appeal has stated:\nWe read the decision of Linden J.A. for this Court as setting up a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.6\nWhether the RPD erred in finding that there was No Serious Risk of Harm under the First Prong of the Test\n[11] The first prong of the IFA test states that there must be a finding that there is no serious possibility that the Appellants will be persecuted in the proposed IFA or that the Appellants will not be personally subject to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, believed on substantial grounds to exist, in the IFA.\nRPD's findings\n[12] The RPD found that A.K. would not have the motivation to locate the Appellants in New Delhi because of the Principal Appellant's support for the INLD or the land dispute.\n[13] With respect to A.K.'s interest in the Appellants concerning their political affiliation with INLD, the RPD made a number of credibility findings.\n[14] First, the RPD inquired as whether the Principal Appellant was arrested when A.K. filed a First Information Report (FIR) against both him and his father. The Principal Appellant testified that, while his father was arrested, he was not because he was in hiding. The RPD drew a negative credibility inference because the address history in his immigration forms do not indicate he was in hiding.\n[15] Second, the RPD made a negative credibility inference because it asked why his father was acquitted of assault of A.K. and he answered because the court decided who was right and who was wrong. However, the RPD noted that the court decision read that A.K. could not identify who assaulted him. The RPD also drew another negative credibility inference because of the Principal Appellant's evolving testimony as he then testified that A.K. was pressured to withdraw the court case.\n[16] Third, the RPD drew a negative credibility inference owing to his evasive testimony by the Principal Appellant as to whether A.K. is searching for him.\n[17] The RPD drew a negative credibility inference concerning whether A.K. continues to pursue him because of his affiliation with INLD when he has been out of the country for a number of years, and the Principal Appellant responded that A.K. will pursue him because of a land dispute.\n[18] The RPD also found that the Appellants have not established that A.K. would pursue them in the proposed IFA owing to the land dispute. The RPD found that the Principal Appellant provided evasive responses to the issue of why A.K. would pursue the Appellants in New Delhi when his family that co-owns the property remain in the village.\n[19] The RPD noted that neither of two of affidavits from the Principal Appellant's father mention the land dispute. The RPD found that the Appellants provided no evidence of A.K. pursuing them, in particular, from XXXX 2018 to XXXX 2019 when they were in New Delhi.\n[20] The RPD also found that the BJP would not be interested in pursuing the Appellants in New Delhi because when the RPD asked the Principal Appellant why the BJP would be interested, he testified that A.K. is influential in the party. The RPD had already found that A.K. would not be motivated to track the Appellants in Delhi due to their political affiliation.\n[21] The RPD noted that INLD is a Haryana-based party with no presence in Delhi, and that Appellants have not established that they have a profile that would motivate BJP to search for them in New Delhi. It found that there is no evidence the BPJ would target the Appellants because of their support for INLD and minority-like parties.\n[22] The RPD found that the agents of persecution would not be able or have the means to locate Appellants in New Delhi through tenant registration system or the Aadhaar Card.\nAppellants' submissions\n[23] The Appellants submit that there is no discrepancy with respect to the Principal Appellant's testimony concerning his father's court case. They submit that the Principal Appellant's testimony was not evolving. The Principal Appellant's impression about what happened in court was, as the RPD noted, that \"the court looked at the situation and decided who is right and who is wrong\"7 as the court looked at the facts before them and served justice accordingly. The Appellant states that since the complainant did not identify the Appellant's father, there was no evidence based on which to convict, resulting in his father's acquittal. The Appellants state that the Principal Appellant explained that the village council had intervened, pressuring A.K. to drop the false charges against his father and his family. Given that the original FIR filed by A.K. identified the Appellant's father as one of his assailants, the Appellant's testimony provided a consistent and credible explanation as to why A.K. did not testify against his father in court.\n[24] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in finding the Principal Appellant's testimony evasive concerning whether A.K. is inquiring about him. The Appellants state that while the RPD asked when the last time was that A.K. had asked about the Principal Appellant and his response was that the inquiries are on-going. The Appellants state that the RPD never rephrased the question to ask when the \"most recent\" time was that A.K. had asked after the Appellant.\n[25] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in finding that A.K. would not be interested in him owing to his political affiliation with INLD as his father continued to live in the same village as A.K. and also supports INLD. However, the Appellants state that the Principal Appellant is a member of INLD, while his father was not, and he had a higher profile in the INLD. The Appellants also state that A.K. also has a grudge against the Principal Appellant.\n[26] The Appellants state that the RPD erred in not recognizing the Appellants are specially and specifically targeted by A.K. because of a grudge that went above and beyond his family's situation.\n[27] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred by relying on unreasonable credibility findings which affected elements central to their claims and therefore the RPD unreasonably diminished the perception of his forward-facing risk at the hands of A.K. and the BJP. The Appellants submit that this led the RPD to conclude that A.K. was not interested in searching for and harming the Appellants if they relocate to the proposed IFA.\nFindings\n[28] For the reasons below, I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the motivation to locate them in the proposed IFA. In my independent review of the evidence, I also find that the Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the means to locate them in New Delhi. To respond to the Appellants' \"Issue no. 1,\" I find that the RPD's credibility findings are correct with the exception of the finding pertaining to the inconsistency in the Principal Appellant's testimony and dates in their immigration forms. Although I found this specific finding was not correct, I find the RPD's overall findings are correct.\n[29] With respect to the Appellants' \"Issue No. 2,\" for the reasons below, I find that the RPD did not err by failing to properly assess the risk the Appellants would face on relocating to New Delhi.\nAgents of persecution motivation to pursue the Appellants in New Delhi (including Appellants' Issue No. 1 - Credibility findings)\nA.K.'s interest in the Appellant based on his political affiliation\n[30] I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants have not established that A.K. has a continuing interest in pursuing the Principal Appellant because of his political affiliation.\n[31] The Principal Appellant testified that one of the reasons he fears A.K. is because he belongs to the INLD party8 and he further testified that A.K. wants him to quit the party.9 However, the Principal Appellant has been in Canada since XXXX XXXX, 2019 and has not participated in any political activities in Haryana. The RPD asked the Principal Appellant why A.K. would be interested in him owing to the fact he has not worked for the INLD for over three years. The Principal Appellant testified that \"these conflicts are never ending because there is a strong amount of rivalry...\"10 I find that the RPD is correct in finding that the Principal Appellant's testimony is evasive and speculative considering that the Appellants have been out of the country for well-over three years, have not participated in any political activities in the state and have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. wants to continue the alleged \"rivalry\" or \"grudge\" such that he would seek the Appellants throughout India. I address the issue of the land dispute below.\n[32] I find that the RPD is correct in finding that the INLD, is a Haryana-based party and does not have a presence in New Delhi. The Appellants have not explained why A.K. would be motivated to seek them in New Delhi when the very reason he sought the Principal Appellant, that is, for his work on a rival party, would be absent.\n[33] I find that the RPD's negative credibility finding concerning the Appellants' allegation that A.K. wanted to harm them by filing an assault charge during the 2014 elections is correct. I also agree with the RPD that the alleged harm to the Principal Appellant and his father is central to the allegation that A.K. has a continuing interest to harm the Principal Appellant because of his political affiliation. A review of the Appellants' evidence shows that the Principal Appellant's testimony evolved as he was asked questions by the RPD.\n[34] The Principal Appellant testified that A.K. falsely accused his father of assaulting him but, with the assistance of his lawyer, his father was able to prove his innocence11 and that \"ultimately it was the lawyer and the judiciary that took a look at what had gone through and who is right, and who is wrong.\"12 However, the court document submitted by the Appellants stated that A.K. could not identify the persons who assaulted him.13 The RPD then asked why would A.K. withdraw his accusations against his father. The Principal Appellant stated because the village council pressured him to do so. The RPD asked why would A.K., if he is so important, be pressured by the village council, and the Principal Appellant replied that because the elders have to be respected. When asked why would not the village council help resolve the dispute with the Appellants and A.K, the Principal Appellant replied, \"Well, the thing is he just waits for the right chance - to click for him.\"14 I find that the Principal Appellant's testimony evolved by stating their lawyer worked to justify his father's innocence while the court documents indicate that A.K., the agent of persecution, withdrew his accusations against him, and then he added that the withdrawal was owing to pressure from the village council. I find it reasonable that, when asked initially by the RPD, the Principal Appellant would have explained that A.K. withdrew the charges owing to pressure from the village council.\n[35] I find that the RPD's negative credibility finding concerning inquiries as to the last time A.K. inquired about him is correct. Although the RPD made its finding on the basis that the Principal Appellant's testimony was evasive, I also find that Appellants have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. continues to pursue him.\n[36] The RPD asked the Principal Appellant twice in clear terms as to when the last time A.K. inquired about him. The Principal Appellant first replied that A.K. asked about him from 2000 to 2019 and he asks for him even at the present time. When asked again when the last time was, the Principal Appellant replied A.K. keeps asking for him. 15 The RPD asked a direct question and the Principal Appellant replied in a vague, evasive manner. I also note that Appellants' evidence as to the continuing interest by A.K. is similarly vague. The Appellants' amended Basis of Claim (BOC), which was extensively expanded from the Appellants' initial narrative, was submitted on May 30, 2022, a week before the RPD hearing. However, the amended BOC form states that since coming to Canada, A.K. continues to ask his father on a regular basis as to his whereabouts.16 Similarly, one of the affidavits sworn in 2022 submitted by the Principal Appellant's father states that, \"til date,\" members of the BJP ask about him.17 The other affidavit, dated also in 2022, states that A.K. and members of the BJP often inquire about the Principal Appellant and threaten him.18 Neither the Principal Appellant's testimony, despite the direct questions nor any of the documentary evidence, provide a single specific instance as to when A.K. sought out the Appellants since the Appellants have been in Canada. I find that the Principal Appellant's testimony and documentary evidence has a low probative value that A.K. has a continuing interest to seek the Appellants anywhere in India. Even if A.K. makes occasional inquiries, I find that the Appellants have not established he is interested in pursing the Appellants throughout India.\n[37] I do not agree with the Appellants' submission that the Principal Appellant's testimony was consistent owing to the nature of the RPD's questions. I disagree with Appellants' submission that the RPD should have asked the Principal Appellant when the most \"recent\" time A.K. inquired about him occurred. In my review of the transcript, the RPD asked a clear and direct question twice about the \"last\" time there was an inquiry and the Principal Appellant provided an evasive response.\n[38] I also note that there is no evidence that BJP remains interested in him. The RPD asked whether members of BJP \"in any time come to your house?\" The Principal Appellant responded in the negative.19 If A.K. has no interest in pursuing the Appellants throughout India, nor would the BJP be so interested.\n[39] I recognize that the RPD made a negative credibility inference concerning the inconsistency of the Principal Appellant's testimony and his immigration forms. The Principal Appellant testified that he was in hiding when his father was arrested yet his immigration forms do not reflect this testimony.20 The Appellants' counsel at the RPD hearing noted that the forms were never translated to the Appellants and they are unaware of the contents of the documents.21 The RPD asked why the Appellants would sign immigration forms that they did not know the contents and then asked questions pertaining to various dates in the forms that differ from the Principal Appellant's testimony, including his testimony that he started working for XXXX at age 11 in 2000 and owned his XXXX XXXX two years later.22 However, the RPD did not make express findings with respect to these latter issues. I accept that the Appellants signed documents unaware of the contents of those documents and I do not make a negative credibility inference concerning the dates when they were in hiding. Although I found the RPD to be incorrect with respect to this particular finding, I find that the RPD was correct in its overall findings that A.K. does not have the motivation to pursue the Appellants should they return to India.\nA.K.'s interest in the Appellant due to the land dispute\n[40] I find the RPD is correct in finding that the Appellants have not established that A.K. has an interest in pursuing the Appellants owing to the land dispute, and more particularly, the dispute concerning A.K.'s control of drains that allow waters to flood the agricultural lands that the Principal Appellant co-owns with his father and brother.\n[41] The Appellants' BOC notes that the threats from A.K. were because of the Principal Appellant's family's complaints from the flooding from A.K.'s land.23 However, the Appellants have been in Canada since XXXX 2019, and have not made any complaints or even communicated with A.K. since they left India.\n[42] I find that the RPD is correct in finding the Principal Appellant's testimony to be evasive as to why A.K. would continue to search for him in New Delhi. The Principal Appellant testified that he was still a target by A.K. and he explained that the dispute continues because he co-owns the land with his brother and father.24 When the RPD asked why would A.K. have any interest in him considering that he has been away for three years and made no complaints concerning the land, the Principal Appellant testified that there remains a strong amount of rivalry.25 The Principal Appellant's response is not reasonable that he remains the target because his father remains a strong supporter of INLD, and as noted, the Principal Appellant has not complained about the land or has been involved in local politics for over three years. Moreover, it is not reasonable that A.K. focusses on the Principal Appellant as the target when the other co-owners, the father and brother, remain in the same village.\n[43] The Appellants acknowledge that the land dispute is not at the core of A.K.'s interest in pursuing the Appellants, but an on-going grudge or rivalry. In their Legal Memorandum, the Appellants state:\n...that he is likely no longer being targeted by XXXX XXXX specifically because of their prior land dispute. When asked why he would still be targeted because of the land dispute when his father and brothers were co-owners of the land and still present in the village, the Appellant clarified that he was still being targeted because of the grudge that grew from both the land dispute and his political inclinations, which went above and beyond his family's.26\n[44] I have already found that the Appellants have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. wants to pursue a rivalry or grudge such that he willing to pursue them across the India although they have not participated in any political activity in the state or made complaints about the land dispute in over three years.\n[45] The RPD correctly noted that neither of the affidavits from the Principal Appellant's father mention that A.K. is inquiring about the Principal Appellant pertaining to the land dispute.27\n[46] Further, while the Principal Appellant states that A.K. continues to pursue him because he is the co-owner of the land, the Principal Appellant could relinquish his property rights in order to avoid the dispute. Courts have established that property rights claims, although well-founded, are not a basis for a refugee claim. The Courts have said that claimants may have to make reasonable choices to free themselves of a risk of harm, and they must be expected to pursue those options.28 The Courts have said that this principle is applicable to both risks under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.29\n[47] I find that the Appellants have not established with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. has a continuing interest in the Principal Appellant concerning the land dispute. The Principal Appellants could also make reasonable choices to free themselves of a risk of harm by relinquishing his interest in the land that he co-owns to further reduce or avoid any conflict with A.K.\n[48] In summary, I find that the Appellants have not established with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. retains a continuing interest to pursue the Appellants either because of the Principal Appellant's affiliation with INLD or because of his interest in a land dispute. Although the Principal Appellant offered the allegation that it was a rivalry or a grudge that motivates A.K., there is no insufficient evidence to establish the basis for this allegation.30 I find that the RPD is correct in finding that there is no evidence concerning any efforts by A.K. to inquire about the Appellants outside of their village. Even if A.K. asks his father occasionally, there is no evidence about either A.K. or members of the BJP searching for the Appellants outside their village or the state of Haryana.\nWhether the agents of persecution have the means to pursue the Appellants in New Delhi (including the Appellants' Issue No. 2 - whether the RPD erred by failing to properly assess the risk the Appellant would face on relocating to New Delhi\nRPD's findings\n[49] The RPD found that the agents of persecution do not have the means to locate the Appellants through their use of the Aadhaar Card or the tenant verification system.\n[50] The RPD found that the Appellants would not be in hiding as the agents of persecution have not threatened violence against them or their families.\nAppellants' submissions\n[51] The Appellants state that the RPD erred in finding that the BJP does not have the means or connection to pursue the Appellants in the proposed IFA because although the BJP is not the ruling party in Delhi, it is a national ruling party in India and has a large membership and influence across the country. The Appellants submit that the RPD failed to consider the BJP's true scope and influence.\n[52] The Appellants state that the RPD erred in finding that the agents of persecution would not trace him through family members, acquaintances or social community. The Appellants state that A.K. swore a false FIR against his family, where he claimed the Principal Appellant's father, uncle and cousin assaulted him, with his father being arrested, and thus has shown a willingness to harm the Principal Appellant's family and it does not matter that no harm has come to his family since they have been in Canada.\nFindings\n[53] The Appellants did not provide specific submissions with respect to whether the agents of persecution have the means to locate them, except to state that the RPD erred by not considering the influence of the BJP across the country. The Appellants have not provided any specific evidence of the influence, means or capacity of the BJP to locate persons throughout India. I have already found that the Appellants have not established that the BJP has the motivation or the interest to pursue the Appellants in New Delhi.\n[54] I find that the Appellants cannot be tracked through the tenant registration system. According to the objective evidence, the tenant registration system is intended to detect whether a person has any criminal record.31 The document indicates that the system is mandatory and the tenant verification programme exists in New Delhi.32 However, according to the same source, the police force is too ill-equipped and short-staffed to actually carry out verifications.33 One source noted that one of the state uses of Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS) is the verification of tenants, but that CCTNS use for this purpose varies widely between states and the police do not make any effort to follow up with the concerned police station of other states.34\n[55] Even if the Appellants' names are checked through the CCTNS, there is no evidence that their names would be found in any of the police databases. Although an FIR was registered against him, the Principal Appellant testified that it was withdrawn and not valid.35 The Appellants provided no evidence that they are persons of interest to the police. Further, the Appellants have not provided credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. has such influence as to be able to work with the police to access the CCTNS.\n[56] I also find that the Appellant cannot be located through the use of the Aadhaar Card. A Response to Information Request researched by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada found in the NDP indicates that, according to the governing legislation, there is no legal access to Aadhaar data in any police database, including the CCTNS.36 I find, based on the information in the NDP, that the Appellants have not established that he can be tracked by obtaining an Aadhaar number.\n[57] I disagree with the Appellant's submission that he would have to remain in hiding in the proposed IFA.\n[58] I agree with the Appellants that the courts have stated that the general principle is that a refugee cannot be expected to live in hiding in order for a proposed IFA to be reasonable and that family members should not be required to place their own lives in danger by refraining to disclose the location of the claimants in the IFA. I find that the circumstances of the present appeal are different than the caselaw cited by the Appellant. In the Ali 37 case, the agents of harm were members of a terrorist group who threatened violence and death against the claimants and their families. I have found that the Appellants have not established with credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. or the BJP have the motivation or means to pursue him. Further, similar to the circumstances in this appeal, the Courts have held that claimants are not in hiding where they have not provided any evidence to suggest that their family would undermine their safety in the IFAs as it is their onus to establish that there is a likelihood of their whereabouts being disclosed to the agents of harm.38 There is no evidence the Appellants' family is required to hide the Appellants' location in order to protect their own safety as there are no threats of violence directed toward the Principal Appellant's father or brother by the agents of persecution. Although there may be occasional inquiries by A.K., the Appellants' relatives have remained in the same village since the time the Appellants travelled to Canada and there is no evidence that they are in danger of withholding information.\n[59] In the circumstances of this appeal, the Appellants are not being asked to hide their location from the family or friends to keep them safe. I agree with the RPD that there is no evidence that the Principal Appellant's father has been harmed or threatened in the hope of having the Appellants' location disclosed. I have already found that the Principal Appellant can relinquish his interest in the land he co-owns with his family to avoid any future issues with A.K, if that remains an issue, and I have found that the Appellants are not a threat or issue of concern for A.K. in New Delhi as INLD is not a party in that state. The Appellants have been out of the country since XXXX 2019 and, according to the Principal Appellant's testimony, A.K. does not know they are in Canada, which demonstrates that no family member has disclosed their location.39\n[60] The Appellants submit that A.K. filed an FIR against the father in 2014 and has subsequently threatened A.K. and his family. However, I note that A.K. withdrew the accusations that formed the basis of the FIR and, as noted, the Principal Appellant's family have remained living in same area as A.K. since that time.\n[61] In my independent review of the evidence, I find that the Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the motivation to locate them in New Delhi owing to either the Principal Appellant's affiliation with the INLD or his interest in the land dispute. I also find that the Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the means to locate them through the CCTNS database, the Aadhaar Card or the tenant registration system.\nDid the RPD err in finding that it was not unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to one of the proposed IFAs under the Second Prong of the Test?\n[62] The RPD found that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to New Delhi. It found that the Appellants speak Hindi. The Principal Appellant has work experience as a XXXX in India and the Associate Appellant has work experience in Canada.\n[63] The Appellant did not provide specific submissions with respect to the second prong of the IFA test.\nFindings on Second Prong of the IFA Test\n[64] Under the second prong, there is a very high threshold requiring actual and concrete evidence of conditions which would jeopardize the life or safety of the Appellants in temporarily relocating to the proposed IFAs.40 I find that the RPD did not err in finding that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to New Delhi.\n[65] I agree with the RPD's finding that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to one of the IFAs. The Appellants have not provided specific submission with respect to this finding.\n[66] The Appellants are Hindu and speak Hindi. According to the objective evidence, over 79 per cent of the population of India are Hindu and some 43 percent of the population speak Hindi.41 There is no evidence that Appellants could not practice their religion or would have issues with language in New Delhi.\n[67] The Principal Appellant worked in agriculture in India and trained as a XXXX. He then XXXX his XXXX XXXX. The Associate Appellant has worked in Canada.\n[68] I have also reviewed the evidentiary record to review the Appellants' personal circumstances and I found no mental health, medical or other circumstance that would make their relocation to India objectively unreasonable.\n[69] After an independent assessment of the evidence, I conclude that the Appellants have a viable IFA in New Delhi. I find that they do not face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, or a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in one of the proposed IFAs. I find that it would not be objectively unreasonable in all of the circumstances for the Appellants to relocate to New Delhi.\nCONCLUSION\n[70] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPaul Muldoon\nPaul Muldoon\nJanuary 16, 2023\nDate\n1 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, sections 96 and 97.\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He left South Africa in XXXX 2018 and made a refugee claim in Canada in August 2018. The Appellant alleges that he fears xenophobic attacks in South Africa. He allegedly fears that, in Nigeria, he will be persecuted by the government because of his membership in and activities with the organization Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and will be harmed by community members from his village because he is a XXXX.\n[2] The Appellant's claim was heard by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on March 10, 2022. On July 23, 2022, the RPD rejected the claim. The determinative issue was exclusion from refugee protection pursuant to section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and Article 1E of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.\n[3] The Minister intervened in writing at the RPD on the issues of identity, credibility, and exclusion under Article 1E. The Minister has not intervened on the appeal.\nDECISION\n[4] I dismiss the appeal. The determinative issue is exclusion under Article 1E. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[5] My role is to look at all the evidence and independently determine whether the RPD made the correct decision.1 This is the general rule. Exceptionally, I may defer to the RPD on a credibility finding where the RPD had a meaningful advantage in assessing and weighing the credibility of the oral evidence. On reviewing the record, I do not find that the RPD had any meaningful advantage. Therefore, the standard of review is correctness.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The RPD found that there was prima facie evidence that Article 1E was engaged and that the burden of proof shifted to the Appellant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he lost his status in South Africa. The panel found that the Appellant did not meet his onus to show that he lost his status in South Africa, therefore, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant had permanent resident status in South Africa on the date of his RPD hearing. The RPD found that he did not establish his allegation that he was the victim of xenophobic attacks in South Africa, on a balance of probabilities. The panel concluded that he was excluded from refugee protection, pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention.\n[7] On an independent assessment, I find that the RPD was correct to conclude that the Appellant is excluded from refugee protection, pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention, and I reach the same conclusion. In the reasons that follow, I explain why I reach this conclusion and I address the Appellant's arguments.\nThe framework of analysis for the issue of exclusion under Article 1E\n[8] The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) has identified RAD decision XXXX XXXX XXXX as a Jurisprudential Guide in applying Article IE of the Refugee Convention.2 The suggested framework of analysis, with which I agree and which I adopt, involves asking the following questions:\n1) At the date of the RPD hearing, did the claimant hold a status in a country of residence that confers on them substantially the same rights and obligations that are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country?\na. If the answer to question 1) is no, the RPD and\/or RAD must consider whether the claimant previously held such a status and lost it or had access to such a status and failed to acquire it. If so, the RPD and the RAD must consider and balance the factors set out by the Court of Appeal in the last part of para. 28 of the Zeng decision. [Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Zeng, 2010 FCA 118 (\"Zeng\") at para. 28.]\nb. If the answer to question 1) is yes, the next question is whether the claimant's country of residence is unsafe for them in the sense that they face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or, the likelihood of being subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment for which they have no state protection or internal flight alternative.\ni) If the claimant's country of residence is unsafe for them, they are not excluded from refugee protection and the decision maker must consider whether they are a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection in respect of their country of nationality.\nii) If the claimant's country of residence is safe for them, they are excluded from refugee protection by the combined effect of Article 1E and s. 98 of the IRPA.3\nThe RPD correctly found that there was prima facie evidence that Article 1E was engaged\n[9] The Appellant acknowledges that he acquired permanent resident status in South Africa.4 He does not challenge the RPD's findings that he had that status when he came to Canada, and that it gave him rights substantially similar to those of nationals of South Africa. I see no error in those findings. On an independent assessment, I reach the same conclusions.\n[10] The RPD found that there was prima facie evidence that Article 1E was engaged, based on the following:\ni. evidence that the Appellant had permanent resident status in South Africa, as demonstrated by his South Africa Permanent Residence Permit, issued 2015XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX5 the Appellant's evidence that he moved to South Africa in 2001;6 and the Appellant's evidence that, when he arrived in Canada, he had permanent resident status in South Africa, given in the immigration forms he completed when he entered Canada7 and in his interview with Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA);8\nii. evidence demonstrating that the Appellant's rights as a permanent resident of South Africa were substantially similar to those of nationals of that country; and\niii. evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, loss of permanent resident status after a three-year absence from South Africa was discretionary, and not automatic.\n[11] The Appellant has not challenged any of these findings. I see no error in them, and I reach the same conclusions.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellant had permanent resident status in South Africa, on a balance of probabilities\n[12] After finding that there was prima facie evidence that Article 1E was engaged, the RPD went on to find as follows:\n* The burden of proof shifted to the Appellant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he lost his status in South Africa.\n* The Appellant did not meet his onus to show that he lost his status in South Africa, therefore, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant had permanent resident status in South Africa on the date of his RPD hearing.\n* The Appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he cannot return to South Africa.\n[13] The Appellant makes the following arguments in respect of these findings:\n* The RPD's finding that insufficient evidence was presented to rebut a prima facie case of exclusion was an unfair appreciation of the evidence.\n* It is very likely or probable that the Appellant lost his permanent resident status in South Africa because of his absence from the country for over three years.\n* The RPD assumed that he had not lost his status and no conclusive, definitive proof was presented to confirm or substantiate this view.\n[14] I do not find the Appellant's arguments persuasive. I find no error in the RPD's assessment of the evidence. On an independent assessment, I reach the same conclusions, for the reasons that follow.\n[15] I do not agree with the Appellant's submission that the RPD assumed he had lost his status. The RPD considered the evidence in the record and gave detailed reasons explaining why that evidence was insufficient to rebut the prima facie case. I do not agree with the Appellant's submission that conclusive, definitive proof was required to confirm that the Appellant had lost his status. The onus was on the Appellant to establish that he had not lost his status, on a balance of probabilities. The RPD applied the correct standard of proof in finding that he did not meet his onus.\n[16] The Appellant does not cite the evidence on which he relies in submitting that it is probable he lost his permanent resident status because of his absence of over three years. I see no error in the RPD's conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to establish this allegation. I find it insufficient, on assessing it independently.\n[17] The Appellant testified that he had automatically lost his permanent resident status in 2021 because he had been away for three years.9 When asked why he believed that it was automatic, he testified that it is on their website and it is the law of South Africa.10 The Appellant was represented by counsel and presented supporting documents but did not present evidence from the website to which he was referring or any evidence of South African law. When the panel member asked him why he did not provide information from the website, he testified that since it is accessible online it could be seen.11 The onus was on the Appellant to establish that he had not lost his status, on a balance of probabilities. The RPD is not required to search for online information to establish a claimant's allegations.\n[18] The Appellant testified that he was told, when he collected his certificate, that if he stayed away for more than three years, he would lose his permanent resident status.12 The Appellant's South Africa Residence Permit states that permanent residents who are absent from the country for three years or longer may lose their right to permanent residence.13 The RPD member asked him to comment on the use of the word \"may\", which indicates that the decision is discretionary. The Appellant replied that, for instance, if he was outside the country with his wife, a South African citizen, and they happened to be working in a South African liaison office in another country, then he would be allowed back because he was away with his wife.14 He testified that, in his circumstances, he would not be allowed to enter South Africa as he is no longer a permanent resident because of being away for more than three years.15\n[19] The RPD member asked the Appellant if he had contacted the South African Embassy to confirm that he was no longer a permanent resident and he testified that he had not.16 When asked why not, he testified that he did not consider going back to South Africa because of what he went through there.17 He testified that, for the same reason, he made no inquiries with any other South African authority nor did his wife make any inquiries on his behalf.18\n[20] Evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nigeria states that withdrawal of a permanent resident permit can take place if the permanent resident is away from the country for more than three years unless exempted.19\n[21] I find the objective evidence in the NDP and on the face of the Appellant's South Africa Residence Permit clear and unambiguous. I find that it establishes that a permanent resident may lose their status if absent for more than three years. In other words, the loss of status is not automatic. The Appellant's belief, that the loss of status is automatic, is at odds with the objective evidence. I find the objective evidence more reliable and trustworthy than the Appellant's belief about South African law. Although the evidence is that the Appellant may have lost his status, he did not adduce any evidence to show that this had actually happened. I find his evidence that he lost his status speculative. The onus was on the Appellant and he did not meet his onus.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellant did not establish that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, or a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in South Africa\n[22] The RPD found that the Appellant did not establish that he would be unsafe in South Africa in the sense that he would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, or a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The Appellant argues that this is wrong and that the RPD erred in finding that he failed to establish that he faces a prospective risk in South Africa. I am not persuaded by the Appellant's arguments. In the following paragraphs, I explain why I find that the RPD's conclusion was correct and why I reach the same conclusion, on assessing the evidence independently.\nThe Appellant did not establish his allegation that he was the victim of xenophobic attacks in South Africa, on a balance of probabilities\n[23] The Appellant alleges that he fears returning to South Africa because he fears being the victim of xenophobic attacks. He alleged that he was repeatedly attacked and, specifically, that he was attacked on XXXX XXXX, 2018 and at the end of XXXX 2018. He further alleged that his XXXX partner was killed in a xenophobic attack in XXXX, 2018. The RPD found that he did not establish the three attacks that he specified or that he was the victim of repeated attacks. The Appellant argues that the objective evidence supports his claim and that his testimony benefits from the presumption of truth and that, therefore, it establishes his allegations. I am not persuaded by the Appellant's arguments. On an independent assessment, I find that the RPD did not err and the Appellant has not established the attacks alleged or that he was the victim of xenophobic attacks, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe alleged attack on the Appellant on XXXX XXXX, 2018\n[24] The Appellant alleged that, on XXXX XXXX, 2018, he was the victim of a xenophobic attack at his XXXX XXXX, that he was robbed, stabbed, and left to die. The evidence in his Basis of Claim (BOC) was that he woke up in a pool of blood, recovered with the aid of modern medicine, and is still surprised that he escaped alive.20 The RPD found that he did not establish the attack, on a balance of probabilities. The panel found that the Appellant's evidence about whether he sought medical treatment was equivocal and evolving and he did not reasonably explain why he did not provide a medical report. I find no error in this. I reach the same conclusion.\n[25] I find that the Appellant equivocated about whether he sought medical treatment and that his testimony was confusing and evolving. The Appellant testified as follows. When he was asked why he did not get a medical report, he testified that, at the time, he was just concerned about treating himself so he didn't get a medical report because he knew that the police would not help him so he decided to just treat himself and get better.21 The RPD member asked him to clarify whether he sought medical treatment and he testified that he sought medical treatment, but he did not go for a medical report, he treated himself obviously.22 In response to the member's comment that this was confusing, the Appellant testified that he decided to treat himself and get better.23 When the member then asked him whether he treated himself or went to a doctor or a hospital or a clinic, the Appellant testified that he was taken to the hospital.24\n[26] I find that the Appellant did not reasonably explain his failure to provide a medical report. When the RPD member asked him why he did not get a report from the hospital, he testified that, at the time, he had no intention of going further with what happened because it was something that was happening repeatedly and he was just concerned that he was alive and he left it that way.25 I do not find that this explains his lack of effort to obtain a medical report for the RPD. The Appellant was represented by counsel and presented other supporting documents, including medical reports from Nigeria pertaining to his father. Rule 11 of the RPD Rules requires that a claimant provide acceptable documents establishing their identity and other elements of the claim.26 A claimant who fails to do so must explain why and what steps they took to obtain documents.\n[27] The RPD member asked the Appellant why he did not ask his wife in South Africa to get the report for him to use in support of his claim. The Appellant's response was that he did not think she would be able to get the information because he went to treat himself.27 The RPD member asked him to clarify, again, whether he went to a hospital. His testimony was that he went to the hospital, was treated the same day, and he was discharged the next day.28 When asked why his wife did not get a report from the hospital for him, the Appellant testified that he did not request it.29 His explanation for not requesting it was that since he was in Canada he did not go and make such requests.30 He testified that he felt that since it was something that happened when he was in South Africa and he just left everything, he would just forget what happened to him in South Africa.31 I do not find this a reasonable explanation.\n[28] There is no general requirement that a claimant provide corroborating documents.32 This proposition is generally regarded as a corollary of the presumption of truthfulness, established by Maldonado.33 However, the Federal Court has said that a failure to provide corroborative evidence may be reasonably considered as going to credibility where there are other valid reasons to doubt a claimant's credibility, or where such evidence would be reasonably expected to be available and the claimant does not reasonably explain its absence.34 In this case, I find that, on either one of these grounds, the Appellant's failure to provide corroborative evidence undermines his credibility. His equivocal and evolving testimony about whether he sought medical treatment raises credibility concerns. I also find that it would be reasonable to expect that the Appellant could have obtained a medical report from the hospital in South Africa, either by contacting them directly or by authorizing his wife in South Africa to get medical records from the hospital. I do not find that his explanation, that he wanted to forget about what happened to him in South Africa, reasonably explains why he made no attempt to get a medical report to corroborate his evidence that he was stabbed and left to die by his assailants. I find that the Appellant failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he was attacked on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, as alleged.\nThe alleged attack on the Appellant in XXXX 2018\n[29] The CBSA interview notes indicate that, when asked if he had ever been a victim of violence, the Appellant stated that he had been attacked at the end of XXXX 2018 during an attempted robbery at his shop and has a scar on his left elbow from where he was cut with a bottle.35 The RPD member asked him why he did not mention this attack in his BOC. The Appellant testified that in his story he just put everything together and he did not think of mentioning it separately.36 The RPD found that the Appellant's explanation for the omission of this evidence from his BOC would be credible, if he had presented corroborative evidence of the attack, such as a medical report. His testimony was that he did not get a medical report to corroborate this allegation because he just wanted to forget about everything that happened in South Africa.37 On an independent assessment, I find that the RPD was correct to conclude that the Appellant has not reasonably explained the omission of the XXXX 2018 attack from his BOC.\n[30] In his BOC, he alleged that he suffered repeated xenophobic attacks and gave particulars of an attack allegedly occurring on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.38 He gave no particulars regarding any other attacks in South Africa. The Appellant's BOC was prepared with the assistance of counsel.39 Prior to the hearing, at which he was represented by counsel, the Appellant provided an amended version of his narrative.40 The amended narrative included additional details, such as dates, for events alleged to have occurred in Nigeria, in 2016 and 2017. The Appellant confirmed at the outset of the hearing that his amended narrative was complete, true, and correct and he had no changes to make.41 The CBSA interview notes were disclosed to the Appellant before the hearing. Although the Appellant did not rely on the evidence in the CBSA notes to explain the omission of the XXXX 2018 attack from his BOC, I considered whether the reference in those notes reasonably explains the omission from the BOC. The reason I find that it does not is that, in the Appellant's BOC, he alleged that the XXXX XXXX, 2018 was the last attack he suffered and that it precipitated his running to Canada.42 The omission of any particulars regarding an attack, more than three months later, that allegedly left the Appellant with a scar is a material omission.\n[31] I find that the Appellant's explanation for his failure to make any effort to obtain a medical report to corroborate his injury is not reasonable. The Appellant's desire to forget about events in South Africa is not a reasonable explanation. Although he was not questioned about whether he sought medical treatment after the XXXX attack, I find that he has not reasonably explained why he did not try to get a medical report in Canada to corroborate that he has a scar consistent with an attack by a bottle. I find that he has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he was the victim of a xenophobic attack in XXXX 2018, as alleged.\nThe alleged attack on the Appellant's XXXX partner in XXXX 2018\n[32] The Appellant testified that, after he was personally attacked in XXXX, there were attacks at his XXXX XXXX on different occasions.43 He testified that the last attack occurred at the beginning of XXXX, causing the death of his partner and making the Appellant decide to leave South Africa.44 The RPD drew a negative inference from the absence of any documentary evidence about the Appellant's XXXX partner. I find no error in this. On an independent assessment, I find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that his XXXX partner was killed in a xenophobic attack, as alleged.\n[33] The Appellant's evidence was that the death of his XXXX partner, following a xenophobic attack, was the reason he left South Africa. When the RPD asked him why he did not mention the attack on his partner in his BOC, the Appellant testified that he mentioned it by saying \"I have watched friends and colleagues maimed, plundered, murdered, while the police stood and did nothing.\"45 He testified that he just said \"a colleague\" in his BOC and thought he would elaborate on this at the hearing.46 The significance of this event, which was allegedly the catalyst for the Appellant's departure, is such that, in my view, evidence about it is not merely an elaboration on the Appellant's vague and general statement in his BOC. He provided no documents to support his allegation that he had a XXXX partner, that they operated XXXX XXXX together, that his XXXX partner died, or that his XXXX partner's death was caused by a violent attack.\n[34] The Appellant's failure to establish the attacks alleged in XXXX 2018 and XXXX 2018 raises concerns about his credibility. In particular, it raises concerns about the credibility of his allegation that there were repeated attacks, driven by xenophobia, at his XXXX XXXX. In the circumstances, I find that the credibility of his allegation regarding the death of his XXXX partner is undermined by the total absence of any corroborative documentation.\n[35] The Appellant testified that he did not report any of the attacks.47 His reason for not reporting was his belief that the police are part of the reason for xenophobic attacks and they have no consideration for foreigners.48 The Appellant testified that did not need a police report for insurance purposes because he had no insurance coverage on his XXXX.49 Accepting these explanations as reasonable for purposes of the analysis, I draw a negative inference from the absence of corroborative evidence regarding the identity of the XXXX partner and his death. For example, there is no documentary evidence from the Appellant's XXXX showing the location of the XXXX XXXX, or that the Appellant and his partner operated a XXXX together. There is no death notice, funeral announcement, or death certificate in respect of the partner. There are no affidavits or letters from the Appellant's wife or from family members, colleagues, or associates of the deceased partner to corroborate his association with the Appellant and his death.\nThe Appellant has not established that he was the victim of repeated xenophobic attacks in South Africa, on a balance of probabilities\n[36] The Appellant alleged that he was the victim of repeated xenophobic attacks. For the reasons I have given, he failed to establish his specific allegations that he was twice personally attacked and his XXXX partner was attacked and killed, on a balance of probabilities. His failure to establish these allegations undermines his credibility, generally, in respect of his allegation that he was repeatedly the victim of xenophobic attacks. Consequently, I find that he has not established his allegation that he was the victim of xenophobic attacks, on a balance of probabilities.\n[37] The RPD found that the Appellant's international driving permit (IDP) was likely a fraudulent document and that this undermined his credibility as a witness, raising the need for corroborative evidence to support his allegations. I find it unnecessary to address the Appellant's arguments with respect to the RPD's finding on the IDP because, even if I were to find that the RPD erred, the error would not be determinative. This is because I have explained why, for other reasons, the Appellant's testimony raises doubts about his credibility concerns and raises the need for corroborative evidence.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellant did not establish a link between his circumstances and the evidence of country conditions\n[38] The RPD found that the Appellant did not establish a credible link between his personal circumstances and the objective evidence that Nigerians are often the target of xenophobic violence in South Africa. The Appellant argues that his testimony provides that link and is presumed to be truthful. I am not persuaded by the Appellant's argument. I see no error in the RPD's finding. I have already explained why I find that the Appellant has not established his allegations of xenophobic attacks in South Africa, on a balance of probabilities. I considered whether the evidence of the Appellant's personal circumstances, in conjunction with the evidence of country conditions, establishes that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a subsection 97(1) risk in South Africa. I find that it does not.\n[39] I considered the objective evidence of xenophobic violence in South Africa, including against Nigerians.50 The Federal Court has said that claimants cannot rely solely on country condition evidence to establish their claims.51 A claimant has a burden to establish a link between general documentary evidence and the claimant's specific circumstances.52\n[40] There is objective evidence before me that xenophobic violence \"often\" targets Nigerians, Somalis, Malawians, Pakistanis and Zimbabweans.53 The evidence documents violent incidents including murder, injuries, threats of mob violence, looting and the destruction of residential property and businesses, as well as mass displacement.54 According to sources, targets of xenophobia are mainly \"poor black foreigners from Africa\" and incidents of violence were generally \"concentrated in areas characterized by poverty and lack of services.\"55 The United States Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices for 2021 indicated that xenophobic violence was a continuing problem in South Africa, especially in Gauteng Province, and that those targeted often owned or managed small, informal grocery stores in economically marginalized areas that lacked government services.56\n[41] The Appellant testified that xenophobic attacks are a general thing in South Africa but the attacks on him, personally, began in XXXX 2018.57 I have explained why I find that he has not established the attacks, as alleged.\n[42] The Appellant's evidence is that he moved to South Africa in 2001, married a South African citizen with whom he had a child in 2004, and became a permanent resident in 2015.58 His evidence is that he has a XXXX Degree in XXXX XXXX,59 a history of working in South Africa as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of a XXXX for over six years and as a XXXX XXXX XXXX for more than four years.60 The Appellant's evidence is that he participated in three social groups in Johannesburg, including the XXXX and the XXXX XXXX South Africa, in which he was vice-chairman and secretary.61 He testified that, before leaving South Africa, he lived in Johannesburg with his wife in a house that they bought and owned.62 His evidence was that he traveled to Nigeria for visits in 2016, 2017, and again in 2018 and that, prior to 2016, he traveled often to Nigeria.63\n[43] Assessing the evidence in its totality, including the evidence of the Appellant's personal circumstances, I find that it does not establish more than a mere possibility that he would be the victim of a xenophobic attack. His level of education, employment background, social connections, and domestic circumstances distinguish him from the typical targets of xenophobic violence. In addition, he lived in South Africa for over fifteen years. He did not allege that he experienced discrimination on the basis of his identity as a Nigerian. He has not established a link between his personal circumstances and the evidence of country conditions.\n[44] I do not find that the evidence establishes that the Appellant, in his personal circumstances, faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a subsection 97(1) risk in South Africa.\nThe RPD correctly concluded that there was no evidence to indicate that the Appellant faces a risk in South Africa from agents of the Nigerian government\n[45] In his BOC, the Appellant alleged that, in South Africa, he was a \"marked man\" for possible elimination by agents of the Nigerian government because of his membership in the IPOB.64 In his testimony, he stated that he fears being killed in a xenophobic attack by hoodlums in South Africa.65 He testified that he fears no one in South Africa other than hoodlums.66 The RPD found that there was no evidence to support the Appellant's allegation in his BOC. The Appellant has not challenged this finding and I see no error in it. On an independent assessment, I reach the same conclusion.\nThe RPD did not err by failing to consider the Appellant's situation in Nigeria\n[46] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by focusing on his allegation that he fears returning to South Africa and not considering his situation in Nigeria. I find no merit in this argument. The RPD found that the Appellant was excluded from refugee protection by operation of section 98 of the IRPA and Article 1E of the Refugee Convention. On an independent assessment, I reach the same conclusion, for the reasons I have given. This was dispositive of the claim at the RPD and it is dispositive of the appeal. There was, and is, no need to assess the evidence regarding the Appellant's circumstances, should he return to Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] For the reasons I have given, I find that the Appellant is excluded from refugee protection by virtue of Article 1E.\n[48] I dismiss the appeal. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, I confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nC. Lindberg\nC.

Bobkin\nTribunal\nCounsel for the person who is the subject of the appeal\nSeyfi Sun\nConseil de la personne en cause\nDesignated representative\nN\/A\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I dismiss the appeal of XXXX XXXX (the Appellant), a citizen of China.\n[2] The Appellant came to Canada in 2003 on a student visa. He alleges that, some time in 2004 or 2005, he lost touch with his parents. He alleges that, when he contacted his aunts and uncles, they would not answer or respond to him. He alleges that, in 2006, he received news from a childhood friend in the police that his parents were Falun Gong (FG) practitioners and that they had been killed. He alleges that the friend told him not to return to China. The Appellant remained in Canada. He had a XXXX in 2020. He alleges that, after this, he learned about the refugee protection process and therefore made his claim.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) identified credibility and forward-looking risk as the determinative issues. However, the RPD made no negative credibility findings. The RPD did find that the Appellant's substantial delay in claiming undermined his subjective fear. The RPD also found that the Appellant had not established a forward-looking risk. The RPD found any risk in the future to be speculative.\n[4] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by stating that credibility was an issue and not making any findings. The Appellant also argues that delay in claiming is insufficient to defeat his claim. Finally, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in concluding that he had no forward-facing risk. He argues that, given he is credible, this establishes his risk. He also argues that the country conditions support his allegations of risk. The Appellant has not submitted new evidence, nor has he requested a hearing.\n[5] I find that the determinative issue is forward-facing risk. I agree with the Appellant that the RPD did not make any negative credibility findings. I accept his evidence for the purpose of assessment. I find that subjective fear is not determinative, and I will not address it. I find that the evidence does not establish more than a mere possibility of persecution or a section 97 risk, on a balance of probabilities, on a forward-facing basis.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[7] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1 I find the RPD's decision is correct.\n[8] The RPD correctly found that the Appellant had not established a forward-facing risk. The Appellant argues that this is incorrect for two main reasons. First, he argues that, given he is credible, the RPD must accept his testimony which is that his life is at risk in China. Second, he argues that documentary evidence supports his argument that he is at risk.\n[9] I reject these arguments. First, I find that just because the Appellant is credible (i.e., telling the truth) does not mean he has established a risk. Second, I find that the country documents do not establish that all family members of FG practitioners are at risk, and the evidence does not support a finding of risk in the Appellant's case.\n[10] The RPD also identified credibility as a determinative issue. However, as noted by the Appellant, no credibility findings were made. Therefore, I am accepting the Appellant's allegations as credible for the purposes of assessment. I will not address the Appellant's arguments on credibility except as they pertain to his forward-facing risk. Additionally, I find that the issue of subjective fear is not determinative, and I will not address the Appellant's arguments on this point. I am not relying on delay in claiming in reaching my conclusion.\nCredibility does not automatically equate to establishing risk\n[11] I find that concluding the Appellant is credible is not tantamount to finding that he is at risk, as the Appellant submits.\n[12] The Appellant argues that the RPD cannot make a finding of a lack of credibility based on a lack of documentary evidence. He argues that there is no evidence to contradict his statements, and the Board cannot draw unsupported inferences. He argues that there is a presumption of truth; therefore, the RPD erred in not accepting his testimony.\n[13] I find the Appellant's arguments misconstrue the law on credibility. As stated above, I accept the Appellant's allegations as credible for the purposes of analysis. This does not necessarily equate to a finding that he is at risk.\n[14] The Appellant's evidence is as follows:\n(a) He lost contact with his parents after coming to Canada in 2003.\n(b) His relatives would not talk to him or explain what happened.\n(c) In 2006, he learned from a childhood friend, who was a member of the police force, that his parents were killed for being FG practitioners. He alleges that the friend told him \"Don't you all want to die? They're all dead! Don't come to me again. You don't come back home. You can do it yourself!\"2\n(d) The Appellant has not spoken to the friend since 2006. He has had no further news from China since this time.\n[15] Accepting this as credible does not necessarily mean that the Appellant has established a section 96 or 97 risk on the necessary threshold.\n[16] As the Federal Court has explained, credibility is about truthfulness and reliability.3 Finding that the Appellant is credible simply means that the above statements are true and accurate (on a balance of probabilities). This does not necessarily mean they are probative of risk. Probative value is the ability of evidence to establish a conclusion.4 In my view, the facts above do not establish the conclusion of risk, on the correct threshold.\n[17] The evidence does not establish that the Chinese government was looking for the Appellant or was even aware of him at the time the Appellant's parents disappeared. The fact that the friend said \"[d]on't you all want to die\" is too vague to establish any specific risk to the Appellant at this time. Moreover, the evidence does not show that the government has had any interest in him in the over 15 years since he learned of his parents' death.\n[18] In my view, accepting the evidence as credible is insufficient to establish more than a mere possibility of persecution or a section 97 risk, on a balance of probabilities. The evidence does not even establish that the Appellant himself (who is not an FG practitioner) was at risk in 2006.\nCountry conditions documents do not establish risk, in this case\n[19] The RPD correctly assessed the country conditions. The RPD considered that there was evidence that family members of FG practitioners were sometimes subjected to harassment, detention, ill-treatment or torture. The RPD also considered that this particularly happens when charges are brought against the FG practitioners or when family is used to try and get practitioners to stop. Finally, the RPD considered that the evidence shows there was no obvious logic as to why some people are targeted and others are not.\n[20] The RPD correctly concluded that, given there was no evidence that the Chinese state was pursuing the Appellant, and his parents had already died, this evidence was not sufficient to establish a risk in his case.\n[21] The Appellant argues that persecution of family members of FG practitioners is well documented. The Appellant points to the same evidence cited by the RPD. I agree with both the RPD and the Appellant that this evidence shows there is some chance that, as the family member of FG practitioners, the Appellant could face a range of treatment from harassment to discrimination up to persecution.\nConsidering the evidence in its totality, the Appellant has not established a forward-facing risk\n[22] I find that the Appellant has not established that he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution on a forward-facing basis considering the country conditions and the personal evidence in its totality. The Appellant submits that, given he is credible, he is the child of FG practitioners who were subject to persecution, therefore he will face persecution. I do not find that this is established.\n[23] I find the country conditions suggest that it is not discernible which family members of FG practitioners are subject to mistreatment, but there is an increased likelihood if the FG practitioner is currently being pursued in court or being sought. The evidence shows that the Appellant's parents have been deceased for at least 17 years and therefore cannot be currently pursued. There is no evidence that the Appellant was ever sought in relation to his parents, or that Chinese authorities were ever aware of him. When I consider this together, I find that it does not meet the threshold of more than a mere possibility or persecution. I find that there is a possibility of persecution, but nothing more.\n[24] For the same reasons, I find that the Appellant has not established that he faces a section 97 risk, on a balance of probabilities, as this is a higher threshold.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nErin Bobkin\nE.

She is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated August 2, 2022, rejecting her claim for refugee protection.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The determinative issue is the lack of a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[3] The Appellant presented no new evidence, so I cannot convene an oral hearing.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The Appellant is a young adult who fears that she will be persecuted in Vietnam because of her Roman Catholic faith. In XXXX 2017, she came to Canada to continue her education and attended a Catholic XXXX XXXX. Soon thereafter she became a Roman Catholic. In XXXX 2019, the Appellant returned to Vietnam for a three-month stay. While there she attended a house church on a weekly basis. In XXXX 2020, after returning to Canada, the Appellant alleges that she received a phone call from her mother advising her that the house church she had attended was discovered by the police. Three members were arrested, and the police visited the Appellant's home looking for her. Fearing for her safety, the Appellant made a claim for refugee protection.\nANALYSIS\n[5] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1\n[6] The RPD determined that the Appellant is a Roman Catholic. However, it determined that she did not credibly establish that she is being sought in Vietnam because she attended an unregistered house church. The RPD also found that the Appellant could practice her religion freely by joining a registered church.\n[7] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by miscomprehending the objective evidence and concluding that there is not an objective basis for her fears of arrest by the police and of not being able to practice her faith freely. She submits that the RPD unreasonably rejected her testimony about her house church being shut down and her being sought by the police. She also argues that the RPD erred in finding that she could practice in a registered house church.\n[8] I agree with the RPD that the Appellant established, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a genuine Catholic. I also agree, however, that the Appellant has not established a serious possibility of future persecution.\nThe RPD did not misapprehend the objective evidence\n[9] The Constitution of Vietnam guarantees freedom of religion and belief;2 however it is regulated by the 2018 Law on Religion and Belief. The objective evidence shows that the Vietnamese Government recognizes 39 religious organizations and that one quarter of the population, about 24 million Vietnamese are religious. Of those, 7% identify as Catholic.3 Vietnam has over 25,000 places of worship in the country and about 9,000 religious festivals per year.4\n[10] Catholicism is a recognized religion in Vietnam. The objective evidence shows that, generally, members of officially recognized religions can practice their religion freely for the most part, and that relations with the Catholic church are improving.5\n[11] The United Nations reports that religious groups in Vietnam coexist in harmony, with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Vietnam Full Gospel Church receiving recognition in 2016 and 2018.6 The country has 60 religious schools, including Catholic schools, with 5 new schools being established in 2015-2017. The state grants land for use by religious organizations and institutes and allows for the production of religious books and other publications such newspapers and magazines.7\n[12] The objective evidence also indicates that the treatment of religious groups and individuals will vary depending on whether they are recognized or registered or not, the area they are based in, local issues, ethnicity, and the perceived level of threat they represent.8 In general, Catholics are able to worship freely and receive sacraments such as the Eucharist and Confirmation; however, those that are perceived to challenge the interests of the Communist Party through political activism face a moderate risk of official discrimination from the authorities, including arrest.9 The Appellant submits that members of unregistered house churches are targeted. I do not agree; the evidence states that it is members of unregistered religious organizations that get involved in local political issues or advocate for democracy who have been subject to harassment, arrest, and detention.10 The Appellant has not engaged in such activities.\n[13] The Appellant cites the US Department of State (DOS) International Religious Freedom Report for 2021 to show that unregistered religious groups face harassment without engaging in political activism. While I accept that there are examples of police monitoring, harassment, and detention, religious leaders also reported improving conditions, with better relations between unregistered groups and local authorities, and members of recognized groups saying that they were generally able to practice their beliefs with less government interference.11 The Appellant is of Kinh ethnicity, which is the ethnic majority in Vietnam. The same report states that Kinh adherents mostly reported the ability to practice without significant restrictions as long as they acted transparently to official oversight and that this was equally true for both registered and unregistered religious groups.12 Further, the Appellant resides in XXXX XXXX, which is a large metropolis of a half million people, nestled halfway between Hanoi and Haiphong, two of the largest cities in Vietnam.13 The objective evidence states that large cities tend to be more open in allowing religious observance without official interference.14\n[14] The Appellant also cites National Documentation Package (NDP) item 12.2 for the notion that Vietnam engages in systematic violations of religious freedom. A review of that evidence shows that it refers almost exclusively to minority Protestant and Montagnard Christians, some Hoa Hao, and Cai Dai followers. There is no reference to Roman Catholics being adversely affected.\n[15] I also do not accept that the RPD downplayed the persecution unregistered and sometimes registered Catholic churches experience in Vietnam, as submitted by the Appellant. A careful reading of the evidence shows that while members of unregistered groups may face discrimination, it does not necessarily rise to the level of persecution.15 The risk depends on the views of the group toward the state, the state's view of the group, and the activities of the person. The Appellant testified that she never attended protests or spoke out against the government.16 She has not engaged in any political or human rights activities. The RPD did not misapprehend the objective evidence. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, given the personal circumstances of the Appellant, she can freely practice Catholicism in Vietnam.\nThe Appellant can practice freely in a registered church\n[16] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding that registered Catholic churches in Vietnam do not practice the religion any differently than unregistered churches. She argues that the RPD unreasonably expects her to conform to limitations on her faith and faith practices contrary to case law.\n[17] The Appellant testified that her friend told her that registered churches talk more about parties than religion.17 Her friend did not tell her how many times she attended a registered church. She had no other evidence of such other than what her friend told her. In her Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative, the Appellant states that her friend told her that the registered church asked her friend to join the Communist Party. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant has not presented any credible evidence to establish her proposition. One anecdotal comment by her friend is insufficient evidence; there is no context provided about the friend's experience with that one specific church and the RPD correctly points out that the friend does not benefit from the presumption of truth. The Appellant was represented by able counsel and had ample opportunity to provide corroborative evidence of her position, after the RPD hearing or as new evidence to this appeal but did not do so. I have reviewed the objective documentary evidence and it provides no evidence of any distinction in the way the faith is practiced between registered and unregistered churches. I would expect that if such differences did exist, they would be elaborated on in the NDP. Rather, the evidence indicates Catholics in cities worship freely in churches.18 There is no mention of limitations on faith practices. The RPD did not err.\nThe Appellant is not wanted in Vietnam\n[18] While I agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred in discounting letters from her mother and friend simply because the objective evidence does not corroborate what is described in the letters, nevertheless, I find that the Appellant is not wanted in Vietnam.\n[19] The Appellant provided in her BOC that she fears arrest in Vietnam. The Appellant testified that the police visited her home in Vietnam on XXXX XXXX, 2020 after arresting some of her friends when their house church was discovered.19 She also testified that she has never been charged by the police nor did they ever provide a warrant or summons for her.\n[20] The Appellant stated that she talks to her mother, who remains in Vietnam, once a week. When counsel asked the Appellant about what information her mom gave her regarding the situation in Vietnam, the Appellant sought clarification about whether counsel meant currently or before when the police came to the house.\n[21] The Appellant's mother provided a letter20 stating that the police had come to look for her once her church group was discovered and threatened that if she did not return to Vietnam, her family would be in trouble. She states that the last time was on the Pure Brightness Festival, but there is no date provided. It is unclear from the letter that the police are still searching for the Appellant. The Appellant's testimony and the letter from her mother speak of past police visits, not ongoing activity. It is unclear if the police searched for the Appellant after 2020. Though she speaks to her mother weekly, there is no evidence that the police have sought the Appellant recently or that any harm has come to the family since the police made their threat to them in 2020. There is no evidence of any warrant or summons for the Appellant. The evidence does not support that the Appellant is currently of interest to the authorities as she submits. I assign little weight to the letter in establishing a forward-looking risk for the Appellant. While the police may have wanted to speak to the Appellant because her name was found on a list21 in the house church she attended in late 2019, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the evidence does not support that the Appellant is wanted by the Vietnamese police.\n[22] Similarly, the letter22 from the Appellant's friend is also assigned little weight. It establishes that the friend was questioned by the police and had to report monthly in the past after her group was discovered in XXXX 2020. The letter does not establish that the Appellant is wanted by the authorities or faces a forward-looking risk.\n[23] I find that there is not a serious possibility that the Appellant would be persecuted if she returned to Vietnam, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).23 I also find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Vietnam, pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nRon Stratigopoulos\nRon Stratigopoulos\n21 February 2023\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX (Appellant), a citizen of India, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated August 19, 2022, rejecting his claim for refugee protection under either section 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\"IRPA\").1\nDECISION\n[2] I find that the RPD did not err in its decision that the Appellant is neither a Convention2 refugee nor a person in need of protection. I further find that the determinative factor regarding the application of both section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA is the availability of a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Hyderabad, India. I therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.3\nOVERVIEW\n[3] The Appellant was born in 1989 and raised in XXXX, Uttar Pradesh, India. He claimed in his basis of claim form (BOC) that he, a Sikh, loved a Muslim woman, S, who became pregnant. His friend XXXX XXXX (who supports the radical Hindu organization, XXXX XXXX), criticized him for being with a Muslim woman and directed XXXX XXXX \"goons\" to beat the Appellant and the woman, whom he alleges they murdered. The Appellant alleges that following the beating, he awoke in a cell in the local police station to police accusing him of killing the Muslim woman. They took his signature and fingerprints, then released him two days later, following the payment of a sizeable bribe. The Appellant alleges that the police continue to visit his family home and ask about his whereabouts since he fled-first to Delhi and then to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, filing for protection in March 2020.\n[4] A hearing was held on June 13, 2022. The Appellant was represented by counsel. The possible internal flight alternative (IFA) of Hyderabad was canvassed by the RPD. The RPD reserved its judgement and found, on August 19, 2022, that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Hyderabad. Specifically, the RPD found that the Appellant:\na) Failed to establish that the agents of persecution would be able to track the Appellant in the proposed IFA because:\na. The Appellant did not establish that the agents of persecution or harm (the Uttar Pradesh police, XXXX XXXX, his father and XXXX XXXX), would be able to track the Appellant to the IFA; and\nb. The Appellant failed to establish with sufficient evidence that the Appellant would be found through family, and\nb) The Appellant failed to establish that it would be unreasonable for him to relocate to the proposed IFA.\n[5] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding:\na) that police lacked the means to find him using tenant verification, as he is still a person of interest;\nb) erred in failing to sufficiently consider the situation of Sikhs and lower castes in India.\n[6] The Appellant is neither disclosing new evidence nor is he requesting an oral hearing.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[7] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.4\nANALYSIS\nIFA\n[8] There is a two-pronged test for assessing an IFA:5\n(1) The Board [Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada] must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimants would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) The conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimants to seek refuge there.\nBoth prongs of the test must be satisfied to find that the Appellant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and potential IFAs identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellant to show that he does not have an IFA.\n[9] The RPD found that a viable IFA existed in Hyderabad and that both prongs were satisfied. The Appellant argues on appeal that the RPD erred in its analysis of the viability of the IFA, specifically, the Appellant argues that his agents of persecution have the means to track him to Hyderabad. The Appellant also argues that Hyderabad is not reasonable as an IFA for the Appellant because the RPD failed to take into account his status as a member of one of India's Scheduled Castes.\nThe first prong\nThe police lack the means to trace the Appellant\n[10] I find the Uttar Pradesh police lack the means to trace the Appellant to the IFA. The Appellant claimed that he will be traced to the IFA by the Uttar Pradesh police by means of the tenant registration system when he registers with a landlord in Hyderabad. The RPD found that the Appellant's detention was likely extra-judicial in nature and that therefore his fingerprints and photograph would not have been recorded into the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) and that therefore the Uttar Pradesh police would not have the means to trace him to the IFA. The Appellant argues, on appeal, that the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package for India (NDP) indicates that the tenant registration system is both compulsory in Hyderabad and is effective in enabling the police to locate persons of interest. The Appellant argues that the recent RAD decision of X (2019), where the RAD found that an IFA was not available because of the efficacy of the tenant registration system, shows the non-viability of an IFA for the Appellant in this instant appeal.6\n[11] I have independently reviewed the record before me. The Appellant did not allege or testify that any conditions were placed on his release, and he has disclosed no evidence that he broke any conditions established by the police. The Appellant was not formally charged with a crime, was never brought before a judge or a magistrate, was released without charge or any further criminal proceedings, with only the warning to beware-after the payment of a bribe. The objective evidence indicates that, as none of the usual police protocols of a judicial arrest were observed during the Appellant's detention, no First Information Report (FIR) would have been registered against the Appellant, nor has the Appellant disclosed any evidence of an FIR having been registered against him.7 This is significant because the tenant registration process functions by local police-upon receiving a request for verification through the tenant registration system-consult the CCTNS in order to determine whether the prospective tenant has current or pending criminal charges against him and to otherwise verify whether-and in what ways-he has a profile in the CCTNS.8 The objective information in the NDP indicates that the lack of compliance with the protocols of a judicial arrest (outlined above) is characteristic of an extra-judicial detention, regarding which the police deliberately avoid creating a paper trail and do not enter information regarding persons who are subjected to such detentions into CCTNS.9 I therefore find that information on the Appellant would, on the balance of probabilities, not appear in the CCTNS and that therefore, the police would not be able to trace him to Hyderabad through the CCTNS.\n[12] Moreover, I concur with the RPD and find it did not err in finding that the objective evidence in the NDP indicates that the CCTNS remains at an operative level of \"islands of technology which can only communicate within a state or district.\"10 The objective evidence in the NDP also indicates that \"India does not have a centralized registration system in place to enable the police to check the whereabouts of inhabitants in their own states, let alone in any of the other states.\"11 The same request for information also indicates that while information may be being steadily entered into the database, police, generally, are uncomfortable with the technology and are reluctant to conduct searches. The report indicates that the rate at which local police log on to conduct searches indicates a \"very low level of actual utilization.\"12 Moreover, the objective evidence in the NDP also indicates that tenant verification is \"extremely limited\" due to the volume of workers who have migrated to large cities and is done \"only for the psychological satisfaction, not for actual background check,\" as the police do not make any efforts to follow up with the relevant police stations of other Indian states.13 Additionally, the electronic data systems are reported as often being inadequate, and the entire tenant verification process has several loopholes.14 Finally, the objective evidence in the NDP also indicates that the police force is ill-equipped and short-staffed to actually carry out such verifications when they get over 50 forms a day and that information about tenants is very limited. For all the above reasons, I find, on the balance of probabilities, that the police do not have the means to locate the Appellant in Hyderabad through the tenant verification system.\n[13] The Appellant has argued that the 2019 RAD appeal of X (XXXX) the RAD found that the tenant registration system put the Appellants in jeopardy because there was a chance that information of their new whereabouts would find its way back to their local police. In that appeal, the RAD found that police forces in India do not consistently follow through with the tenant verification process and, moreover, it was highly unlikely that police would communicate across state lines in the search for individuals who are not only seriously suspected of, but wanted for, major crimes. The RAD also found that the CCTNS does not contain information regarding persons of interest. Notwithstanding, however, the RAD also found that there still remained a chance that the tenant verification system might enable local police to find the Appellants. However, in that case, the Appellant (who was being used as an informant by the police) had been arrested and tortured and released and re-arrested and released upon conditions to report to the point where it was reasonable for the RAD to find that the personal circumstances of the Appellant in that case was such that their local police were interested in finding them. In the instant appeal, the Appellant was released after paying a bribe, no strictures were placed on him, he was not asked to report to the police regularly or at all. I therefore find that the circumstances in the two cases are not materially similar.\nThe Father of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX\n[14] The Appellant alleged that because XXXX XXXX father is a well-connected local politician-the block leader for their district-that XXXX XXXX and his colleagues in XXXX XXXX will be easily able to deploy the police and trace the Appellant to Hyderabad through them, using the tenant registration system. The RPD found that the political influence of XXXX XXXX father was likely confined to Uttar Pradesh and that the Appellant had not established that he would be of interest to XXXX XXXX in Hyderabad. The RPD also cited the objective evidence in the NDP that XXXX XXXX principally had an active presence in Maharashtra, Bihar, Haryana, Goa, Punjab, and West Bengal-but not Uttar Pradesh. The RPD also noted that the proposed IFA, Hyderabad, is located in the Indian state of Telangana and that there was no indication in the NDP that XXXX XXXX had a meaningful presence in Telangana. The RPD thus found that XXXX XXXX would not be able to track the Appellant to Hyderabad.\n[15] The Appellant argues on appeal that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have the means to track him to the IFA as their influential political connections (through XXXX father), enables them to deploy the local police to trace those they wish to find. The Appellant argues that as he believes his arrest was made through political pressure from XXXX XXXX father and XXXX XXXX supporters, that their close influence over the local police will enable XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to find him, gaining access to information on his whereabouts through the police deploying the tenant registration system. I have already found that the police themselves are unable to trace the Appellant using the tenant registration system, I further find that, even were the father of XXXX XXXX able to influence or coerce the local police, the police would still lack the means to track the Appellant to Hyderabad because no FIR or other information regarding the Appellant was likely entered into the CCTNS system.\n[16] The Appellant has also argued on appeal that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX seek to pursue him because they, too, want to blame him for their murder of S. I have independently reviewed the record before me. The RPD found that, although the XXXX XXXX had support and a popular base in some states, they lacked support in Telegana, where Hyderabad is located and for that reason, XXXX XXXX was unable to pursue the Appellant to the IFA. Having independently reviewed the record before me, including the NDP, I also find, and for the same reasons, that-even if local Uttar Pradesh XXXX XXXX were motivated to pursue the Appellant across state lines-nothing in the NDP concerning XXXX XXXX (and nothing the Appellant has disclosed) indicates that local, Uttar Pradeshi XXXX XXXX would be able to motivate XXXX XXXX in Telegana, where they lacked support. I therefore find that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX power does not extend beyond a localized influence.\n[17] I find, therefore, for all the above reasons, that the father of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX do not have the means to pursue the Appellant to Hyderabad.\nThe agents of persecution\/harm lack the motivation to pursue the Appellant to the IFA\n[18] Having already found that the Uttar Pradesh police lack the means to trace the Appellant to Hyderabad, I do not need to find that they also possess the motivation to do so as the Appellant must show-regarding the first prong of the test-that the police have both means, as well as motivation, to pursue him to the IFA.\n[19] Notwithstanding, I find the police also lack the motivation to pursue the Appellant in the IFA, because they do not genuinely suspect him of having committed a crime. The Appellant, in his BOC, alleged that he is a person of interest to his agents of harm because they wish to blame him for the murder of his partner, killed by XXXX XXXX goons. The Appellant also alleges that he was released after the police were paid a bribe and that no release conditions were imposed on him beyond a warning that he should beware and he testified consistently with those allegations. The affidavits of both his mother and the sarpanch of his village confirm this testimony. The objective information in the NDP indicates that the lack of compliance with the protocols of a judicial arrest (outlined above) is characteristic of an extra-judicial detention, regarding which the police avoid creating a paper trail and do not enter information regarding persons who are subjected to such detentions into CCTNS.15 I find, on the balance of probabilities, that had the police actually considered the Appellant a criminal, they would not have released him without at least restricting his movements or by issuing some reporting requirement. The objective evidence in the NDP also indicates that the police cross borders to search only for persons of interest in high profile cases (such as the murder of a high-ranking politician's daughter). \"There is little inter-state police communication except for cases of major crimes like smuggling, terrorism and some high-profile organized crime.\"16 The Appellant did not allege, nor did he testify that his profile comported with that of a high-profile person of interest. The Appellant has argued that XXXX XXXX father and XXXX XXXX have influence over the local police, as this is what compelled the police to arrest him in the first place, and this motivates the police to pursue the Appellant. I find, on the balance of probabilities, that-because the police do not genuinely suspect the Appellant of having committed any criminal offence-while the police may have been motivated to arrest and detain the Appellant initially in order to extort him, this is not sufficient to establish that they would go to the extent of initiating a cross-border search to Hyderabad to continue to pursue him. The fact that no conditions whatever were imposed on the Appellant indicates, to me, that, on the balance of probabilities, having received their bribe, the local police ceased to have continuing interest in the Appellant. For all the above reasons, I find the police on the balance of probabilities, do not have the motivation to pursue the Appellant to the IFA.\n[20] The RPD also found that there was insufficient evidence to support the Appellant's being traced to Hyderabad through family. The Appellant has not challenged this finding. I have reviewed the record and I concur with the RPD and for the same reasons-that there is no evidence or testimony by the Appellant that the police have threatened the Appellant's family or that there is any danger for the Appellant's family in misrepresenting the Appellant's whereabouts.\n[21] I therefore find that the first prong of the test is met, that is, there is no serious possibility of the Appellant's being persecuted by the police, nor, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger in Hyderabad.\nThe second prong\n[22] Every relocation entails hardship. The threshold is whether a given claimant will undergo great physical danger or undue hardship in travelling or staying in the proposed IFA.17 The Federal Court of Appeal, in Ranganathan, found that hardship associated with dislocation and relocation is not in itself sufficient to render an IFA unreasonable. The court in that decision set out:\n[A] very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized.18\n[23] I find that the Appellant has not established that relocation to Hyderabad would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh in his circumstances. The Appellant alleged that he is a member of a Scheduled Caste and disclosed his mother's certificate to support this claim. The RPD found that the Appellant was a sophisticated person whose disclosed record of world travel, supported by ample discretionary funds was evidence that it was reasonable to find that the Appellant would be able to successfully relocate to Hyderabad. The RPD also found that his education and work experience, combined with his understanding of Hindi and conversational English, gave him the tools to enable him to relocate and re-establish himself in Hyderabad. The RPD also weighed the objective evidence in the NDP regarding the barriers to employment and housing encountered by members of the Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes (OBC) and found that given the Appellant's sophistication and financial resources, on a balance of probabilities, if the Appellant were a member of a Scheduled Caste, it would still not render the IFA unreasonable, in the Appellant's circumstances.\n[24] The Appellant had also alleged that, as a Sikh, he would encounter discrimination in attempting to establishing himself in Hyderabad. The RPD found that the objective documentary evidence does not support that Sikhs face persecution in India as a result of their religion or that it would be unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to the IFA because of his religion. On appeal the Appellant argues that the RPD did not sufficiently consider the situation of lower castes in India and the risks they face. The Appellant also argues that he faces double-barrelled discrimination as his religion would present a barrier to establishing himself in Hyderabad.\n[25] I find the Appellant would, on the balance of probabilities, likely not face discrimination amounting to hardship on the basis of his religion-Sikhism-were he to relocate to Hyderabad. I have reviewed the objective evidence in the NDP, which indicates that, generally, Sikhs who live outside Punjab province, do not experience \"noticeable\" issues with health care, education or employment.19 Australia's DFAT, similarly, notes that \"Sikhs in India generally face a low level of official and societal discrimination and violence.\"20 I find, therefore, that the Appellant has not established that he would face discrimination amounting to hardship were he to relocate to Hyderabad.\n[26] I find the Appellant has not established that his status as a member of an OBC or Scheduled Caste would present him with discrimination amounting to such hardship that Hyderabad would be unreasonable for him as an IFA, given his particular situation. The Appellant testified that he belongs to the XXXX caste, which the objective evidence in the NDP indicates is an OBC, occupying a place between the traditional upper castes and the lowest and that while some members of OBCs are well-off and some are landowning and powerful in their own villages other are poor. None, however, are considered Untouchable.21 The Appellant testified that, in his village, his father-and he after his father's death-had worked as farmers on land they owned and that the Appellant had made sufficient money that he was able to travel extensively to Europe and through Asia with the income he derived from his work on their lands. The objective evidence in the NDP indicated that Scheduled Castes do not generally experience discrimination when seeking housing when relocating to an urban area and, since the Appellant has already completed his education, access to education is not applicable in this instance. The NDP also indicates that OBCs do not face discrimination in securing employment.22 The Appellant also testified that he also worked selling their XXXX in the XXXX and that he has acquired experience during his time in Canada, working as a XXXX XXXX. I find, based on the objective evidence, that the Appellant has not demonstrated that his religion or caste or any other personal factors or circumstances would impede his ability to secure reasonable employment or accommodation such that they would render the Appellant's relocation to Hyderabad to be unduly harsh or objectively unreasonable.\n[27] I find that the threshold for the second prong has been met.\n[28] I therefore find that the proposed IFA of Hyderabad satisfies both prongs and is a viable IFA for the Appellant. Consequently, I find that the Appellant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk under section 97 of the IRPA, in India.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAndrea Poole\nAndrea Poole\nJanuary 10, 2023\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n3 IRPA, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, at para 111(1)(a).\n4 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He alleges that he fled Somalia due to his fear of persecution from Al-Shabaab, who wished to forcibly recruit him. The Refugee Protection Division (\"RPD\") rejected his claim, due to his failure to establish his identity and his lack of credibility. I do not agree with every aspect of the RPD's analysis, but after independently assessing the evidence, I have reached the same conclusions about the Appellant's failure to establish his identity. The Refugee Appeal Division (\"RAD\") confirms the RPD's negative decision. The appeal is dismissed, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\"IRPA\").1\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Appellant claims that he lived in the village of XXXX, outside the town of XXXX, in Somalia's Lower Juba region. He alleges that he and his family members were XXXX XXXX. In 2010, Al-Shabaab demanded that the Appellant and his brothers join them. The Appellant refused to join. As a result, the Al-Shabaab members beat the Appellant and his brothers. Their father agreed to pay Al-Shabaab a hefty tax in cash XXXX XXXX on a regular basis, in order to allow them to continue XXXX XXXX.\n[3] This situation persisted until XXXX 2017, when Al-Shabaab returned with demands for the Appellant and his brothers to join them. The Appellant and his brothers were again beaten, and this time their father offered a large sum of money XXXX XXXX XXXX to spare their lives. The Appellant's father agreed to have them join Al-Shabaab, promising that they would be ready to go with them in a week's time. The Appellant's family used that time to sell XXXX XXXX to raise funds for the Appellant and his brothers to escape to Kenya. While in Kenya, Al-Shabaab returned to the Appellant's home. Upon realizing that the Appellant and his brothers had escaped, they killed their father and took the family's XXXX. They told the Appellant's mother that the Appellant and his brothers would suffer the consequences when they were found, and that if they were not found, they would return and kill the rest of the family. This led the Appellant's mother and three sisters to also flee to Kenya.\n[4] In Kenya, the Appellant paid a smuggler $2000 USD, which was supposedly enough for a false passport and visa, as well as a flight to XXXX. The Appellant traveled to XXXX, and then made his way towards the United States (\"US\"), where he arrived in XXXX 2018. He abandoned his asylum claim in the US, believing his chances would be better in Canada. He crossed the border irregularly, arriving in Manitoba in XXXX 2018 to make his refugee claim.\nThe Minister's intervention and proceedings at the RPD\n[5] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (\"the Minister\") intervened in the claim, due to information that came to light from the Appellant's driver's licence application in Ontario, which was filed in January 2019. In that application, the Appellant declared having possessed a driver's licence in Kenya since 2014. He provided a copy of a Kenyan driver's licence that was issued in XXXX 2014 as well as a letter from the Kenya Revenue Authority, confirming the issuance of a driver's licence to the Appellant in Kenya as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Minister submitted that this evidence undermined the Appellant's credibility.\n[6] The RPD heard the Appellant's claim over the course of multiple sittings that took place between May 2021 and July 2022. A written decision was rendered on August 22, 2022, rejecting the claim. The Appellant insisted that the documents in the Minister's intervention were genuine. He explained that he lived with a relative in XXXX (near the Kenyan border) for a few months in order to obtain a driver's licence in Kenya, so that he could supplement his family's income. He stayed in XXXX for the duration of his driving course, regularly traveling across the border to Kenya to attend the course and obtaining a Kenyan driver's licence without possessing any identity documents. He had no explanation for the date of issuance on the Kenya Revenue Authority letter, which was somehow issued while the Appellant was being detained in the US and before any need for it arose. The RPD determined that the Kenyan driver's licence and Kenya Revenue Authority letter were likely fraudulent. The panel also relied on the Appellant's testimony about his period of residence in XXXX, finding that his frequent returns to Somalia from Kenya and his decision to then return to his village in XXXX undermined his credibility in relation to his fear of persecution from Al-Shabaab. The RPD further found that the Appellant's testimony about his family's displacement from the village in 2014 during his time in XXXX was unreasonably omitted from the Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form and narrative. The RPD also doubted the Appellant's description of his journey to the US, as he could not credibly explain how his family managed to fund his payment to his smuggler.\n[7] The RPD considered the Appellant's supporting documents and the testimony of an identity witness. However, the panel noted various discrepancies in the evidence, as well as the absence of evidence that should have been reasonably available. The RPD concluded that the evidence was insufficient to establish the Appellant's claimed identity.\nRole of the Refugee Appeal Division\n[8] The RAD is required to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence and reach its own determination. Deference is owed to the RPD only where the RPD held a meaningful advantage in assessing the evidence.2 In the present case, I see no reason to show deference to any of the RPD's findings. I have applied a correctness standard and arrived at independent findings based on the evidence before me.\nAdmissibility of new evidence and request for an oral hearing\n[9] The Appellant submitted the following documents on appeal, which he describes as being new evidence:\ni. A written statement from one of the Appellant's relatives in Canada, along with a copy of the author's Canadian passport and Ontario driver's licence;3\nii. A paper by Hilary Evans Cameron on omissions in credibility assessments, entitled \"Sin of Omission: Exploring a Key Credibility Inference in Canadian Refugee Status Rejections\";4 and\niii. A paper by Hilary Evans Cameron entitled, \"Risk and the Reasonable Refugee: Exploring a Key Credibility Inference in Canadian Refugee Status Rejections\".5\n[10] Item (i) is inadmissible, but I have reviewed and considered items (ii) and (iii) in reaching a decision on this appeal. I find that items (ii) and (iii) are not subject to the restrictions under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[11] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA states that, on appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may only present evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the claim's rejection. If the new evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, the RAD must then consider factors around the credibility, relevance, and newness of the evidence.6\nItem (i): Statement from Somali relative in Canada\n[12] The author of the written statement in item (i) states that he and the Appellant are related, as their grandmothers are sisters. He met the Appellant for the first time in XXXX 2006 in XXXX village. The author was traveling from Mogadishu to Kenya, and he stayed at the Appellant's mother's home while on his way there. The author stayed with the Appellant and his family for about a month before continuing on his journey. They then reconnected after the Appellant arrived in the US. When the Appellant reached Canada in XXXX 2018, the author provided him with a place to stay, and the two lived together until XXXX 2019.\n[13] The Appellant argues that item (i) is admissible because the author could not provide his evidence before the RPD rendered its decision, due to his international travel as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I find this explanation inadequate. The Appellant arrived in Canada in XXXX 2018, and he and the author were already in contact at that point. They lived together for several months. The Appellant was aware of the importance of establishing his identity. The RPD did not render its decision until August 2022 - nearly four years after the Appellant's arrival. The author's statement is less than two pages long. I do not understand how being a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX prevented the author from completing a relatively short statement for almost four years. Nor do I understand what suddenly changed in the window of time between the issuance of the RPD's decision and the perfection of this appeal that has now permitted him to do this. I am not satisfied that the documents in item (i) meet any of the statutory criteria under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. Item (i) will not be admitted.\nItems (ii) and (iii): Papers by Hilary Evans Cameron\n[14] The papers from Hilary Evans Cameron discuss difficulties in assessing credibility in the context of refugee status determination. The first paper addresses credibility findings based on omissions, and the second paper talks about credibility findings that rely on judgments about refugee claimants' responses to risk. In my view, these documents are not the kind of new evidence contemplated under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. They are not being relied upon to corroborate certain facts, such as whether an incident occurred, nor are they being relied upon to set out the country conditions. The Appellant merely borrows from the reasoning set out in the papers. The restrictions under subsection 110(4) do not apply to these documents. I have therefore considered the papers, and in fact agree that this is one such case where the RPD wrongly held the Appellant to a general and idealized standard of risk response. I have not relied on the RPD's reavailment findings, nor have I relied on the findings about the omissions from the BOC narrative.\nRequest for an oral hearing\n[15] The Appellant requested that a hearing be held in the event that there are any credibility concerns regarding the evidence on record. There are credibility issues, but these were already canvassed by the RPD. And, as no new evidence has been admitted, the RAD is unable to hold an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[16] The determinative issue in this appeal is the Appellant's identity. There is merit to some of the Appellant's arguments about errors in the RPD's decision, and for greater clarity, I have only relied on the findings discussed below that I have specifically endorsed. However, after carefully considering the evidence, I agree with the RPD's conclusion that the Appellant has not established his identity on a balance of probabilities.\nThe Appellant's burden to establish his identity\n[17] Identity is a threshold issue in refugee claims. The jurisprudence confirms that there is no obligation for the decision-maker to further assess the merits of the claim if the claimant's identity has not been established.7 Section 106 of the IRPA provides that the RPD must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether they possess acceptable documentation establishing their identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation. A similar provision is contained under Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (\"RPD Rules\").\n[18] The RPD correctly acknowledged the difficulties faced by many Somali refugee claimants in establishing their identities. Most records were destroyed during the civil war, and many parts of Somalia still lack competent civil authorities to issue documents such as passports, identity cards, and other civil status documents. As of 2018, most of Somalia's population still did not possess any kind of identification.8 Under these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to consider alternative sources of identity evidence, such as identity witnesses, affidavits from family members and others who may be positioned to speak to the claimant's personal and national identity, in conjunction with the claimant's sworn testimony.\nErrors in the RPD's decision regarding relocation to XXXX\n[19] The evidence in the Minister's intervention raised questions about the Appellant's residence history and his possible use of fraudulent documents. The Appellant never claimed any period of residence in Kenya prior to 2017, nor did he indicate that he lived anywhere else in Somalia apart from in his village in XXXX with his family. Still, the Appellant insisted that the Kenyan driver's licence and Kenya Revenue Authority letter were genuine documents. He alleged that he relocated to XXXX in 2014 for a few months, in order to obtain a Kenyan driver's licence and to seek work opportunities. He claimed that during that time, his family moved to another location, not far from where they were before.\n[20] The RPD drew adverse inferences from this. The panel doubted that the Appellant had relocated to XXXX. The RPD believed that the Appellant would have had to drive a significant distance into Kenya, some eight hours, to reach the driving school, which would not have been feasible. Moreover, the information about his relocation to XXXX was omitted from his BOC form. The RPD did not find it likely that the Appellant would risk going by land to the Kenyan border, given the evidence about the road conditions and the risk from Al-Shabaab, especially when driver's licences were available within Somalia. The RPD also did not think it believable that if there was a risk from Al-Shabaab in Somalia, the Appellant would then return to the country and also return to the same village where the threats were present. Finally, the RPD found that the Appellant had unreasonably omitted the fact of his family's displacement from their village.\n[21] I am persuaded by several of the Appellant's arguments on these findings. The RPD misapprehended the Appellant's testimony about the location of the driving school. When asked where he took the driving course, the Appellant responded that the school was called \"XXXX\", and that it was on the Kenyan side of the border. The RPD took this to mean that the school was in the town of XXXX, which is outside of Nairobi and an 8-hour drive from the Somali border. The RPD's finding was not supported by the evidence.\n[22] I also find that the Appellant's stay in XXXX for a couple of months was not a material fact to mention in the BOC narrative. The RPD attempted to characterize the Appellant's stay as a response to his fear from Al-Shabaab, but again this is unsupported by the testimony. The Appellant instead explained that the purpose of his stay in XXXX was primarily economic. He testified that his family had less access to water, that they needed additional income, and that obtaining a driver's licence and learning how to drive was a way to make more income for the family. The RPD questioned this decision due to the safety conditions on the roads, especially from Al-Shabaab. But the Appellant reasonably explained that around this time, his family's situation with Al-Shabaab was relatively stable because his father was paying them. He described that apart from this, the risk from Al-Shabaab was ever present. From the RPD's perspective, this risk might have seemed an unreasonable one to take, but I find that there is little that is implausible about this situation. There was no imminent danger from Al-Shabaab in 2014, and the risks from them had become a familiar hazard that was unavoidable for those living there.9 The events that caused the Appellant to leave Somalia did not occur until XXXX 2017. For these reasons, I do not rely on any of the RPD's findings in this regard.\n[23] As for the omission about the displacement of the Appellant's family during his time in XXXX, I again disagree with the RPD. The Appellant explained in his testimony that his family was worried that Al-Shabaab might find out that he had left, and that they moved to another area as they normally did as nomadic XXXX, but nothing ever happened and so the Appellant did not think it was worth mentioning. As the RPD noted, the Appellant's family did not go very far - only about 30 minutes away on foot. I do not see why such a minor and precautionary move should have been included, especially if nothing ever came of it.\nKenyan driver's licence and Kenya Revenue Authority letter\n[24] However, the RPD correctly concluded that the Appellant did not truly attend a driving course in Kenya, and that both the Kenyan driver's licence and confirmation letter were fraudulent. The Appellant was not a credible witness in this respect, and his reliance on fraudulent documents seriously undermines his overall credibility.\n[25] Apart from the findings discussed above, the RPD also doubted the Appellant's story about the Kenyan driver's licence because:\n* The Appellant claimed that he went through an official border crossing from Somalia to Kenya, and each time did so successfully without any identity documents in his possession;\n* He claimed that he attended the driving course and passed the exam for XXXX XXXX XXXX without knowing the language of instruction, which was Swahili, nor the language of examination, due to the presence of a Swahili-Somali interpreter who was present; and\n* The Appellant could not credibly explain how he successfully obtained a Kenyan driver's licence despite having no official identity documents to submit to the driving school, the approved police examiner, or the office that issued driver's licences in Kenya.\n[26] The RPD also examined the copy of the Kenyan driver's licence and the accompanying confirmation letter, but noted the following problems:\n* The driver's licence was unsigned, and it did not have information that was supposed to be contained in it, such as the Appellant's address and the expiration date of the document; and\n* The confirmation letter from the Kenya Revenue Authority was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2018, but the Appellant was in detention in the US at that time and he did not even seek the letter until his arrival in Canada in 2019.\n[27] As there was no reasonable explanation for these discrepancies, the RPD determined that the documents were fraudulent.\n[28] The Appellant has not identified any error in these particular findings, and I agree entirely with the RPD on them. The Appellant testified that he crossed the border into Kenya sometimes on a bus, sometimes with his relative, and sometimes with his relative's friend. According to the country conditions evidence, much of Somalia's border with Kenya is porous, such that it is possible to travel across without documentation.10 However, the Appellant's testimony was that he crossed at an official border crossing each time. At international borders with border control points, an individual's documentation would be checked in offices located on either side of the border.11\n[29] Even if I could accept that the Appellant's relative somehow made arrangements to exempt the Appellant from identity checks, there remains no credible explanation for the Appellant's ability to take and pass a driving test with an approved police examiner and obtain a Kenyan driver's licence, without ever having to show any kind of identification. The documentary evidence indicates that in Kenya, people are asked to prove their identity in a multitude of settings, and that requests to show identification are \"inescapable\". There were certain situations where producing an official identity document was a legal requirement, such as to obtain a driver's licence. In other situations, such as to enter certain buildings, it was a standard expectation.12 The Appellant claimed that his relative took care of everything, but under these circumstances, the RPD was correct to expect more information. The Appellant was in contact with this relative, who even provided an affidavit in support of his refugee claim, but the relative did not explain what arrangements were made that allowed the Appellant to cross the Kenyan border regularly, attend driving school in Kenya, take a driving exam there, and obtain a Kenyan driver's licence, all without any identification.\n[30] There also remains no reasonable explanation for the contents of the driver's licence and the accompanying confirmation letter. The RPD cited a document from the most recent National Documentation Package for Somalia that was available at the time of the last hearing. That document indicated that prior to the introduction of the smart driver's licence in 2018, the Kenyan driver's licence was a red booklet, containing the licensee's residential address, signature, and an expiration date, among other information.13 The Appellant's driver's licence had none of these three things.14 In addition, the RPD was correct to reject the Appellant's explanation for the date on the confirmation letter. He suggested that the office made a mistake when issuing the letter, but this was not likely, given that it was both dated by hand and also typed on.15 At the time of the document's issuance, the Appellant would have been detained in the US, and moreover, he testified that he only asked his relative to obtain this document for him in 2019, in order to apply for his Ontario driver's licence.\n[31] Given the many unresolved issues that arose with the documents themselves and the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the driver's licence in 2014, I determine that both the driver's licence and the confirmation letter are inauthentic. The Appellant attempts to downplay the significance of these issues, but I find that they are highly material to the assessment of the Appellant's identity. Being inauthentic documents, they do not necessarily place the Appellant outside of Somalia in 2014. However, in a case such as this, where establishing his identity depends so greatly on the credibility of his own testimony, the Appellant's resort to using fraudulent documents in Canada is very damaging to his overall credibility. The Appellant has demonstrated that he is willing to obtain and present false documents to authorities as it suits him.\nEvidence in support of the Appellant's declared identity\n[32] The Minister argued that if the RPD were to determine that the Kenyan documents were fraudulent, there would be no logical way that it could place weight on any other documents presented by the Appellant.16 The Appellant submits that the Minister's intervention indeed commanded the RPD's assessment and that it treated it as dispositive of the entire claim. I do not agree with that characterization. Rather than simply dismissing the rest of the evidence outright, the RPD correctly proceeded to address each remaining piece of evidence individually to examine the credibility and probative value of the documents, as well as the testimony from the Appellant's witness. I am not persuaded that the RPD took a siloed approach or that it failed to see how each piece of evidence fit a larger picture that established the Appellant's identity in the end.\n[33] The Appellant relied on the following evidence in support of his identity:\n* An affidavit from the Appellant's mother, sworn in Nairobi, along with evidence about a Somali witness who accompanied her;17\n* An affidavit and oral testimony from a witness, who claimed to have met the Appellant on several occasions in 2013 and 2015 while buying XXXX from the Appellant's family;18\n* A notarized letter from the Appellant's cousin in the US;19\n* An affidavit from the Appellant's relative in XXXX, along with a copy of the author's Somali passport;20\n* A sworn declaration from the Appellant's paternal aunt in Kismayo, along with a copy of her Somali passport;21 and\n* A letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX.22\n[34] The RPD considered this evidence, but as the panel noted in its decision, some of the evidence was deficient in several ways, and the Appellant did not take reasonable steps to establish his identity. There was much stronger evidence that the Appellant could have produced in support of his declared identity, but he chose not to present it to the RPD. Ultimately, the evidence that was presented was insufficient to credibly establish the Appellant's identity.\nEvidence from the Appellant's mother\n[35] The affidavit purporting to be from the Appellant's mother indicated that she is the Appellant's biological mother and that he was born on XXXX XXXX, 1983 in XXXX village in Somalia. She confirms the Appellant's citizenship, clan membership, religion, his being the eldest of XXXX children, as well as the circumstances around his departure from Somalia. The Appellant's mother is undocumented, and so she had someone to accompany her to swear the affidavit, who vouched for her identity. Direct evidence from the Appellant's closest family members, who knew him for his entire life and who could easily speak to his identity and background, could only have had very high probative value.\n[36] In this case, however, the RPD was not willing to simply accept the contents of this affidavit without testing its credibility. The RPD noted that the witness who vouched for the mother's identity possessed an identity document - a Somali passport - which was not signed.23 The RPD also commented on how the affidavit was silent on other issues, such as the Appellant's stay in XXXX in 2014 and the family's movements around that time. The Appellant argues that the RPD was overly critical of his evidence, and dismissed it due to technicalities, such as the lack of signature and the lack of information about specific events.\n[37] I disagree with the Appellant. The onus rested with the Appellant to establish his identity, but the evidence from those best positioned to speak to his identity was insufficient. The Appellant's mother and several of his siblings, including an adult brother, were living in Nairobi. They owned a smartphone and used WhatsApp to communicate with the Appellant. When asked why his mother did not appear as a witness for his hearing, which was held virtually, the Appellant responded that his mother's capability was low. He also stated that his brother was not called as a witness because as a person from the countryside, he was not comfortable. The RPD correctly found that this was not a reasonable explanation. Despite her supposedly low capability, the Appellant's mother was able to swear an affidavit with a notary and witness in Nairobi. The brother's comfort level also does not reasonably explain why he could not have acted as a witness. The mother's affidavit did not address the credibility issues that arose in the claim, such as whether the family was living nomadically or semi-nomadically as XXXX XXXX. Given this context, the affidavit was incapable of overcoming the credibility issues in the Appellant's claim.\n[38] I am also not persuaded that the RPD fixated on minor technicalities. The RPD questioned the reliability of the mother's statement, given that there were doubts around her own identity witness' identification. The lack of a signature in the witness' Somali passport was not an isolated issue. This was a pattern in the evidence. It was unusual that none of the Somali passports from any of the sources supporting the Appellant's identity were signed. The Appellant's Kenyan driver's licence was also unsigned. Even an affidavit that was supposedly sworn by the Appellant's aunt in Kismayo at a district court was somehow completed without any signature from her. This raised questions not just about the legal validity of the documents, but also about their authenticity. The RPD was correct to doubt the reliability of the mother's affidavit, due to the lack of reliable means to confirm her identity and the Appellant's failure to call either her or his adult brother as a witness.\nOral testimony and affidavit from the Appellant's identity witness\n[39] Rather than presenting witnesses who were best positioned to speak to his identity, the Appellant chose to present a single identity witness during the proceedings, who was someone with far less familiarity with his life and background. The identity witness was not from the Appellant's village, but he stated that he and his father traveled to the Appellant's village on several occasions between 2013 and 2015 to buy XXXX XXXX XXXX from the Appellant's family. He stated that their fathers were very good friends, and that they were from the same clan. The Appellant and his identity witness reconnected in 2019 when they met at a Somali organization in Toronto.24\n[40] The RPD found that the witness' testimony was not consistent with the Appellant's evidence. The two claimed that they knew each other because of their business relationship buying and sellingXXXX XXXX, but the RPD found that there were discrepancies around this, as they did not give consistent testimony about how much the XXXX cost, and the witness denied that the Appellant's family was nomadic. The Appellant submits that there was no material inconsistency. He argues that the RPD misapprehended his evidence, and that the inconsistency in the price of XXXX is attributable to his witness' lack of knowledge.\n[41] I have reviewed the evidence and I conclude that the witness did not know the Appellant in Somalia. The RPD did not misapprehend the evidence. The Appellant now attempts to describe his family as \"semi-nomadic\", but that was not his testimony at the RPD. In explaining his family's movements during his time in XXXX, the Appellant testified that they were moving from place to place, not necessarily because of problems with Al-Shabaab, but because his family was nomadic. The RPD attempted to understand how the Appellant knew where to return to find his family when he returned from XXXX. In response to this, the Appellant described that, as with other nomadic families, there was a system of locating, such that when you returned to town, you could ask for your family, and they would tell you where they had relocated. He stated that moving was normal to them, and that he did not even think to mention his family's movements during his time in XXXX because they were constantly moving so that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as was their lifestyle. By contrast, the identity witness stated that the Appellant's family were simply XXXX XXXX, and that they only stayed in one area, and did not move to any other places. And so, he explained, there was only one place that he would ever meet them, and he knew where to go and find them. The Appellant has not been able to reconcile this inconsistency.\n[42] The RPD also correctly found that the Appellant and his witness gave very different testimony about the prices of XXXX. The Appellant testified that he sold XXXX for about 2 million Somali shillings. The identity witness stated that a XXXX would cost him 800,000 shillings, and that the most he ever paid was 1.1 million shillings. When this inconsistency was put to the Appellant, he blamed his witness' ignorance, and claimed that he knew XXXX better than his witness. He stated that his price for XXXX could go down to 1.8 or 1.5 million shillings. The identity witness did indicate that he was merely approximating in his answers, and he did clarify that his father was the primary broker for the family, but the difference here is considerable. There are 400,000 Somali shillings between the lowest end of the Appellant's range, and the highest end of his witness' range, which amounts to roughly $1000 CAD. That is a significant sum by Somali standards, where estimates for GDP per capita range between $284 and $500 USD and where about 70% of the population lived on under $1.90 USD per day.25 The witness stated that his father was an XXXX XXXX, whose business it was to purchase XXXX and then sell at higher prices. The family made their money from the difference in those prices, and so one would reasonably expect that knowledge of prices would have been very important. The witness stated that he was not in partnership with his father, but that as the firstborn son in the family, he was most definitely involved in the business and understood the day-to-day of his father's business very well.\n[43] The inconsistencies in the testimony are not reasonably explained, and they significantly undermine the Appellant's allegations about how he knew his witness. I conclude that the Appellant and his witness likely did not know each other in Somalia as alleged, and I find that this further undermines the Appellant's credibility with respect to his identity, especially given that this was the only identity witness that was presented at any of the RPD hearings.\nNotarized letter from the Appellant's cousin in the US\n[44] The Appellant provided a notarized letter from someone in the US who claimed to be his cousin on his father's side. The author of the letter states that the Appellant came to stay with him in the US after his release from detention in XXXX 2018.26 The RPD gave this document some weight, but it was unclear how the author had confirmed the Appellant's personal and national identity. The RPD again noted that the author was not presented as a witness, and therefore there were aspects of his evidence that could not be tested, and there was no opportunity to address gaps in the affidavit, such as how the Appellant arrived in the US and the author's knowledge of the Appellant's possible status elsewhere.\n[45] I see no error in the RPD's treatment of this document. The RPD did not dismiss this evidence outright simply because it was one piece of a larger evidentiary picture, nor did the RPD reject it based on technicalities. The RPD correctly assessed the document's probative value. The author may have facilitated the Appellant's release from detention in the US, but he did not say how he was able to ascertain the Appellant's identity. There is no information about whether the two knew each other in Somalia, nor how they were put in contact with each other. Even in conjunction with the other evidence, the document is insufficient to establish the Appellant's identity.\nAffidavit from the Appellant's relative in XXXX\n[46] The RPD placed little weight on the affidavit from the Appellant's relative, who swore an affidavit in Nairobi in support of his refugee claim. This was the same relative with whom the Appellant stayed in XXXX. The RPD noted that the relative's Somali passport was unsigned, and therefore it was invalid. This made the RPD doubt the reliability of the affidavit, and the panel also found the contents of the affidavit to be vague and insufficient.\n[47] I agree with the RPD. The author of the affidavit states that he is the uncle of the Appellant's mother. He confirms that he is a Somali citizen and a businessman who resides in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He states that he often travels between Somalia and Kenya. Though it was this relative who supposedly arranged for the Appellant to obtain a Kenyan driver's licence, and also sent the driver's licence and confirmation letter to the Appellant, the affidavit mentions nothing about how these arrangements were made. The author merely states that he offered to assist the Appellant \"in any way\" to get a driver's licence.27 It is unusual that despite his regular travel between Somalia and Kenya, the author's Somali passport is unsigned, like all the other copies of Somali passports that were disclosed. I also find that the author's credibility is directly impugned, given that it is this individual who assisted the Appellant in obtaining fraudulent Kenyan documents to facilitate the Appellant's application for a driver's licence in Ontario. I place no weight on his affidavit and the photocopy of his passport.\nSworn declaration from the Appellant's paternal aunt in Kismayo\n[48] The RPD also placed little weight on the affidavit supposedly sworn by the Appellant's paternal aunt in Kismayo. The document was printed on letterhead from the Kismayo District Court, but it was unclear who completed the document with the affiant, as the name of the individual who signed it did not indicate whether they were a commissioner, a notary, or someone else authorized by the court to complete affidavits. In addition, the affidavit contained no signature, nor any thumbprint from the affiant. The affiant claimed that she made annual visits to see the Appellant's family in XXXX, and that she stopped visiting in 2016, but there was little detail about how she was able to complete these visits in the context of the physical dangers on the roads in this part of Somalia. In addition, the affiant stated that the Appellant left Somalia in XXXX 2018, but the Appellant's evidence was that he left in XXXX 2017. There were also other gaps in her statement, such as information about the risks faced by the Appellant and his family.\n[49] I place no weight on the aunt's affidavit and passport copy. The Appellant argues that commissioning errors go to weight, and do not automatically invalidate the contents of a statement, but as mentioned, the issues mentioned by the RPD are not just about the legal validity of the affidavit. The issues clearly bear on the authenticity of the documents. When questioned about how he obtained the affidavit from his aunt, the Appellant described that she and her son were able to find a notary to complete the document. He explained that his aunt's son was an educated person and that his aunt was a businesswoman, and that they had the means to pay for an affidavit. However, as pointed out by the RPD, there is no information in the affidavit to indicate that it was completed by a notary. It was printed on the letterhead of a district court, but it is unclear whether it was completed by a notary, a commissioner, a judge, or some other member of the court's staff. It strikes me as unlikely that such a document would be completed in a court without ever being signed by the affiant. And, again, it is unusual that the affiant's passport, like the others, is still unsigned despite being issued two years before the affidavit was completed. I am not satisfied that the affidavit and passport copy are genuine documents.\nLetter from XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[50] Finally, the Appellant provided a support letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, a settlement organization in Toronto. The organization interviewed the Appellant and his identity witness. They confirmed that the Appellant speaks Somali fluently, that he was able to accurately characterize the geography of his place of origin, and that he could identify the province in which his hometown was located. The organization found that the Appellant's dialect was consistent with Standard Somali and that his physical features were like those of the majority of ethnic Somalis, including members of his clan. They believed that, due to this, there was a very strong likelihood that the Appellant is a Somali citizen.\n[51] The RPD disagreed with the organization's conclusions. It found that these factors did not establish the Appellant's nationality as a Somali. The letter did not include details about the kinds of questions asked, which would have been helpful in assessing whether they were truly probative of the Appellant's origins in Somalia. The organization also did not adequately explain how they were able to verify the Appellant's personal identity.\n[52] The Appellant disputes the RPD's treatment of this evidence, citing the Federal Court's decision in Warsame.28 He submits that the RPD should have considered the evidence as a whole, rather than dismissing the XXXX letter simply because it was one part of a larger picture. According to the Appellant, even though the letter may not have been particularly probative of the Appellant's personal identity, it did support his national identity. The Appellant also says that it was unfair for the RPD to take issue with the lack of detail in the letter about the organization's assessment methods. The Appellant says that by not giving him the opportunity to address this issue, the RPD denied him a fair chance to respond to a credibility concern.\n[53] I disagree with the Appellant. The letter attempted to address both the Appellant's national and personal identity, by referring to an interview with an identity witness, who claimed to be able to confirm the Appellant's personal identity, as well as factors that supported his national identity. However, the letter had little probative value in establishing either aspect of the Appellant's identity. The organization was not acquainted with the Appellant prior to his arrival in Canada, and the identity witness that they interviewed was the very same individual who testified at the RPD, whom the RPD found was not a credible witness.\n[54] In addition, factors such as the Appellant's language abilities and his knowledge of Somali culture and history are clearly factors that establish his ethnicity as Somali, but they are not determinative of his nationality. As the Minister noted in their intervention, there is a significant population of ethnic Somalis living in Kenya who are Kenyan citizens, rather than citizens of Somalia.29 I note that there are also significant populations of ethnic Somalis in Ethiopia, Djibouti, and elsewhere, who do not possess Somali citizenship.30 The documentary evidence indicates that the traditional Somali ethnic homeland crosses nation-state borders, and the Somali diaspora population was one of the largest proportional diaspora populations in the world.31 It is possible for ethnic Somalis who are citizens of other countries to speak Somali fluently, to have knowledge about Somali culture, history, clan lineage, and even a basic knowledge of Somali geography.\n[55] The RPD was correct to discount the evidence because of the lack of detail regarding the organization's assessment methods. This was not a credibility issue that had to be put to the Appellant for an explanation, as a matter of procedural fairness. The RPD never doubted whether XXXX truly interviewed the Appellant. The issue here is around the probative value of the letter. The RPD was merely assessing the capacity of the evidence to establish the fact of which it was offered in proof.32 It should not have come as any surprise to the Appellant that the RPD would examine the evidence and weigh it. The RPD correctly considered that, without more information about the questions that were asked of the Appellant, it could not reach the same conclusions as the organization on the Appellant's origins in Somalia. A depth of knowledge about the village of XXXX and the surrounding area could have been probative in establishing his origins there, but the letter gave almost no details about what was asked. In my view, the Appellant's ability to identify XXXX as a village in the Lower Juba region is not particularly compelling evidence of his origins. Without more, I also place little weight on this letter in establishing the Appellant's national identity, and I give it no weight in establishing his personal identity.\nSufficiency of evidence\n[56] After considering the entirety of the evidence, I am not satisfied that the Appellant has established his national or personal identity on a balance of probabilities. The Appellant was not a credible witness, and he demonstrated that he was willing to obtain and use fraudulent documents at his convenience. The Appellant had an abundance of time to corroborate his declared identity, but he did not present evidence that was reasonably available to him, such as witness testimony from his mother or his brother from Nairobi. This would have been relatively simple to do, given their access to a mobile phone and the internet, in proceedings that were taking place virtually through Microsoft Teams. The only identity witness that was presented was from someone who claimed to have befriended the Appellant in Somalia between 2013 and 2015, but his testimony was not credible. There were issues with the credibility, reliability, and probative value of much of the other evidence. Under these circumstances, I find that the RPD was correct to conclude that the Appellant had not provided sufficient credible evidence to establish his identity.\nCONCLUSION\n[57] Therefore, although I do not agree with all of the RPD's findings, I have reached the same conclusion about the Appellant's failure to establish his identity. This issue is dispositive of the Appellant's refugee claim. I confirm the RPD's negative decision. I am unable to find that the Appellant is either a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nMatthew Oh\nMatthew Oh\nApril 4, 2023\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant), XXXX XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellant), XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX (Minor Associate Appellants) appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting their claims for refugee protection on August 19, 2022. The Principal Appellant (PA), Associate Appellant (AA), and Minor Associate Appellants (MAAs) are citizens of Nigeria. The PA, AA and MAAs will collectively be referred to as the Appellants. The Appellants fear the PA's extended family members and the Obagie community. The determinative issue for the RPD was credibility. For the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), the determinative issue is an internal flight alternative (IFA). The Appellants have not met their burden of demonstrating the IFA is not viable in all their circumstances. The appeal therefore must fail.\n[2] Given the nature of this claim, I have considered and applied the Chairperson's Guideline 4 - Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board (Gender Guideline).1 When I consider and apply the Gender Guideline to the circumstances of the MAAs, female daughters allegedly facing circumcision, the Appellants have not credibly established their claims and there is an IFA reasonably available to them.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD, for other reasons, that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[4] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2\nBACKGROUND\n[5] Based on the Basis of Claim (BOC), narratives and the 2019 and 2021 oral testimony, the following serves as a background of this appeal. The PA is the chosen heir for the Priest Craft called \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" who is considered to be the oracle who communicates with gods and deities. The Appellants' supporting documents spell this position as \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" and this term has been used in the RPD reasons for decision. For consistency, I will use that spelling instead of \"XXXX\" (as spelled in the BOC narrative) in this decision. The PA's uncle (his father's older brother), XXXX XXXX, was the current XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time of these events and had become ill, prompting his community to approach the PA to prepare him to take over the position as XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Appellants allege that the PA was chosen to be the next XXXX XXXX XXXX and that entails him engaging in barbaric rituals of which he refuses to do, and his Christian religion does not support. Also, the MAAs, daughters, would have to undergo circumcision which both parents, the PA and AA, refused. They left Nigeria in XXXX 2018 fearing they would be forced by the agents of persecution to engage and be subjected to these traditional practices. They initially went to the United States of America (US) and later came to Canada where they filed their refugee claims.\nRPD REASONS FOR REFUSAL\n[6] The RPD focused on the credibility of their basis of claim and refused their claims on this issue.\nAPPELLANTS GROUNDS FOR APPEAL\n[7] The Appellants argue the RPD's decision was incorrect. They submit that the RPD failed to consider the Gender Guideline, failed to consider the entirety of the evidence presented, erred by not accepting supporting documents, relied on minor inconsistencies and undertook a microscopic analysis of the evidence. While the RPD mentioned it considered the Gender Guideline, I fail to understand how it applied it in its reasons for decision. Furthermore, I note that the Appellants themselves did not present arguments related to the Gender Guideline to the RPD. I acknowledge the evidence is such that the MAAs as alleged would face circumcision is a gender issue and will consider and apply the Gender Guideline when assessing their claims under the determinative issue of IFA.\n[8] I reject the argument that the RPD did not accept or allow the Appellants the right to file additional information and documents, this is contrary to the evidence before me. Namely, the RPD allowed additional documentary evidence filed by the Appellants as seen in the Consolidated List of Document (CLOD)- De Novo3 and the RPD transcript of its proceedings on September 15, 2021.4 As such, I will not consider the Appellants' arguments as they are not supported by the evidence before me nor have, they filed any new evidence to consider at the RAD.\nRAD FINDS DETERMINATIVE ISSUE TO BE IFA\n[9] The RPD also considered whether the Appellants would have an IFA in Port Harcourt or Abuja. They were questioned on the IFA issue, responded and they were given the opportunity to make submissions on that issue as well. As this is not a new issue, I therefore do not need to give notice to the parties when considering all the evidence before me when concluding that the IFA is determinative at appeal. Based on the facts of the Appellants before me, regardless of the credibility of their claims, the Appellants have an IFA for the reasons outlined below.\nANALYSIS\nIFA\n[10] I have considered the testimony of the PA and AA, and the fact that the PA was the designated representative for the MAAs, and all the documentation before me to conduct an independent assessment of the claims, considering the arguments on appeal.\n[11] At the hearing, the RPD identified Abuja and Port Harcourt as possible IFAs but dismissed their claims on credibility only. When considering the evidence, the determinative issue for RAD is IFA. I applied the two-prong test for IFA5 to determine if there is a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm in the proposed IFAs and whether the conditions in the proposed IFAs are such that it would not be unreasonable to move there, considering the specific circumstances of the Appellants.\nAppellants would not face serious possibility of persecution in the IFAs\n[12] There can only be a serious possibility of persecution if the agents of persecution have both the means and the motivation to search for and pursue the Appellant. When considering the evidence there is insufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the PA's community have the means, resources, or capacity to find the Appellants in Abuja and Port Harcourt. They have not demonstrated that they face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFAs.\n[13] The AA testified that she did not think their family was safe in either IFA proposed by the RPD because [the PA's] family member they are in top --- they are in government positions that they can easily get to us at any given time. Even while [they] were in Lagos there [they] didn't go out, [they] were indoor. It was XXXX that used to go out and get us food and every other thing that we need because they are everywhere in the country.6 She also testified that she was personally at risk because [the agents of persecution] are going to kill [her] because they will think --- they think or they know that probably [herself] and [her] husband are the one preventing them to carry out the first rites on which for them to --- which is for them to circumcise the [MAAs], because [she's] the mother, probably they will know that maybe the mother doesn't want such thing to happen to the child. So, they will think [she] is the main person planning for [them] to disappear or for [them] to escape. So that's why [she] thinks that [she] will be at a very big risk.7 She also confirmed that while in Lagos for five months at XXXX home, no one came looking for them.8 She confirmed she was speculating that had they gone out or move around the neighbourhood in Lagos maybe [they] would have sighted one or two persons that could recognize [them].9\n[14] The PA testified that the agents of persecution would stop at nothing to find them but agreed with the AA's testimony. He also testified that his family are among the wealthiest and have connections10 but failed to provide any supporting evidence to support his testimony.\n[15] The Appellants have failed to demonstrate their agents of persecution have the means and motivation to locate the Appellants in Port Harcourt and Abuja. There is no evidence on the file about the positions that the AA's husband's family has like government wise or in the police. I have also considered the oral testimony of the PA at the most recent RPD hearing that his family came with the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) when they sealed the PA's father's home and that the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" also have his own special killing squad.11 I note that this evidence that the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" have a special killing squad was never mentioned in the first RPD hearing and the Appellants have not filed any documentary evidence to support the SARS were involved when his agents of persecution were looking for his father, nor did the father's affidavit which is in evidence.12 In addition, the picture that allegedly shows the priest alone sealing the home and there are no SARS agents present.13 The Appellants have failed to meet their burden in demonstrating that the agents of persecution have the means and motivation to find them. Furthermore, given the AA and MAAs were in Lagos for approximately 5 months without anyone coming to find them, despite allegedly remaining indoors except to get their US visas, the agents of persecution did not have the means or motivation to look for the AA and MAAs during that period of time in Lagos.\n[16] I find that the Appellants have not provided sufficient evidence to show that their agents of persecution have the power, influence and means to locate them in the IFAs. The Appellant therefore fails on the first prong of the IFA test. The Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFAs.\nPort Harcourt and Abuja are viable alternatives for the Appellants\n[17] Port Harcourt and Abuja are a viable alternative for the Appellants, and they have not met their high burden of demonstrating otherwise. As such the IFA test also fails on the second prong of the test for the following reasons.\n[18] Regarding why they could not live in the IFAs, the AA testified14 they could not live in either IFAs because they do not having anyone living in these places; they speak different languages and it's a different cultures; they would not have peace of mind and the fear of insecurity going on everywhere killing and kidnapping, \"you\" can't move freely, \"you\" can't stay on [their] own without watching \"your\" back; \"you\" can't walk on the streets without thinking you might be kidnapped or be shot dead or be hit by a car or be robbed. The AA also indicated that here in Canada \"you\" don't have such, \"you\" move freely, \"you\" are happy, \"you\" have friends around, make friends, and a lot of good people. The AA also agreed her reasons given were generalized and could happen to anybody.15\n[19] When asked by the RPD if the MAAs could go to school and get an education in the IFAs, the AA said they could not because \"probably they are not from the state and don't have the native name\" for the reason they will not be accepted in the schools. She further added she knew this for sure as a lot of people end up taking the kids to school or they end up having poor education for the kids.\n[20] When asked by the RPD if they could access healthcare, the AA testified they would be denied healthcare in the IFAs because of their names and they are not a native of those areas and speculated again about having to go to the private hospital and \"you\" can end up having the kids get into maybe severe sickness as well.\n[21] When asked by the RPD if they could get accommodations, the AA said they could not because of their background, where they are from, the language \"you\" speak, and due to family background checks. Adding that if \"you\" are not from there, they treat that person as an outcast.16\n[22] When asked whether one or the other, Port Harcourt or Abuja, may be better for the Appellants to live, the AA testified they are the same.17\n[23] The PA was given the opportunity to add anything or elaborate on the AAs testimony regarding the IFAs and he testified that everything she said is true regarding the IFAs.18\n[24] According to the objective evidence before the RPD,19 the IFAs are both large urban centres, easily accessible, access to housing, work, education, and health services. Based on their personal profiles, the Appellants speak English, a language commonly used in both IFAs, along with other dialects. Given the PA and AA's education and proven ability to adapt to new environments, they have not convinced me that the MAAs would not be able to get an education and also adapt in the IFAs. There is a difference between being allowed to go to school and having cultural differences from others attending school which the Appellants have not proven the MAAs would face any issues because of their names.\n[25] The Appellants have failed to demonstrate that the IFAs are not a viable alternative for them. Based on their personal circumstances, the PA is in his mid 40s and the AA is in her mid 30s both with XXXX education and work experience in Benin, Lagos, and outside of Nigeria. They have transferrable work experience to bring back to the IFAs. They all speak English, which is an official language of Nigeria; they identify with Christianity as do a large population of Nigeria. Abuja is an urban city with diverse ethnic and religious populations so their name and cultural background would not negatively impact them living there. Urban centres such as the IFAs in this appeal have medical care which is also contrary to their testimony.\n[26] Thought the Appellants have not pointed me to how the Gender Guideline impacts their personal circumstances, turning my mind to the Gender Guideline, I fail to see how the AA and the MAAs gender-related circumstances would lead me to conclude that the IFAs would be unreasonable. The PA and AA have clearly stated that they do not support the MAAs being circumcised, a choice they have as the MAAs' parents to refuse circumcision being performed on their children. The Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) in Nigeria (2015) prohibits female genital mutilation (FGM) and the Child Rights Act (2009) in River State (Abuja) sets out that any person who directly or indirectly causes a female child to be subjected to FGM is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding 50,000 Naira or imprisonment for a term of one year, or both.20 I have also considered section 11.6 of the Gender Guideline and find the Appellants have not bet their burden in demonstrating that an IFA does not exist in their personal circumstances.\n[27] Overall, the Appellants have not met their burden in demonstrating, on the balance of probabilities, that it would be objectively unreasonable for them to relocate to Port Harcourt or Abuja. They do not meet the second prong of the IFA test.\nRAD's conclusion of the IFA analysis\n[28] Based on my independent assessment of the evidence, the Appellants have a viable IFA in Port Harcourt and Abuja. I also find that the Appellants have failed to discharge the burden of showing with clear and convincing evidence that the proposed IFAs are unreasonable or unduly harsh.\n[29] As the Appellants have a viable IFA in the city of Port Harcourt and Abuja, they do not face a serious forward-looking risk of persecution in Nigeria. Their claims therefore fail.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD, for other reasons, that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJulie Ryan\nJulie Ryan\nJanuary 19, 2023\nDate\n1 Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the IRPA, July 18, 2022.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated September 13, 2022, rejecting their claim for refugee protection.\n[3] The Principal Appellant acts as a Designated Representative for the Minor Appellant.\n[4] The Principal Appellant's allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form,1 narrative2 and amendment.3 The Associate and Minor Appellant both rely on the narrative of their husband and father for the basis of their claims. In short, the Principal Appellant alleges that he was previously a supporter of the Congress Party and in XXXX of 2016, he became a supporter of the Aam Aadmni Party (AAP) in Punjab. After his defection to AAP, the Principal Appellant began to receive threats from Congress Party goons and his local Sarpanch. In 2017, he was detained by police on false drug charges and four months later his wheat field was leveled by fire. He alleges that unknown parties are trying to kill him and after he fled to Delhi, he obtained assistance from an agent and came to Canada in XXXX of 2018. The Appellants fear they will be harmed should they return to India due to their connections with the AAP.\n[5] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellants' claims on the basis that they have access to a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata.\n[6] The Appellants submit the following:\na) The RPD erred in finding that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata.4\n[7] The Appellants have not provided any new evidence for the purpose of their appeal.\n[8] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.5 The RPD found that the Appellants have failed to establish that the agents of persecution would be able to or, are motivated to find the Appellants. The RPD found insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellants would face undue hardship in the proposed IFA.\n[9] Having reviewed all the evidence in the case, I find that the Appellants have failed to establish that he does not have a viable IFA in Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata.\nANALYSIS OF MERITS OF APPEAL\nAppellants have a viable IFA in Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata\n[10] At the outset of the hearing, the RPD identified IFA as a potential issue and the locations of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata were noted. The RPD Member found that IFA was the determinative issue and rejected the Appellants' claims for refugee protection based on the availability of a viable IFA in all three locations. I am not persuaded by the Appellants' argument that the RPD erred in its IFA finding.\n[11] After an independent review of the RPD Record and the transcript of the RPD hearing, I also find that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. I have considered the totality of the evidence and find that there is not a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellants in the IFA location, nor is it unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to the proposed location.\n[12] In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, I have considered the two-prong test from Thirunavukkarasu.6 I must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the Appellants being persecuted in the part of the country in which an IFA exists. Furthermore, conditions in that part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, to seek refuge there. The Appellants bear the burden of proof to show that he would be persecuted under one of the Convention grounds, or be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of India, and specifically in the potential IFA locations of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. I find that the Appellants have not met this burden.\n[13] International refugee protection is surrogate (that is, substitute) protection that only comes into play if a claimant does not have an IFA in their country of citizenship. The onus is on the Appellants to demonstrate that they do not have a viable IFA in their home country. In other words, a location to which they could relocate where they could live without experiencing persecution or the kind of serious harm that would make them persons in need of protection. The IFA analysis contains two prongs:7\n1) The decision maker must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Appellants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA location or a likelihood that they would be subjected personally to one of the types of harm that would make them persons in need of protection there.\n2) The conditions in the part of the country under consideration must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the Appellants to seek refuge there. The threshold for unreasonableness is a very high one and requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.8\nFirst prong of the IFA test\n[14] I do not agree with counsel's submission that the Appellants would not have a viable IFA in India due to who the agent of persecution is, as well as their access to the tenant verification system, police databases, or the Central Monitoring System.\n[15] As the Federal Court has made clear, the question of whether an IFA exists is a factual one and documentary evidence may be insufficient to substantiate a refugee claim if the claimant does not establish a connection between the evidence and their specific situation.9 As noted above, the Principal Appellant alleges that he is still of interest to the Congress party goons, as they the police and the Sarpanch continue to inquire about his whereabouts with his parents.10 He states that his family will be tracked wherever he was to live in India because of the Congress party's link to the police.\n[16] When the RPD asked the Principal Appellant how he would be located in Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata, he stated they would locate him when he attempted to rent a place to live.11 He testified that he would be required to use his identification to put his children in school or for tenant verification.12\n[17] I find that the Principal Appellant's assertions regarding the alleged motivation of the agents of persecution to track him down and seriously harm him in the IFA cities to be speculative. There was no evidence, beyond his own assertions, to support his claim that the police, Congress party members or Sarpanch would have the motivation to expend the time and resources to track him down in the IFA city if the family was to relocate there, some four years after their departure from India. The Appellants did file two documents claiming that the police continue to ask about the Appellants in their home area.13 I find that the general assertions in the affidavits are insufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that the police would have the motivation to track down the Appellants in Delhi Mumbai or Kolkata, especially when there is no warrant for the Principal Appellant's arrest, nor is he wanted for an alleged crime. Furthermore, the Appellants did flee to Delhi after the fire in XXXX of 2018 and did not provide any evidence that they had any difficulty with the agents of persecution during their four months in that city. Furthermore, their daughter remains in the familial home and has not encountered any issues during their absence.\n[18] The Appellants argue that agents of persecution would be able to locate them through the tenant registration system or Aadhar card. Upon my review of the RPD Record and the transcript of the hearing, I note that the Principal Appellant has never been charged with a crime, and to his knowledge, no First Information Report (FIR) has been filed against him and he was permitted to depart India on his own passport from an international airport. He did not indicate that he is pro-Khalistan and in fact denies any political involvement with separatist groups.\n[19] Moreover, the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India indicates that there is minimal interstate police communication, except for cases of \"major crime\" like smuggling, terrorism and some high-profile organized crime.14 The evidence in this case, if accepted, would establish that the police illegally detained and assaulted the Principal Appellant based on the fact that he is no longer a Congress Party supporter. While it appears that the Principal Appellant was detained illegally, the evidence in this case does not establish that the Appellants are involved in the kind of major crime that would motivate the police to engage in interstate communications to track down and seriously harm the Appellants in the IFA cities.\n[20] For these reasons, I find that the Principal Appellant has failed to establish that it is more likely than not that the agents of persecution have the motivation to track them down and seriously harm the Appellants in the IFA cities.\nNo likelihood of means to track the Appellant\n[21] I disagree with counsel that it is more likely than not that the agents of persecution would have the means to track the Principal Appellant down and subject him to serious harm in the IFA cities.\n[22] In my view, the NDP for India indicates that the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) is in use in an increasing number of police stations and that there is a mandatory system of tenant verification in India.15 However, the evidence on both of these is mixed. For example, the evidence indicates that there are insufficient resources to follow up on all tenant verification forms due to the volume of internal migration within India.16 In addition, the documentary evidence notes that police systems between districts and states are not integrated, thus \"police stations in India still work in silos as far as criminal information is concerned\" and despite being connected to CCTNS \"police officers on duty still continue with their old ways for registering complaints and FIRS on paper.\"17 Moreover, the evidence in the NDP for India indicates that there is little interstate police communication, except in cases of major crimes like smuggling, terrorism, and some high-profile organized crime.\n[23] During the hearing, the Principal Appellant testified that no FIR was filed in his name and that he was not subject to a criminal case. He was able to leave the country on a passport, issued in his own name. In my view, the evidence in this case does not establish that it is more likely than not that the police entered the Principal Appellant's name and information in any police databases. I also note that the Executive Director of the South Asia Terrorism Portal and the Institute for Conflict Management are quoted in the research report contained in item 10.13 of the NDP as stating that \"no official record of [extrajudicial] arrests is maintained\" in official criminal databases.18\n[24] In making my decision, I must weigh all the circumstances surrounding the Principal Appellant's interactions with the police and whether his name likely appears in police databases such as the CCTNS database. In this case, the police never charged the Principal Appellant, nor is there any evidence that they filled out an FIR. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the police issued an arrest warrant to arrest the Principal Appellant.\n[25] When all of this evidence is weighed, I do not find that the Appellants have met their onus of establishing that it is more likely than not that the police entered their names into the CCTNS database. Therefore, they have not established that the police likely would have the means to locate them through the tenant registration process, as any likelihood of tracking the Appellants through that process would likely be linked to the CCTNS database.\n[26] The Appellants also argue they could be located through the Aadhaar card. As outlined by the RPD, the Aadhaar card is a 12-digit number issued to Indian nationals and is used to establish identity and obtain services such as education, healthcare and employment.19 The objective documentary evidence establishes that the data from the Aadhaar card is tightly controlled. This information isn't available in police databases, there is legislation preventing the sharing of the data and must be obtained by court order from a higher court.20 While the Appellants allege that the agents of persecution would be able to access this information, they have failed to establish how they would gain this access.\n[27] For all the above reasons, I find that the Appellants have failed to establish that it is more likely than not that the police or political goons would have either the motivation or the means to track them down and torture, kill or seriously harm the family in Delhi Mumbai or Kolkata.\nSecond prong of the IFA test\nThe proposed IFA location is reasonable\n[28] I have also considered the second prong of the IFA test, in light of the Appellants' personal circumstances. The panel is mindful that the Federal Court of Appeal has set a high threshold for the unreasonableness prong of the IFA test. Indeed, \"it requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\"21 The Federal Court of Appeal has also been clear that the personal circumstances of a claimant must be central to the reasonableness analysis.22\n[29] In assessing whether Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata are reasonable IFA locations, I have considered the Appellants' ability to travel safely to the IFA and to stay there without facing undue hardship.\n[30] In relation to the Appellants' argument that they are dealing with an agent of persecution who will find him anywhere in India, I have already found that this has not been established by the evidence. The Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the means to locate them throughout India. The Appellants have argued that the IFA is unreasonable because they will be located through school registration, I do not find that this allegation has been established.\n[31] I note the Principal Appellant has a XXXX XXXX education in India, his wife has completed grade XXXX. The Principal Appellant has worked as a XXXX and the Associate Appellant was a XXXX.23 The Appellants have also lived in Canada for over four years and have adapted to a country that was unknown to them. The Principal Appellant has worked as a XXXX since his arrival in Canada. The Appellants provided little testimony at the RPD hearing about what difficulties they would face in the proposed IFA locations, other than that they don't know anyone in the area. I note that the preferences or convenience of the Appellants are not relevant in considering the IFA.\n[32] I find given the Principal Appellant's education and work experience and his ability to adapt to a new location that he would, on a balance of probabilities, be able to find employment and have a stable source of income in the proposed IFA location. The Appellants are practicing Sikhs. The documents note that there are approximately 20 million Sikhs in India. Each city is a major urban centre, for example half a million Sikhs are located in Delhi.24 This would provide the Appellants a large religious community for support, if they were to choose to seek it.\n[33] The Appellants have testified they speak Punjabi. While they did not allege that language would be a barrier, I do note the family has been living and functioning in an English-speaking province for over four years now. I am not satisfied that the Appellants have established that they meet the threshold required to demonstrate that relocating to the IFA location would be unreasonable or unduly harsh, having regard to all his circumstances.\n[34] The RPD also considered the Appellants' allegations that the police and Congress goons continue to visit their home in India and ask about there whereabouts. It was also mindful that not being able to disclose information on one's location with your extended network is tantamount to requiring someone to live in hiding. I agree with the panel's analysis that this is not a situation where the Appellants would be cut off from their families, and could visit with their families outside their home village.\n[35] The Appellants have made other submissions specifically regarding hardship they could face as returnees with expired passports. I note that the objective documentary evidence indicates that failed asylum seekers do not appear to face mistreatment25 and another indicates \"there is no problem\" for failed refugee claimants or other deportees to India, provided that they are not accused of a crime back home.26 I do not find that the Appellants have established that they would have difficulty returning to India as failed refugee claimants with expired passports.\n[36] The Court has been clear that \"the hardship associated with relocation is not the kind that renders an IFA unreasonable.\"27 While I am sympathetic to the difficulties faced by the Appellants in relocating to another city and that there would be a period of adjustment, I do not find this renders the IFA location unreasonable in their circumstances. A finding that a viable IFA exists in India means the Appellants would be safe in the IFA location and it is reasonable for them to relocate there. The Appellants can return directly to the IFA location of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata which have international airports. Having considered all the evidence, I find that it is reasonable for the Appellants to seek refuge in Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed)\nKimberley Foreman\nKimberley Foreman\nMarch 1, 2023\nDate\n1 RPD Record, Exhibit 2.1, pp. 19-28.\n2 Ibid., pp. 29-30.\n3 Ibid., Exhibit 5, p. 128.\n4 Appellants' Record, Appellants' Memorandum, p. 9.\n5 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The appellant is a Jordanian citizen of Palestinian origins from XXXX, which is in northern Jordan on the XXXXRiver near the Israeli-Jordanian border. He appeals a Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision dated September 9, 2022, rejecting his claim for refugee protection (RPD Decision). He is requesting that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the RPD Decision and find that he is a Convention1 refugee or a person in need of protection. In the alternative, he requests that the RAD refer the matter back to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. He has requested to submit new evidence and to hold an oral hearing.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the RPD Decision that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to subsection 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2\nBACKGROUND\nBasis of Claim\n[3] The appellant is a XXXX who fears Muslim ideologues who attempted to coerce him into producing weapons for them and threatened and assaulted him for refusing. The rest of the central allegations in his claim are set in paragraphs [2], [3], [7] and [8] of the RPD Decision. In addition, Jordanian authorities caught Daesh supporters trying to smuggle weapons from Jordan into Israel in early XXXX 2022 in the XXXX area.\nRPD Decision\n[4] The RPD rejected the appellant's claim because it found that he has a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Amman.\nANALYSIS\nDeterminative Issue\n[5] The determinative issue in this appeal is whether the RPD committed critical IFA assessment errors. For the following reasons, the RAD finds that the RPD came to a correct IFA conclusion.\n[6] In rendering this decision, the RAD has reviewed a transcript of the RPD hearing and it has done an independent assessment of the record. The RAD is reviewing the RPD Decision on a standard of correctness.\nRequest for admission of new evidence allowed in part\n[7] The appellant has requested that the RAD admit several new items as new evidence, as follows: a post-RPD Decision letter from the appellant's mayor in northern Jordan about a Daesh weapons smuggling incident in that area in early XXXX 2022,3 a news article from the Jerusalem Post,4 a news article from Arab48.com,5 a Google map,6 and weblinks to other items concerning the XXXX 2022 weapons smuggling incident.7\n[8] The RAD is rejecting the Jerusalem Post article because the appellant has not produced the whole article which leaves the RAD unable to assess it.\n[9] The RAD is rejecting the weblinks to other items concerning the XXXX 2022 weapons smuggling incident because they fail RAD Rule 27 which requires that documents provided to the RAD must arrive on 8.5 x 11inch photocopies of the documents themselves and not just by weblinks to the documents somewhere else.\n[10] The Jerusalem Post news article and the weblinks and the other items to which they refer are therefore not admitted as new evidence by the RAD and are not considered in deciding this appeal.\n[11] The RAD is admitting the letter from the mayor, the Google map, and the Arab48.com article as new evidence because they both arose after the RPD Decision and because the RAD is satisfied that they are new, credible and relevant to the IFA issue for determination in this appeal.\n[12] The RAD is not convening an oral hearing because it does not have any credibility concerns regarding the new evidence that it has admitted.\nIFA First Prong\n[13] The RPD found that the appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution and does not face, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in Amman for the following reasons:8\n[11] On the evidence before it, the panel finds that there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted, or that he would be subjected on a balance of probabilities to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Amman. In this regard, the panel relies on the totality of evidence, including the simple fact that the claimant lived in Amman for more than 2 years without incident or threat to him from his agents of persecution or anyone else between XXXX XXXX, 2017 and XXXX XXXX, 2019. Further, while the claimant did testify that his agents of persecution threatened his brother [in XXXX], in late 2019 telling his sibling that they \"...would get their revenge sooner or later\", his brother was neither harmed nor had to relocate to escape these activities and overtures.\n[12] Further, while the claimant has inferentially tied his agents of persecution to ISIS (by reason of a logo appearing on a note left on his door), there is no persuasive documentary or substantive evidence before the panel that his agents of persecution were members of an organized group, or that they were working at the behest of, or networked with any larger organization which might indicate more than a mere possibility of the claimant being successfully located in Amman.\n[13] Based upon the totality of evidence, and particularly the claimant's safe relocation and residence in Amman for over 2 years following the last encounter with his agents of persecution in 2017, the panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or harmed in Amman, particularly insofar as the last contact with the claimant by his agents of persecution - albeit made indirectly through his brother [in XXXX] -occurred in late 2019 (nearly 3 years ago), without any evidence of subsequent contact.\n[14] The appellant argues that the RPD should not have made this finding. He argues that the RPD overlooked the fact that he was unemployed and in hiding during the 27-month period that he lived undisturbed by his agents of harm in Amman, as well as several items of evidence in the record and in the new evidence indicating that his agents of harm probably are affiliated with Daesh. He also argues that it was speculative for the RPD to infer that his agents of harm would no longer be interested in harming him because of the passage of time and because they did not harm his brother in XXXX when they asked his brother after his whereabouts.\n[15] While the RAD acknowledges that the RPD did not consider that the appellant was in hiding while he was living in Amman and the evidence that indicates that his agents of harm probably are Daesh supporters, the RAD finds that the appellant's argument still fails to persuade it that the RPD came to an incorrect first prong finding. The appellant's argument has pointed to nothing in the central allegations in his claim nor in the country documentary evidence indicating that his agents of harm and\/or Daesh are actually active in Amman itself, and, having reviewed the record and the new evidence that it has admitted, the RAD cannot discern anything in that regard either. The RAD notes that, unlike XXXX, Amman is the capital of the kingdom and, in conducting an independent assessment, the RAD is not prepared to speculate that the appellant's agents of harm and\/or Daesh must be seriously active in Amman just because the evidence indicates that they are active in a distant border town in the north such as XXXX. Moreover, the RAD notes that both the central allegations in his claim and the country documentary evidence relied upon by the appellant9 indicate that the Jordanian authorities take an active interest and make serious efforts to stamp out Daesh whenever they encounter Daesh in Jordan, and the appellant has never experienced a failure of state protection while he was living in Amman. The RAD is therefore not persuaded that the appellant has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection as it applies to him living in Amman. While the RAD again acknowledges that the appellant was in hiding while he lived in Amman in the 27-month period in the past (XXXX 2017-XXXX 2019), the RAD is not persuaded, for the reasons just stated previously, that he needed to be hiding from his agents of harm while he was there. In its independent assessment, the RAD therefore finds that the appellant does not have well-founded fear of persecution by his agents of harm in Amman, and that he does not face, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture from his agents of harm in Amman either.\nIFA Second Prong\n[16] The RPD found that it is objectively reasonable to expect the appellant to seek refuge in Amman for the following reasons:10\n[14] Having considered the conditions in Amman, and all the evidence before it, including the evidence concerning the claimant's long and successful career as a XXXX and an independent businessperson, as well as his successful relocation to Amman in XXXX 2017 which continued for more than 2 years, the panel finds that it is not objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge in Amman Jordan for the following reasons.\n[15] The courts have set a very high threshold for what makes an IFA unreasonable in all the circumstances. While claimants are not required to endure extraordinary risk in a proposed location, in the panel's view, the law is clear that a proposed locale does not become unreasonable for refugee claimants if they, for example, indicate, as the claimants has in this case, that they may not be able to find suitable work there. The claimant testified that due to the specialized nature of his XXXX work, he would be unlikely to secure a position or work to support him and his family in Amman. However, the claimant did acknowledge in his oral evidence that if Amman were safe for him, he could live there.\n[16] In considering the second prong, the panel notes that the claimant successfully relocated to Amman Jordan and lived there for more than 2 years before coming to Canada.\n[17] The panel finds that, based upon the claimant's substantial experience as an XXXX XXXX; as well as his skill and practice in running his own business, and his demonstrated track record of living and surviving in Amman, the claimant would likely be able to secure employment or establish a viable business in this proposed IFA city. The claimant is an experienced XXXX and business operator; he is healthy, and he is part of the Muslim majority in Jordan and speaks Arabic. The panel has no evidence before it to indicate any legal or practical impediment to the claimant relocating and establishing himself in Amman, particularly in that he has already done so between XXXX 2017 and XXXX 2019. Based on the evidence before it, the panel find that it is reasonable in all the circumstances for the claimant to safely relocate to Amman.\n[17] The appellant argues that the RPD should not have made this finding. He argues that the RPD ignored his testimony about his ability to reasonably re-establish himself in Amman. He argues \"that this is [not] a reasonable way to live - surviving, living in fear, unemployed, going out seldomly, [and] making six unsuccessful attempts to apply for visas.\"11\n[18] The RAD rejects this argument because it is contradicted and foreclosed by the appellant's own clear admission in testimony during the hearing, as the RPD noted above, that he can live in Amman if it is safe, as the RAD has found that Amman is based on the RAD's independent first prong analysis. The RAD therefore finds that it is objectively reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate to Amman in the RAD's independent assessment of the IFA second prong issue.\nRAD's IFA Conclusion\n[19] Therefore, as the RAD has independently assessed the first and second prongs of the IFA test in favour of viability, the RAD finds that Amman is a viable IFA for the appellant.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] Having reviewed and independently assessed the evidence, the RAD concludes that the RPD correctly determined that the appellant has a viable IFA in Amman.\n[21] The RAD therefore finds that the appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground and, on a balance of probabilities, would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returns to Jordan.\n[22] Pursuant to subsection 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD therefore confirms the RPD Decision and finds that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. His appeal is therefore dismissed.\n(signed)\nJOEL BOUSFIELD\nJoel Bousfield\nJanuary 24, 2023\nDate\n1 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, subsection 111(1)(a).\n3 Appellant's Record, Letter, at pp. 38-39.\n4 Ibid., Jerusalem Post article, at pp. 40-42.\n5 Ibid., Arab48.com article, at pp. 43-44.\n6 Ibid., Google map, at p. 48.\n7 Ibid., Weblinks to other items, pp. 46-47, and 49-54.\n8 RPD Record, RPD Decision, at pp. 6-7, paras. 11-13.\n9 RPD Record, Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Jordan (April 29, 2022), item 7.2: Jordan.

The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[5] According to their Basis of Claim (BOC)1 forms, the Appellants were both born in Viet Nam in 1996. The Principal Appellant lived in Nghe An and began practising Hoa Hao Buddhism in early 2018 when her friend XXXX introduced her to the religion because she was sad and disappointed about former boyfriends.\n[6] The Principal Appellant joined XXXX's Hoa Hao Buddhist group on XXXX XXXX, 2018. She usually practised at home and met with the group twice a month at the house of a fellow practitioner. The Principal Appellant's group were independent Hoa Hao Buddhists and did not register with the Viet Namese Communist Party.\n[7] In XXXX 2018 the Principal Appellant's group was invited to gather and interact with other Hoa Hao Buddhists at an ancestral Buddhist Temple in Phu My. On the morning of XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Principal Appellant's group and many Hoa Hao Buddhists were prevented by the police from going to the ancestral home for the ceremony. The Principal Appellant's group immediately returned to Nghe An.\n[8] Scared by the events of that day, the Principal Appellant, not wanting to give up her faith and spiritual life and living in constant fear of harassment, persecution and even imprisonment, decided to leave Viet Nam. With the help of an immigration agent, the Principal Appellant went to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX in XXXX 2019 where she met with lawyers to apply for immigration who said they could not help her.\n[9] The Principal Appellant arrived in Canada on a tourist visa on XXXX XXXX, 2019. She met up with the Associate Appellant who was a high school friend who had come to Canada on a student visa on XXXX XXXX, 2018. They fell in love and their child was born on XXXX XXXX, 2020. They have been common-law spouses since late XXXX 2020.\n[10] Unaware of her ability to make a refugee claim until March 2021, the Principal Appellant stayed in Canada after her visa expired and both Appellants claimed protection in April 2021.\nSCOPE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD) REVIEW\n[11] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in assessing and weighing the oral testimony heard, which in particular cases attracts deference.2 Unless specifically stated below, I have applied the correctness standard.\nANALYSIS\n[12] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant established her profile as a Hoa Hao Buddhist and identified the determinative issue as the well-foundedness of her fear of persecution. The RPD found that the objective evidence does not support the Principal Appellant's fear of persecution because (1) Viet Nam permits religious observance within a state-recognized framework; and (2) the Principal Appellant's practice of Hoa Hao Buddhism does not place her at risk of persecution. The RPD found that Associate Appellant does not have a credible subjective fear of persecution in Viet Nam.\n[13] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in finding that the Principal Appellant could practise her faith safely at home in Viet Nam and does not engage in the type of religious activity that would draw attention from the authorities. The Appellants argues that the RPD engaged in microscopic analysis of country evidence to support unfounded conclusions and failed to assess whether the limitation on the Principal Appellant's freedom of religion amounted to persecution, or cruel and unusual treatment. The Appellants also submit that the RPD erred in finding that Associate Appellant did not establish subjective fear, failed to engage in a forward-looking analysis of the risk and disregarded evidence supporting his fear.\n[14] The Appellants submit that the Viet Namese Communist Party's restrictions on Hoa Hao Buddhists like the Principal Appellant are persecutory and she cannot be expected to practise her faith either in secret or conform to unreasonable limitations on her faith in order for her and her family, including the Associate Appellant, to avoid persecution or other cruel mistreatment.\n[15] I have reviewed the evidence on the record, including the transcript of the September 6, 2022, hearing and the Appellants' arguments. For the reasons outlined below, I find that the RPD did not err in finding that the objective evidence does not support a well-found fear of persecution and the Principal Appellant's practice of Hoa Hao Buddhism in Viet Nam does not put the Appellants at risk of persecution in Viet Nam.\nViet Nam permits religious observance within a state-recognized framework\n[16] Citing objective evidence, the RPD found that Viet Nam permits religious observance within a state-recognized framework. According to the official census, there are approximately 13 million religious Viet Namese, constituting 14 percent of the population.3\n[17] Viet Nam controls how religions practise and operate through the Law on Belief and Religion.4 The law provides a two-step process for religions to first register their operations and, after five years, receive official recognition to practise their faith. Unregistered and unrecognized religions and religious groups can still practise by applying for a different set of permissions for specific religious activities. The ability to practise religion is not unlimited. The Law on Belief and Religion restricts those religious activities and practices that, put generally, undermine the national interest or public safety, and granting authorizations can vary by location.5 Surveillance and monitoring of religious activities is common, as are incidents of harassment and interference by state authorities, mostly at local levels.6\n[18] There are reports of persecution, abuse, and mistreatment of religious officials, followers, and institutions in Viet Nam, as well as challenges in obtaining government approvals7 which occur when authorities find religious followers are using their religious platforms to become politically active.8 A religious group's perceived politics is a key factor in approving registration applications.9\nVietnam's current approach is to allow space for religious worship but retain control through registration and oversight. Organisations and individuals that adhere to this, register and steer clear of politics are allowed to operate relatively unhindered whilst unregistered groups and individuals that become involved in politics, local activism and\/or support local grievances are monitored and may be suppressed.10\n[19] According to Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), \"[A]dherents of officially recognised religious groups are generally able to practise their faith with minimal interference from national authorities, but the situation differs from place to place.\"11 Many instances of alleged government interference with religious practice \"relate to religious groups that are politically active in local land or environmental disputes. It can be difficult to distinguish between religious and political claims.\"12 Allegations of government interference are most frequently directed at local or provincial officials.13 There is also evidence unregistered religious groups operate relatively free from official scrutiny and harassment. Members of unregistered groups can encounter opposition and are targeted by officials, but this varies \"depending on region, ethnicity, and any perceived or actual involvement in religious freedom advocacy or political activism.\"14\n[20] The US Department of State reports an improvement in treatment of unregistered groups, noting there are \"better relations between unregistered religious groups and local authorities and a reduction in aggressive forms of harassment.\"15\nPrincipal Appellant's practice of Hoa Hao Buddhism does not place the Appellants at risk of persecution\n[21] Based on the objective evidence, the RPD concluded that the Principal Appellant's practice of Hoa Hao Buddhism does not place her at risk of persecution and she can practise her Hoa Hao Buddhist faith freely if she does not participate in political advocacy as part of that faith.\n[22] Referencing a 2001 Response to Information Request (RIR)16 presented by the Appellants, the RPD acknowledged that the relationship between Hoa Hao Buddhism and the Viet Namese government \"is historically one of tension, suspicion, and acrimony creating an overlap between the religious and the political\"17 attributable to the fact that Hoa Hao Buddhists sided against the Viet Namese Community Party. The RPD recognized that the Principal Appellant's fear of persecution as a Hoa Hao Buddhist cannot be analyzed without acknowledging the existence of a political undercurrent.\n[23] Hoa Hao Buddhists in Viet Nam continue to be targeted by the state for activities deemed to pose a threat to political interests. A 2022 RIR describes unregistered groups of Hoa Hao Buddhists being harassed and mistreated18 and attempts by Hoa Hao followers to gather as a group is a major catalyst of arrests.19\n[24] The UK Home Office reports:\n[W]hen a gathering reaches numbers above 20-25 people the police get nervous about such a big group. The police then bring people into the police station to get details such as their names and relationships. They may be there for 3-4 hours and then released with some being issued a 'letter of invitation' to return for further questioning later. The citizen has the right to refuse but is likely to face harassment.20\nA Hoa Hao leader, interviewed for the same UK Home Office report, summarizes the potential for mistreatment as follows:\n[W]e continue facing harassment economically and politically. They may refuse granting us with papers or restrict our movements. For example, whenever I go out there are usually four people following me. I noticed that there is a change in the way they follow. In the past the people following me tried to prevent me from doing something that was viewed as illegal. Now the police just want to find an excuse or justification to arrest us.21\n[25] The RPD found that this evidence does not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution because it demonstrates that, while the potential for mistreatment is real, there are still millions of Hoa Hao Buddhists in Viet Nam who follow their faith and act in accordance with its beliefs.22\n[26] In her BOC narrative, the Principal Appellant described her practice in Viet Nam as praying at home and participating in a group meeting twice a month with several other Hoa Hao Buddhists, including her friend XXXX who introduced her to the religion.23 She testified that there were eight in their group and they gathered two times per month to pray together then prepare and eat food.24 The Principal Appellant also testified that the group did not gather again after the XXXX 2018 incident,25 and she continued her own personal prayer at home and Hoa Hao observance.26\n[27] In Canada, the Principal Appellant testified that she continues praying daily and reads the Sam Giang, the Hoa Hao holy book, approximately once per week.27 She does not participate in Hoa Hao gatherings in Toronto28 and does not know Hoa Hao Buddhists in Canada.29 She does not try to encourage others to become Hoa Hao Buddhists.30 She testified religion is personal and it should be an individual's decision to become religious, and she has not encouraged her husband to become a Hoa Hao Buddhist.31\n[28] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant does not have the profile of an active, unregistered Hoa Hao practitioner who engages in the type of religious activity and gathering that could, on a balance of probabilities, attract the attention of Viet Namese authorities and lead to interference with her religious beliefs and practice and constitute persecution.\n[29] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant's attendance at the XXXX 2018 gathering does not change this finding. The Principal Appellant testified, \"[T]here was one friend who recommended me to join the event over there, so when I went there ...\"32 and \"I had just joined to this group, so Ms. XXXX asked me to join with her.\"33 The RPD concluded that the Principal Appellant's testimony indicates, on a balance of probabilities, she attended the XXXX 2018 event because she was influenced by her friend XXXX who introduced her to the religion and not because of her religious conviction. She could not testify in detail about what the gathering was, only saying there was a feast without knowing why.34 When the RPD asked the Principal Appellant why she did not know what the purpose of the gathering was, she replied, \"At that time, I had just joined to the group, so I did not ask too much. So Ms. XXXX asked me and then I just joined with her.\"35\n[30] When the RPD asked the Principal Appellant if her group had any problems with the government or police, she gave the following testimony:36\nRPD\nPrincipal Appellant\nDid your group [of] eight people ever have problems with anyone in the Vietnamese government or police?\nNo. Because[...] no, we do not have any problem with the Vietnamese government. We do not register to the government for this religion.\nRight. Do you know there were problems when you went to Phu My?\nI actually did not know why but when I went there, I saw there were many police officers. They were standing there to suppress the crowd.\nWhat did you think [...] what was your reaction to seeing what happened in Phu My?\nAt that time, I was very, very nervous. So I was asking everyone in our group to go back home [...] to run away from that suppression.\nDid [...] did any of the police in Phu My know that you were there as a Hoa Hao Buddhist?\nNo.\nAnd so what did you do when you got back home?\nWhen I went back home, I just was inside home.\nWhat happened to your group of eight?\nWe all went back home but after that day, we did not gather together because we were scared.\n[31] The RPD concluded that the Principal Appellant's attendance at the XXXX 2018 gathering does not establish she has the profile of a Hoa Hao Buddhist follower who engages in the type of religious activity that could give rise to a serious possibility of persecution, and her testimony indicates she was not at risk following this incident.\n[32] When the RPD asked the Principal Appellant if she had ever had any problems practising either by herself at home or with her group in her hometown, she answered, \"Yeah, there is no issue.\"37\n[33] The RPD concluded that the evidence indicates on a balance of probabilities that the Principal Appellant can return to Viet Nam and resume her daily practice of Hoa Hao Buddhism without a serious possibility of persecution. The evidence also indicates that on a balance of probabilities she can continue gathering with others in Nghe An as she did not testify why this would not be the case.\n[34] While the RPD acknowledged the Appellants' counsel's post-hearing submissions,38 which provided an overview of mistreatment of Hoa Hao followers in Viet Nam, the RPD found that they did not grapple with the duality of religious adherence in Viet Nam and the fact that many religious adherents can practise their faith. The RPD found that the Appellants' counsel's submissions did not explain how and why the Principal Appellant, with the profile she established, falls in the category of a Hoa Hao practitioner who faces a serious possibility of persecution. The RPD found that the specificity of religious practice in Viet Nam and divisions within Hoa Hao practice and the corresponding treatment by authorities indicates that not all non-registered Hoa Hao followers will be treated in the same way.\n[35] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, she is a Hoa Hao Buddhist who engages in the type of religious activities she unknowingly found herself attending in XXXX 2018 and which could place one in the category of Hoa Hao follower to attract the attention of Viet Namese authorities.\n[36] The Appellants submit that \"[t]he RPD seriously errs in making the determinative finding that the Appellant could practice her faith freely, as long as she practiced privately at home,\"39 referencing paragraphs 12 and 34-37 of the RPD decision. Following my own review of those paragraphs and the RPD decision as a whole, I find that the Appellants erred and that the RPD did not make any such finding. Instead, the RPD finding was as detailed above in paragraph 33, that the Principal Appellant could resume her daily practice of Hoa Hao Buddhism and continue gathering with others in Nghe An.\n[37] The Appellants also submit that the RPD decision \"implies that the Appellant must simply accept that she cannot meet with other Hoa Hao Buddhists, and that she must continue to practice at home, secretly, without ever sharing her faith publicly for the rest of her life.\"40 Once again, the Appellants err because the RPD decision does make any such implication or statement.\n[38] The Appellants also submit \"that in making the determinative finding that the Appellant could practice her faith safely at home in Vietnam, the RPD member disregarded probative evidence and fundamentally misapprehended the totality of the evidence.\"41\n[39] I disagree and find, as detailed above, that the RPD provided a balanced assessment of the objective evidence about Hoa Hao Buddhists and correctly concluded that not all unregistered Hoa Hao Buddhists are treated in the same manner.\n[40] The constitution of Viet Nam states that all people have freedom of belief and religion but that the law provides for government control of religious practices.42 Hoa Hao Buddhism is one of 38 government-recognized religions stemming from 16 religious traditions.43 There are estimates that there may be up to 8 million followers in Viet Nam, although a more realistic estimate is around 2 million.44\n[41] The Appellants assert that \"[u]nregistered Hoa Hao Buddhists do not need to be politically active or actively anti-government to be persecuted,\"45 citing their political history.46 I find that the RPD acknowledged that Hoa Hao Buddhists face higher scrutiny than some other religions due to their historical political opposition to communism.47 I note also that the DFAT report cited by the Appellants goes on to contradict their assertion, stating:48\n3.43 Hoa Hao is a Vietnamese school of Buddhism formed in 1939. It has had some political history, first opposing French colonialism then backing Ho Chi Minh's nationalism and later supporting US-backed South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem. Hoa Hao Buddhists mostly live in the Mekong Delta.\n3.44 As with other religions in Vietnam, a distinction should be made between registered and unregistered congregations, and those that engage in political activity and those that do not. According to diplomatic sources quoted by the UK Home Office in a February 2020 report, the number of unregistered adherents is probably small and they live in remote areas with few economic opportunities. Several followers were sentenced in 2018 to between six and 12 years in prison for using loudspeakers to protest against Government treatment of the group and for spreading anti-Government messages on social media. Media reports describe alleged police beatings at unregistered Hoa Hao protests in 2019 and 2020.\n3.45 DFAT assesses that adherents of registered Hoa Hao groups face a low risk of official discrimination. Unregistered Hoa Hao adherents face a moderate risk of official discrimination. Those who engage in anti-Government activities face a higher risk. Hoa Hao adherents may have low levels of education and political understanding which may expose them to further risk. [emphasis added]\n[42] The determinative issue is whether the Principal Appellant has the profile of a Hoa Hao Buddhist who engages in religious and political activities which would attract the attention of the Viet Namese police or authorities:\nIn general, a person, regardless of being a member of registered or unregistered group, who practices their faith without seeking to challenge or criticise the state are unlikely to be at risk of treatment that amounts to persecution or serious harm. Persons who, however, belong to unregistered groups and criticise or challenge the state may face state monitoring, harassment, arrest, interrogation and torture. Whether they are they are at risk of persecution or serious harm will depend on their profile and activities.49\n[43] Based on the evidence, I agree with the RPD that the Principal Appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, her profile as a Hoa Hao Buddhist who would attract the attention of the authorities in Viet Nam.\n[44] The Appellants argue that the Associate Appellant's fear of persecution is as a family member of the Principal Appellant.\n[45] For all these reasons, I agree with the RPD that the Appellants have not established on a balance of probabilities that their fear of persecution in Viet Nam is well founded.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Susan Brown\"\nSusan Brown\nJanuary 30, 2023\nDate\n1 RPD-1, RPD Record, pages 10-21, Exhibit 2.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They are all citizens of Nigeria.\n[2] They appeal a Decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated 12 September 2022 and ask that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) find them Convention1 refugees or persons in need of protection. Alternatively, they request that their file be returned to the RPD to be reconsidered by a differently constituted panel. The RPD found that the Appellants were credible with respect to their allegations however it found that they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection because they have an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Port Harcourt.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The Appellants are family members who travelled to Canada together with their daughter and sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Another adult son did not travel to Canada and lives in the United Kingdom.\n[5] Their claims were heard together, and XXXX was found to be a Convention refugee based on her membership in a particular social group as a person with disabilities. The RPD found she could not avail herself of state protection or an IFA.\n[6] The family's allegations are set out in detail in their Basis of Claim (BOC) narratives and addendums. In summary, the oldest child and only daughter XXXX was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX shortly after birth. She was later also diagnosed with a XXXX XXXX XXXX. The three younger children are physically and developmentally typical. XXXX and her family experienced a high degree of stigma, isolation and accusations that the parents were using their daughter to make money through rituals. They moved to different schools and different communities in an effort to get their daughter an education and to live safely and openly trying to minimize the stigma of having a child with disabilities.\n[7] In the midst of these struggles, in XXXX 2021 the family home was attacked by armed men, dressed like Fulani Herdsmen and speaking Hausa, Yoruba and Pidgin languages. The armed men threatened to kill the family, tied up the Associate Appellant and almost kidnapped one of the Minor Appellants. They took everything the Appellants had including their bank cards and one of their vehicles. They did not kill any of the family members but warned them that they would be back to rob them again.\n[8] Despite reporting this to the police the crime was never investigated, and the police did not appear to take it seriously. Just over two weeks later there were more gangs running through the town \"on rampage...and attacking all vehicles.\"2 The family fled on foot and moved to another area. They continued to get calls and threats and were told they could not hide from their assailants. The Appellants do not know who was behind the attacks and there is no evidence pointing to why they were targeted. These attacks traumatized the family and XXXX lost what little ability she had to communicate. The whole family went to the hospital for assessment of their trauma.3\n[9] The family indicate that they have moved in 2002, 2003, 2006, 2016 and 2021 and cited reasons of discrimination, threat to their lives based on religious intolerance, multiple instances of discrimination against them, threats to kidnap and threats to their lives. The family fled to Canada in late XXXX 2021.\nRPD Decision\n[10] The RPD found that the Appellants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), nor are they persons in need of protection pursuant to sub-section.97 (1)(b).4 The RPD went on to find that an IFA exists for these Appellants in Port Harcourt.\nAppellants Arguments on Appeal\n[11] Counsel for the Appellants (Counsel) argues that the RPD did not assess their claim on a forward-facing basis, cumulatively, or in accordance with section 96. She argues that the RPD did not consider the objective evidence it applied to XXXX to the Appellants as family members of a person with a disability.\n[12] Counsel argues that the Appellants face treatment amounting to persecution and are being accused of witchcraft as a result of the accusations of using XXXX for money.\n[13] Counsel argues that the RPD erred in its IFA analysis under the second prong. Counsel argues that the Associate Appellant's family want to bring harm to the family because of the \"curse\"5 of having XXXX. I will address this argument under the first prong of IFA.\n[14] Counsel argues that the RPD did not consider that the Appellants' experiences of discrimination and stress cumulatively amount to persecution.\nOther Issues\n[15] In Section II, paragraph 5, Counsel poses the following: \"It is respectfully submitted that the issues in this appeal are as follows...c.) Whether the Panel undertook a procedurally fair process at the hearing?\"6\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[16] The Appellants have submitted the following:\ni. an Affidavit from the Principal Appellant7;\nii. A family medical report from Nigeria dated XXXX XXXX 2022;\niii. 'Lynching in the Name of Witchcraft', a newspaper editorial dated 23 September 2022;\niv. a journal article about people in Nigeria with disabilities dated 19 August 2022;\nv. Nigeria: Children and Young People with Disabilities, October 2021;\nvi. National Document Package (NDP) for Nigeria Response to Information Report;\nvii. Nigeria: People With Mental Health Conditions Chained, Abused, 11 November 2019.\nTwo items of evidence presented by the Appellants accepted and no oral hearing\n[17] According to the Law,8 I can only accept evidence that:\ni. arose after the RPD decision; or\nii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii. that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[18] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.\n[19] With respect to item (a.), the Affidavit of the Principal Appellant.9 The Affidavit reiterates the contents of the Appellant's BOC form narrative, addendums, and her responses to the RPD's findings. The content of the affidavit does not constitute new evidence under section 110(4) of the IRPA and would have been better placed in the Appeal Memorandum, as required by the RAD Rules.10 Notwithstanding this procedural oversight, I have taken into consideration the content of the affidavit as submissions in considering the Appellant's position regarding the RPD Decision.\n[20] With respect to item (b.), the Medical Report from Nigeria11. This medical report addresses the mental health effects on the Appellants after the violent home invasion they experienced in XXXX 2021. While this letter predates the RPD Decision date of 12 September 2022, the Appellants explained during the Hearing that they had requested but not received the report prior to the RPD Hearing.12 The document is new, it is from a credible source and relevant to the issues in this appeal. As such I have admitted this item as new evidence.\n[21] With respect to item (c.), the newspaper article about lynching in response to witchcraft in Nigeria,13 the article postdates the RPD Decision. Further, the content is new, credible and relevant as it pertains to traditional beliefs of witchcraft in Nigeria and how people suspected of engaging in witchcraft are treated in Nigeria. I have admitted this item as new evidence.\n[22] Item f. is the NDP Item 1.27 from the NDP for Nigeria (30 June 2022) and as such it already forms part of the Record and I have not admitted it as new evidence.\n[23] Items (d.)14, (e.)15 and (g.)16 all post date the RPD Decision and Counsel has not provided a reason why these items could not have been adduced earlier. I have not admitted these items as new evidence.\nNo oral hearing\n[24] The Appellants have requested an oral hearing. Pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, the RAD may hold a hearing if there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection 110(3), which includes new evidence under subsection 110(4), and raises serious issues with respect to the credibility of the Appellants, is central to the Decision with respect to the refugee protection claim, and if accepted would justify allowing or rejecting the claim. Otherwise, the RAD must proceed without a hearing, relying on the RPD Record.\n[25] In this case, while I accept two items of new evidence, I find that they do not raise any serious credibility issues with respect to the Appellants. As such, the criteria for holding an oral hearing have not been met.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[26] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.17 I have reviewed the entire Record, including the audio recording of the RPD proceedings and the documents and submissions of the Appellants. I find the RPD enjoyed no meaningful advantage with respect to the assessment of this evidence.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[27] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.18 The RPD found that the Appellants were highly credible witnesses. I agree with the RPD for the same reasons, namely that the Appellants testified in a straightforward and detailed manner, free from embellishment. Their testimony was, on the whole, consistent with their BOC forms and there were no significant inconsistencies that were not reasonably explained. I find the Appellants are credible with respect to their allegations.\nRPD Hearing and Decision procedurally fair\n[28] In the Written Statement Counsel indicates that \"The Appellants are requesting a new hearing under subsection 110(6) of the Act given the procedural fairness issues here...\"19\n[29] In Section II, paragraph 5, Counsel poses the following: \"It is respectfully submitted that the issues in this appeal are as follows...c.) Whether the Panel undertook a procedurally fair process at the hearing?\"20\n[30] Counsel has not cited any elements of the RPD Hearing or Decision that indicate that the RPD was unfair in conducting the hearing or adjudicating the claim. Upon my own review I find that the RPD handled the Hearing sensitively, responding to the Appellants' heightened emotional state when testifying about difficult experiences. The RPD offered breaks, asked Counsel about proceeding, offered the adult Appellants to both participate in the Hearing as they were able. In my own review of the RPD's Decision I see no evidence of a breach of procedural fairness and find it was based fairly on the Record before them.\n[31] The courts have been clear that Members are entitled to draw conclusions based on the evidence and further that a negative credibility determination or a difficult outcome are not, on their own, evidence of a closed mind. In this case Counsel suggests that the RPD breached the Appellants' right to procedural fairness however I find the RPD's Decision was correct, and the claim was decided fairly.\nThe RPD correctly assessed the Appellant's risk\n[32] The two grounds of risk the Appellants alleged were first that they would be persecuted because they are family members of a person with a disability and second as people who have been accused of witchcraft. The RPD noted that the family fear kidnapping throughout Nigeria. According to the Appellants' Memorandum, the RPD erred in describing their fears as being related to kidnapping and violence in Nigeria.21\nRisk based on status as XXXX's family members\n[33] The Appellants have credibly established that they have faced stigma and discrimination as a result of being associated with a family member with physical and developmental disabilities. As did the RPD I accept their testimony that XXXX's siblings have experienced bullying and discrimination at school and that some people go as far as not wanting to touch them or be in close physical proximity for fear of being tainted by XXXX.\n[34] When asked about persecution as a result of being family members of a person with a disability the Principal Appellant testified \"In our neighbourhood they said we use our daughter to do rituals to have money, that is why we cannot throw her away.\"22 When asked if the family had faced any threats to their lives or safety as a result of their daughter's health the Associate Appellant testified that they had not received any threats rather they were told frequently not to care for their daughter.23\n[35] Their experiences are borne out by the objective evidence which indicates that people with mental or physical disabilities suffer from social stigma, exploitation, and discrimination.24 While Nigeria has signed and ratified both the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and its Optional Protocols, medical health care for person with disabilities is scarce and persons with mental or physical disabilities are often accused of witchcraft.25 Public attitudes towards people with disabilities vary but are most often negative and individuals with disabilities face rejection and are thought of being unworthy of being alive.26 The RPD pointed to the objective evidence that indicates many families have to live with some stigma and may be ridiculed or laughed at.27 The same source describes family members of persons with disabilities as being highly ostracized because of the possible perception that such a child is a bad omen.\n[36] In its Decision the RPD correctly outlined the following:\n\"to find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution based on their relationship to (XXXX), the panel must determine whether the mistreatment faced or anticipated is sufficiently serious to rise to the level of persecution by examining what interest of the claimants might be harmed and to what extent, the subsistence, enjoyment, expression or exercise of that interest or interests might be compromised. According to Canadian jurisprudence in particular, the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Ward28, in order to find one has been persecuted, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated to be suffered must be serious in that it constitutes a key denial of core human rights. Further cases have expanded on this concept, including that the mistreatment may be repetitive and persistent, but this is not always a necessary factor29 and that acts of discrimination or mistreatment ought not be considered in isolation but rather can be considered collectively and cumulatively rise beyond discrimination and amount to persecution.\"30\n[37] The RPD found that the Appellants did not establish that they face a serious possibility of persecution based on their relationship to XXXX.31\n[38] While I sympathize with the Appellants that they have experienced many difficulties and stress as a result of the attitudes and beliefs of others when it comes to having a family member with a disability in Nigeria and do not wish to return to Nigeria, I find that they have not credibly established that there is a serious possibility of persecution as result. The Appellants have not adduced any evidence of how their experience of discrimination as family members of a person with a disability amount to persecution. My own review of the objective evidence does not bear out Counsel's assertion that family members are treated the same way as people with disabilities, nor has the Appellants' own testimony. Upon return to Nigeria, it is reasonable to conclude that when people find out that they have a family member with a disability they will continue to face stigma and discrimination which will undoubtedly be stressful for the Appellants. However, these negative experiences, as distressing as they are, do not rise to the level of persecution set out in section 96 of the IRPA in the form of a serious violation of their fundamental rights, being personally or collectively targeted and that this is distinguished from discrimination. Under section 97 (a)(b) of the IRPA the Appellants have not credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that the stigma and discrimination they face by having a family member with a disability is life threatening, puts them personally at risk, is not faced generally by others in their situation.\n[39] Therefore, I find that the RPD did not err in analyzing the evidence about the impact on the family members of having a person with a disability in their family unit.\nRisk of persecution based on allegations of witchcraft\n[40] Counsel argues that the RPD misapprehended the evidence and that the Appellants testified that the family and community believe that the family is cursed, and that XXXX is the omen of the curse. Counsel argues that the Appellants face treatment amounting to persecution and are being accused of witchcraft as a result of allegedly using XXXX for money. They further argue that \"Accusations of witchcraft does rise to the level of persecution and, accordingly, the determination here should be overturned.\"32\n[41] The Principal Appellant stated in her BOC forms that \"(people) accused us of having used (XXXX) for money rituals that is why we care for her; that she is a source of our wealth, which is why we can't through (sic) her away. It's a very painful insinuation.\"33 The Associate Appellant reported that \"(the family) endured open discrimination that the child is a bad omen and does not deserve attention.\"34 And further \"We were accused of using our child for ritual purposes and that we lived a comfortable life because of the ritual rites.\"35\n[42] During the Hearing the Associate Appellant testified, with reference to having a child with a disability \"back in our hometown it was taboo, it was any misfortunes that comes to some families as they would that that it is because of the child that with disability.\"36\n[43] The objective evidence indicates that \"'witch branding' takes place when a woman is blamed for a negative incident that occurred in the community and labelled a witch.\"37 And that women so branded may have to carry out traditional rites such as giving the community gifts like gold. Further \"that women, especially older widowed women, may, in some ethnic groups, particularly in rural areas, be accused of being witches where unexplained deaths occur, (for example, in context of HIV and AIDS), unprecedented natural disasters happen, or harvests inexplicably fail. Expulsion from the village and the community; exclusion or forced seclusion; in extreme cases death by stoning might be carried out.\"38 Another source indicates that elderly women in certain parts of Nigeria can be accused of witchcraft and may experience violence against them39 which is also outlined in the article submitted into new evidence.40\n[44] The RPD noted that the Appellants described being embarrassed, stared at in public, called names, and accused of using XXXX for money rituals. They also credibly testified that XXXX is considered a bad omen and blamed for any misfortune that befalls the extended family. However, despite these experiences, the Appellants did not describe any threat made to them or any risk to their life or safety as a result of XXXX's disability.41 In my own independent analysis I agree with these findings for the same reasons.\n[45] While the Appellants have no doubt experienced stigma and accusations of using their daughter to make money, they have not credibly established that they are perceived as witches and that they face a serious possibility of persecution on this basis upon return to Nigeria. The Appellants did not indicate in their BOC or in their oral testimony that they have been labelled as witches, nor did they indicate that any agents of harm or persecution seek them out because of a belief that they practise witchcraft.\n[46] Therefore, I find that the RPD did not err in assessing the Appellants' profiles and the risk to them on the basis of their identity as those accused of witchcraft. Nor did they undertake an over vigilant or microscopic analysis of the evidence before them.\nThe Appellants do not meet the test for cumulative discrimination rising to the level of persecution\n[47] Counsel argues that the RPD failed to assess whether this is a situation of cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution. While I agree that the RPD did not explicitly address the test for cumulative discrimination, I do not find this test has been met. Therefore, this argument does not establish that the RPD erred.\n[48] In a previous case adjudicated by my colleague, she set out a framework to assess cumulative discrimination as follows:\ni. What allegations are credible?\nii. Are the credible allegations discriminatory or persecutory?\niii. What is the environment in the country and the contextual circumstances and has the claimant or appellant demonstrated a connection between the objective documents and their situation?\niv. What are the refugee claimants' personal circumstances and vulnerabilities, and how will this impact on their risk of discrimination or persecution?\nv. On the basis of these factors, do the refugee claimants face systemic or persistent harm which lead them to facing an insecure future existence?42\n[49] The RPD found the Appellants credible. Their allegations as set out in their BOCs, amended BOCs and their testimony (reviewed above) was that the Appellants would face embarrassment, being stared at in public, called names, and accused of using XXXX for money rituals. None of these allegations point to acts that are persecutory in nature although they are clearly discriminatory. The Appellants have also credibly described the stress and mental health challenges some of the family members have experienced as a result of the stigma as well as the home invasion.\n[50] The Appellants established that when seen in public with XXXX they faced these discriminatory acts, and the treatment is connected to the country conditions. Regarding the Appellants' personal circumstances and vulnerabilities, both of the adult Appellants have XXXX XXXX degrees, and the Associate Appellant has a long history of XXXX XXXX work experience throughout his adult life. The Appellants started their own XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX when they could not find proper care for their daughter. While some family members who live in a village continue to stigmatize them, they have other supportive family throughout Nigeria. Finally, many of the issues the family have faced have been while being in public with XXXX and she has now been granted Convention refugee status in Canada.\n[51] When I look at all of this evidence together, I find that the Appellants have not established that they would face systemic or persistent harm which would lead them to facing an insecure future existence. Undoubtedly returning to Nigeria and re-establishing themselves will be difficult for the Appellants. However, this does not establish that the Appellants face a risk of discrimination amounting to persecution. I find that this is not established on the Record.\nRPD did not err in their IFA analysis\n[52] For the reasons set out below I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants have not established their agent of persecution possesses the means or motivation to locate them in Port Harcourt, such that they face a serious possibility of persecution, or a subsection 97(1) of the IRPA risk, in the IFA location. In consideration of the Appellants' particular circumstances, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, it is reasonable for the Appellants to seek refuge in Port Harcourt.\n[53] The RPD correctly set out the test for determining whether a viable IFA exists and found that the Appellants had a viable IFA in Port Harcourt.\n[54] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal's Decision in Rasaratnam.43\nFirst Prong of the Test\n[55] I must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the Appellants being persecuted in the part of the country in which I find an IFA exists and\/or the Appellants would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\nSecond Prong of the Test\n[56] Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, for them to seek refuge there.\n[57] Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have an IFA. Once the issue of an IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellants to show that they do not have an IFA. The finding of an IFA must be based on a distinct evaluation of the region for that purpose taking into account the Appellants' personal circumstances.\n[58] The Court of Appeal has held that \"[t]here will always be hardship with relocation, but the threshold for unreasonable is very high and requires conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\"44 It is also recognized that the burden is not on the RAD to establish that the IFA is safe but rather on the Appellant to demonstrate that it is not reasonable.45\nFirst Prong of IFA - No Serious Possibility of Persecution\n[59] The RPD analyzed the IFA as it related to the Appellants' fear of criminals, kidnapping and crime in Nigeria, which was unrelated to their relationship with XXXX and entirely of a criminal nature. It found that there was no evidence to support a finding on the agents of harm's capability to track and locate individuals across Nigeria because there was a lack of evidence to establish who the agents of harm are. The RPD found that the Appellants had not discharged their burden regarding the first prong of the IFA test and determined that the first prong of the test had been met.46\n[60] Counsel argues that the RPD erred in finding that Port Harcourt met the first prong test because the RPD did not analyse the Appellants' risk, not from criminals, but from the Principal Appellant's family who want to bring harm to the family because of the \"curse\"47 of having XXXX. Counsel argues that those relatives live near Port Harcourt and are motivated to harm the Appellants.\n[61] Specifically, Counsel argues that they provided evidence of \"(t)he lack of meaningful participation in society is also seen in (the Associate Appellant's) oral testimony that: Our extended family feel it is a curse of our daughter and the children and parents believe they will be cursed with close contact. They have no close contact with us.48 In oral testimony (the Associate Appellant) also stated: We tried to defy what the community\/cultural attitude felt about our family but people would push her (XXXX] out of the photos. We were restricted our socialization with people, family, neighbours and friends. People did not want to associate with someone with a disability.\"49 Counsel argues that the Appellants will not be able to participate meaningfully in Port Harcourt society as a result.\n[62] The Appellants argue that members of the Associate Appellant's family suggest the Appellants send XXXX to the forest to die and that his mother told them not to return to the village. However, the Appellants have adduced no credible evidence that they will be sought out by people from the village should they resettle in Port Harcourt and not return to the village. There is no evidence on the Record that family members have sought the Appellants out in Port Harcourt or elsewhere, only that they are not welcome in the village and that some family members may want to harm XXXX if she were to visit the village.\n[63] While I certainly sympathize with the Appellants and they have credibly testified to a history of stressful and difficult experiences with their family members and other members of society as a result of having a family member with a disability, they have not credibly established that this maltreatment rises to the level of risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or danger as set out in the test for IFA.\nSecond Prong of IFA - Port Harcourt is a Reasonable IFA for the Appellants in Their Particular Circumstances\n[64] In their Reasons the RPD dealt with issues of travel to, employment and housing in the IFA and found that the Appellants could reasonably resettle in any of the identified IFA cities.\n[65] In a review of their BOC forms and oral testimony, the Appellants indicate that the Principal Appellant and the Minor Appellants were born in Port Harcourt. The Appellants report that they lived in Port Harcourt for several years and moved from Port Harcourt in 2006 because they found a school in Lagos that would accept XXXX. The Appellants also report that they left Port Harcourt in 2006 due to \"(d)iscrimination and threat of kidnap.\"50 The Associate Appellant testified that \"if we go back especially close to Port Harcourt where it is not far from the village whereby, we came from there is the likelihood that we will still receive the same persecution.\"51\n[66] In my own independent analysis, I find that while it is undoubtedly difficult for the Appellants to be rejected by family members because XXXX has a disability, this difficulty does not, on a balance of probabilities, jeopardize the life and safety of the Appellants.\nMental health Hardship in the IFA\nConsiderations before the Immigration and Refugee Board\n[67] The RPD also noted that risk arising out of inadequate health or medical care does not fall within the scope of section 96 or section 97 (1)(a) or (b) of the IRPA, and therefore, also falls outside of the RPD's consideration.\n[68] Counsel argues that the RPD erred in citing the scope of the RPD's considerations. Counsel argues that \"the mental health status and quality of mental health care services in any proposed IFA goes to 'in all circumstances of the case' which MUST be considered when assessing the hardship associate with the IFA. Accordingly the Panel is incorrect with respect to the finding that such factors are outside of the panel's consideration. It is exactly such considerations that make an IFA reasonable or unreasonable.\"52\n[69] In my own analysis I agree with Counsel that the RPD erred in stating that inadequate medical care does not fall under the scope of section 96 of the IRPA. Inadequate medical care could be relevant under section 96 of the IRPA if it is being withheld because of an Appellant's nexus to a Convention ground (i.e., the state refuses to provide treatment to persons of a particular religion or particular social group). Moreover, inadequate medical care could be relevant under section 96 of the IRPA in determining if an IFA is reasonable under the second prong.\nPort Harcourt Reasonable\n[70] In its Decision the RPD correctly acknowledged not only the Appellants' testimony about their mental health needs but also the objective evidence that stigma associated with mental health issues is a problem in Nigeria, as well as the sometimes-inhumane treatment of those experiencing more overt symptoms and the fact that mental health services are limited in Nigeria.53\n[71] The RPD went on to find that there is a lack of evidence to establish that the Appellants have been diagnosed with a mental health condition, the RPD was \"left to speculate as to any as to any risk\/visibility in Nigeria and the availability of treatment and similarly would need to speculate regarding any finding of risk of persecution or hardship.\"54 While the Appellants stated that returning to Nigeria would be traumatizing and would exacerbate Minor Appellant 2's XXXX there is no evidence, through either testimony or objective evidence, provided by the Appellants that is sufficient to find the IFA unreasonable. Further the RPD found that there was no evidence that the Appellants have been targeted because of their mental health concerns and there is a lack of evidence regarding having a mental condition at all, let alone a severe mental illness. The RPD again correctly acknowledged the objective evidence that mental health services are lacking in Nigeria and mental health is stigmatized it also noted that counseling is available to victims of violence and community, family structures and religious institutions may, in some cases, cover the gaps. The RPD found that the Appellants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities that their current or future mental health would render the IFA unduly harsh.55\n[72] Counsel argues that the Principal Appellant had difficulties regulating her emotions throughout the Hearing, which is evidenced on the Record. Counsel asserts that the Primary Appellant \"displayed significant mental health difficulties during the proceeding itself\" and that both the Primary and Associate Appellants \"confirmed significant mental health symptoms in their oral evidence.\"56 Counsel goes on to argue that the stigma associated with seeking mental health support is so great that the Appellants cannot access it without repercussion to the Associate Appellants employment and that this amounts to a violation of their human rights. Counsel argues that the Appellants' own testimony is evidence that both have significant mental health symptoms.\n[73] Counsel argues that the RPD erred in finding that the Appellants have no documented mental health diagnoses and points to the evidence submitted to the RAD which states \"We had the entire members of the family for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX)l. The most affected have been (the Associate Appellant, the Principal Appellant and Minor Appellant 2.\"57 Counsel argues that it is because of the stigma that the Principal and Associate Appellants testified that they do not have current mental health issues.\n[74] While I agree with Counsel that the Primary Appellant was emotionally distraught during the RPD Hearing, this is not evidence of a diagnosed mental illness. There was no evidence before the RPD and limited evidence before the RAD of any of the Appellants' diagnosis and no evidence of what their current mental health status and treatment needs are. The medical note from a XXXX in Nigeria admitted here as item (b.) is dated XXXX XXXX 2022. It refers to five members of the family, including the four Appellants. The note outlines the events of XXXX XXXX 2021 when the family experienced the armed home invasion. After which the clinician states that all members were assessed for XXXX and as noted above, the adult Appellants and Minor Appellant 2 were most affected. The clinician ends the note with \"They currently present with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This medical report is thus for both medical and other authorities to please note and render all necessary support.\"58\n[75] The letter does not appear to be a complete psychological or psychiatric assessment. There is no mention of the date the Appellants met with the clinician or what tests were conducted upon which to make a diagnosis of XXXX. It contains general statements about all of the Appellants, though less so about Minor Appellant 1. There is no recommended treatment plan or follow up.\n[76] The Appellants have not adduced credible evidence of any further follow up or treatment for the Associate and Minor Appellants. The Principal Appellant testified that she saw a XXXX in Nigeria who put her on medication for her XXXX.59\n[77] During the RPD Hearing the Appellants were asked whether they currently had any mental health conditions. Both of the adult Appellants confirmed that neither of them was diagnosed and that Minor Appellant 2 had seen a doctor who referred him to a XXXX for an assessment. The Principal Appellant testified that Minor Appellant 2 was seeing a XXXX XXXX for support from XXXX 2021 through XXXX 2022. He was scheduled to continue in XXXX, but the sessions had to be postponed because the XXXX XXXX had XXXX.60 The Appellants have provided no update on Minor Appellant 2's resumption of XXXX or follow up with a XXXX.\n[78] I agree with the RPD that the Appellants have adduced no credible evidence that they have been targeted as a result of their mental health concerns and that there is a lack of evidence regarding any mental illness for which any of them have been diagnosed.\n[79] In my own analysis, I find that the Appellants have not met the burden of establishing that they could not relocate to Port Harcourt. Having considered the conditions of Port Harcourt and all of the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, I find that they have not established a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in Port Harcourt. I further find that it is not objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to seek refuge in Port Harcourt.\nConsiderations outside my jurisdiction\n[80] From the Appellants' testimony and written submissions, it is evident they want to protect their family from what they believe are physically, mentally and emotionally unsafe and insecure situations in Nigeria and provide for the continued care of XXXX. Although I have not found they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, I have compassion for the Appellants.\nCONCLUSION\n[81] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the Decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nS.

Escoffery\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I dismiss this appeal. The Appellant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Mr. V) is a citizen of Nicaragua.\n1. Mr. V alleges fear of persecution in Nicaragua for his same sex profile; while in the USA he was accused of the theft of antique garment buttons from his employer.\n2. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found Mr. V excluded from refugee protection because it found serious reasons for considering that he committed the serious crime of theft over $5000; Mr. V maintains that he was not aware the goods he sold on eBay were stolen and blames another employee named XXXX.\n3. The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is whether the presumption of seriousness of theft over $5000 has been rebutted by Mr. V.\n4. The RAD decides that Mr. V is excluded from refugee protection because he did not rebut the presumption that the crime of theft over $5000 which he committed is a serious non-political crime.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] Mr. V's allegations can be summarized as follows: Mr. V grew up being humiliated, harassed and bullied because of his effeminate nature. He realized that he was attracted to other boys. He was sexually abused by his aunt's husband as a child. After XXXX, Mr. V entered a seminary where he was sexually abused by a local priest. Mr. V's mother and sister did not approve of his same-sex orientation.\n[4] In 2012, Mr. V married a woman who he paid to sponsor him for permanent residency in the USA and he went to work for XXXX XXXX in Pennsylvania. A co-worker named XXXX asked him to help sell some old garment buttons, so Mr. V opened an eBay account and put them up for auction. In XXXX 2014, XXXX advised Mr. V that the buttons were stolen goods and the police were looking for Mr. V. XXXX threatened to harm him and his mother if he told the police that he got the buttons from XXXX, so he gave any unsold buttons back to XXXX and fled the USA for Nicaragua where he faced persecution due to his sexual orientation.\n[5] Mr. V travelled to Canada in XXXX 2015, found a job in XXXX and started to engage in same-sex relationships here. Mr. V's USA green card expired in XXXX 2015 so he could not go back to the USA. He filed a refugee claim in December 2020.\nRPD FINDINGS\n[6] The RPD made the following findings to support the panel's conclusion that there are serious reasons for considering that Mr. V committed a serious non-political crime while outside Canada and is therefore excluded from refugee protection:\n1. The crime committed by Mr. V was theft over $5000 pursuant to S 322(1) and 334(a)(i) of the Canadian Criminal Code (CCC) for which the sentence can be up to ten years imprisonment.\n2. A conviction of the crime is not required in order to make an exclusion finding.\n3. Mr. V's story about XXXX involvement in securing and selling the buttons is not credible.\n4. Mr. V. displayed wilful blindness which is included in the mens rea element for theft.\n5. His position of trust, the irreplaceable nature of the stolen property and Mr. V's immediate flight from the USA are aggravating circumstances, which outweigh the mitigating circumstances of an absence of violence, alcohol and drugs.\n6. Following a consideration of the Jayasekara factors, the presumption of seriousness of Mr. V's crime has not been rebutted.\n7. Since there was no evidence as to what an appropriate sentence would be, sentencing range is a neutral factor in the consideration of seriousness.\nAPPELLANT'S POSITION\n[7] The Appellant's Memorandum (AM) argues that the RPD breached natural justice by not considering Mr. V's submissions on intent, which is a required element of the crime. It submits that the panel made errors of fact with respect to the aggravating factors and asserts that the lack of prosecution in the USA is a mitigating factor. The AM faults the RPD for failing to consider Mr. V's explanations for XXXX involvement in the button selling scheme.\nMINISTER'S POSITION\n[8] The Minister intervened at the RAD to argue that the RPD correctly evaluated the elements of the crime, including an acknowledgement of Mr. V's intent, but was not required to make a determination of his guilt. The Minister contends that Mr. V being left alone without supervision at his employer's residence directly contradicts his claim that he was not a trusted employee.\nANALYSIS\n[9] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1 My independent assessment of the evidence provides serious reasons for considering that Mr. V committed the offence of theft over $5000 which is presumed serious due to the potential ten-year sentence. I determine that the presumption of seriousness of the crime is not rebutted after an evaluation of the Jayasekara factors and there is insufficient evidence to find where on the range of sentences that Mr. V's offence might fall. I conclude that Mr. V is excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Convention).2\nEXCLUSION\n[10] Section 98 of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)3 provides:\nA person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[11] Subsection 1F(b) of Article 1 of the Convention provides:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee\n[12] While crimes attracting a maximum sentence of ten years or more will generally be sufficiently serious to warrant exclusion, the guideline should not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized or unjust manner. I must consider whether the presumption of seriousness is rebutted through an evaluation of several factors, including the facts and elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction.4\n[13] The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) provided additional guidance in holding that where a CCC provision has a large sentencing range with the upper end being ten years or more, a claimant whose crime would fall at the less serious end of the range in Canada should not be presumptively excluded.5 The Court added sentencing range as an additional consideration when determining whether the crime committed is serious.\n[14] In assessing the seriousness of Mr. V's crimes, I will consider both an assessment of the relevant Jayasekara factors and an assessment of where on the sentencing range Mr. V's conduct would likely fall if committed in Canada.\nThe dollar value element of the crime is established to be over $5,000\n[15] The RPD determined that the crime committed by Mr. V was theft over $5000 pursuant to S 322(1) and 334(a)(i) of the CCC for which the sentence can be up to ten years imprisonment. The RPD considered counsel's submissions not to amalgamate the sale purchases so that the value element should be based on individual sale values for the buttons which never amounted to more than $800 per week with the largest single sale at $1800.\n[16] The panel preferred the numbers in the criminal complaint showing eBay transactions that totalled $24,300 and a police report indicating the owner's estimate of value in excess of $100,000. The RPD found there was no evidence to support the proposition that there was more than one theft, only that there was more than one date of sale.\n[17] Counsel for Mr. V did not contest the value element in the AM or in the subsequent Reply Memorandum (RM). I note that Mr. V testified that the money received was a \"...bit over $5,000...\".6 I agree with the RPD that for the purposes of criminal law, there was one theft here and the relevant figure is the aggregate value which can be manifested by the total money received for the stolen property. While the exact value of these items may be difficult to peg, all the evidence suggests that it exceeds $5000 in the aggregate. I determine that the value element of the crime of theft over $5000 has been satisfied.\nThe RPD was wrong to say that the panel did not have to identify each element of the offence\n[18] The RPD described how Mr. V admitted to selling the buttons on eBay but said he did not know they were stolen by XXXX who had approached him to sell them in return for a 40% commission. The panel addressed counsel's submission that Mr. V did not have the requisite intent to commit the offence because he did not know the items were stolen. The RPD said that intent was not required here, citing case-law that each element of the offence does not need to be identified.7 Even so, the RPD went on to note that mens rea for theft includes wilful blindness which imputes knowledge to an accused whose suspicion should be aroused to make further inquiries.\n[19] The RPD found much of Mr. V's testimony about his arrangement with XXXX to be not credible and that it was more likely than not that Mr. V was wilfully blind to the stolen nature of the items, and he failed to exercise due diligence. Mr. V says he did not ask where the buttons came from, gave money directly to XXXX each week and he never saw any of the commission over the six months he was selling them. The panel did not believe him and after a review of the police documents provided by the Minister, determined that there were serious reasons for considering that Mr. V committed the offence of theft over $5000.\n[20] The AM argues that the RPD relied on an older case to find that the panel did not have to identify each element of the offence, while the more recent case of Jayasekara requires an evaluation of those elements in determining the seriousness of a crime.\n[21] The Minister counters that there is a distinction between identifying each element and evaluating each element as required by Jayasekara. I disagree because the RM is right that an element needs to be identified first in order for it to be evaluated. I agree with the RM that the RPD was wrong about not needing to identify the elements of a crime because each element must be satisfied for the crime to exist. I will independently identify and evaluate the elements of the crime of theft over $5000. I have already determined that the value element has been satisfied to the exclusion standard of serious reasons for considering.\nMr. V's explanations are not persuasive in light of the police evidence which provided serious reasons for considering that he committed all the elements of the crime\n[22] The RPD relied on the Minister's evidence to find there were sufficient facts on which it was reasonable to find that there are serious reasons for considering that Mr. V had committed the offence of theft over $5000.\n[23] The AM contends that the panel's failure to consider Mr. V's submissions on his lack of intent to commit theft was a denial of natural justice as well as reviewable error. According to those submissions, after Mr. V learned that the buttons were stolen, he returned the remaining buttons to XXXX in order to protect himself and his mother from XXXX, and he was not thinking of depriving the true owner of her property.\n[24] The evidence for Mr. V's crime consists of: a Pennsylvania Police Criminal Complaint which includes an Affidavit of Probable Cause; a XXXX Police Incident Report and Wanted Person Circular; and a Pennsylvania Arrest Warrant. There are 35 pages of information with various notations alleging: knowledge that property is proceeds of an illegal act; theft by unlawful taking or disposition; unlawfully took or exercised unlawful control over movable property with intent to deprive the owner thereof; intentionally received, retained or disposed of movable property belonging to another, with no intent to restore it to the owner, knowing or believing that it had probably been stolen. It is clear that the police in Pennsylvania think they had probable cause to believe that Mr. V had the requisite intent or knowledge that he was dealing with stolen property.\n[25] There is a fulsome description from the officer who investigated and interviewed the victim XXXX XXXX that: Mr. V was a trusted employee for 15 years who enjoyed full access to the household; many stolen items were listed by an eBay user named \"XXXX\"; the value of transactions listed totalled $24,300; the eBay active listings were soon pulled and prior listings made not-viewable; Mr. V's Facebook settings were changed to private; Mr. V's cell phone number was cancelled; Mr. V failed to report for work the next day; a return address post office box number on a package containing stolen items was listed to Mr. V.\n[26] There are some other interesting notations in the documents; XXXX had filed a previous theft report regarding missing cash and personal items, unsure of who the culprit was; Mr. V's cousin XXXX was aware of the current situation because her husband XXXX also works for XXXX and he has previously accused Mr. V of stealing from her; Mr. V's brother XXXX revealed that his father had previously accused Mr. V of wrongdoing involving a credit card issued to his father; a a man in Toronto is also looking for Mr. V because he stole from his company while working as a foreman there.\n[27] The Minister submitted to the RPD that Mr. V attempted to cover up his activity when he became aware police were involved. The police evidence raises some questions regarding covering up the crime or a guilty mind such as why would Mr. V need to use an alias if he was innocently selling items on eBay for a co-worker? After finding out the buttons were stolen, why try to immediately hide all the evidence of the sales, change Facebook settings, cancel a cell number, quit work and run away to Nicaragua, instead of co-operating with police to apprehend the real culprit, XXXX?\n[28] Neither the AM or the RM address these questions beyond the submissions that the RPD failed to consider Mr. V's explanations of threats to Mr. V's life and his mother's life by XXXX. I have conducted an independent assessment of all the evidence, including reading the transcript and listening to large portions of the audio recordings of the RPD hearing. I have considered Mr. V's explanations and surmise that they might provide some basis for a defence were Mr. V to stand trial where the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. That is not the standard here and I determine that Mr. V's testimony and explanations are simply not enough to discount the voluminous police evidence that provide serious reasons for considering that he did commit the crime.\nRPD based wilful blindness finding on evidence and not conjecture\n[29] Despite the misstep of saying it did not need to consider intent, the RPD proceeded to acknowledge that the required mens rea for theft includes intent by finding that Mr. V was wilfully blind to the prospect that the buttons were stolen property.\n[30] The Minister disagrees with the AM proposition that the issue is guilt under the criminal law and correctly cites that the RPD does not determine guilt or innocence. I disagree with the RM's argument that the RPD conducted an improper evaluation of guilt because it based its conclusion on conjecture. The RM complains that the RPD imposed its subjective views in rendering this finding rather than basing it on the facts. I disagree because the RPD was not undertaking an evaluation of Mr. V's guilt or innocence but considering whether the elements of the crime were satisfied to the standard of serious reasons for considering. I find the panel's subjective view in rendering that finding was based on the facts presented and I agree with it.\n[31] In my view, the RPD evaluated the element of intent sufficiently, not so as to declare Mr. V's guilt or innocence, but to meet the much lesser standard that there were serious reasons for considering that he committed the offence. I find that the panel evaluated the element of intent or mens rea in its finding that Mr. V was wilfully blind and that finding was based on an evaluation of the evidence and not conjecture.\n[32] I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and submissions on this issue, and I agree with the RPD's evaluation of the elements of the crime of theft over $5000. I determine that the panel correctly concluded that there are serious reasons for considering that Mr. V committed the offence. I further make the uncontested finding that this offence is presumed to be a serious crime due to the potential ten-year sentence.\nLack of prosecution is not a factor to consider in determining seriousness\n[33] The Federal Court set out factors to consider in the determination of whether a presumption of seriousness can be rebutted:\nI believe there is a consensus among the courts that the interpretation of the exclusion clause in Article 1F(b) of the Convention, as regards the seriousness of a crime, requires an evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction: see S v. Refugee Status Appeals Authority, (N.Z. C.A.), supra; S and Others v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, [2006] EWCA Civ 1157 (Royal Courts of Justice, England); Miguel-Miguel v. Gonzales, no. 05-15900, (U.S. Ct of Appeal, 9th circuit), August 29, 2007, at pages 10856 and 10858. In other words, whatever presumption of seriousness may attach to a crime internationally or under the legislation of the receiving state, that presumption may be rebutted by reference to the above factors.8\n[34] The RPD stated that the Minister does not have to prove that Mr. V was charged with or convicted of the acts attributed to him in order for the exclusion clause to apply. The panel found that Mr. V was not prosecuted in the USA because the police were unable to find him since he fled to Nicaragua upon hearing that they were looking for him. The panel found that the fact Mr. V was not prosecuted is not a mitigating circumstance, but his flight from the USA is an aggravating circumstance.\n[35] The AM contends that the RPD erred by speculating that Mr. V was not prosecuted because of his departure from the USA, and this is inconsistent with the evidence which indicates that an individual subject to criminal charges will be tried in absentia in Pennsylvania. The RM also notes that the USA government is aware that Mr. V is here and has made no efforts to have him extradited. Counsel concludes that the offence in question is not a serious crime, because if it were considered serious by USA authorities, they would have requested Canada to detain and extradite him.\n[36] I think that the AM mischaracterizes the law in Pennsylvania as mandatory. The provision is actually permissive in that a defendant may by tried in absentia. In my view, neither the fact that Mr. V has not been tried in absentia or that he has not been extradited has any relevance to the exclusion analysis. The law is clear that exclusion is not limited to fugitives and also does not depend on whether there has been a charge or conviction. Mode of prosecution is only a factor when there has been a prosecution. The absence of a prosecution is not a factor for consideration in rebutting the presumption of seriousness.\nMitigating and aggravating factors do not rebut the presumption of seriousness\n[37] The RPD determined that Mr. V's position of trust, the irreplaceable nature of the stolen property and his immediate flight from the USA are aggravating circumstances, which outweigh the mitigating circumstances of an absence of violence, alcohol and drugs.\n[38] The AM argues that the RPD made an error of fact about the number of years that Mr. V worked for XXXX and the panel relied on that to find that his position of trust was an aggravating factor. The AM submits that Mr. V was a XXXX and XXXX and was in no position of trust so it could not be an aggravating factor. I do not think that the number of years that Mr. V worked for XXXX is all that important. The evidence is that during his tenure working for her, he had access to the house unaccompanied, which is the key determinant that he was trusted enough not to steal from her. I agree with the Minister that the fact that he was left alone in the house without supervision is an indicator he was a trusted employee. In my view, this breach of trust does constitute an aggravating factor.\n[39] Neither the AM or RM suggest any mitigating circumstances and my independent assessment is that there is insufficient evidence of anything mitigating that might assist to rebut the presumption of seriousness. After considering the Jayasekara factors, I determine that the presumption of seriousness has not been rebutted.\nRPD was correct that there is insufficient evidence to project a sentencing range\n[40] The RPD correctly considered the Supreme Court's guidance in Febles to try to determine whether Mr. V's hypothetical sentence in Canada would have fallen in the higher or lower end of the sentencing range. In my view, the panel was right to find it a neutral factor in the absence of any evidence on what the appropriate sentence might have been. Neither the AM nor the Minister provided any evidence or submissions on that issue, so I am also unable to estimate where in the range the sentence might have resided.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] I conclude that there are serious reasons for considering that Mr. V committed the offence of theft over $5000 which is presumed serious due to the potential ten-year sentence. I determine that the presumption of seriousness of the crime is not rebutted following an evaluation of the Jayasekara factors. I conclude that there are serious reasons for considering that Mr. V committed a serious non-political crime outside Canada and is therefore excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Convention.\n[42] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJoseph Wyger\nJoseph Wyger\nFebruary 17, 2023\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant \/ PA) and XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellant \/ AA) are citizens of China.\n[2] The PA and AA are siblings. Both the PA and the AA seek asylum based on their practice of Christianity. The PA fears consequences of having had a third child while the two-child family planning policy was still in place. Both of the Appellants described a history of physical and emotional abuse from their father and indicated that they have heard that their father has sworn to kill them.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that credibility and objective basis were determinative. Inconsistencies in the PA's Port of Entry (POE) interviews and her Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative and amended BOC narrative regarding how family planning officials became aware that she was pregnant were not reasonably explained, nor were omissions from her BOC narratives regarding receiving an order to undergo an abortion and going into hiding. The RPD found that country documentation does not indicate that the PA would be persecuted by Chinese authorities for having a third child. The RPD also found inconsistencies in the AA's POE interviews and his BOC narrative and amended BOC narrative about being detained by the police and how he was introduced to Christianity in China. The RPD found that the Appellants were not genuine Christians; although they displayed knowledge of Christianity, it was insufficient to overcome the significant credibility concerns. The RPD further found that neither Appellant has a sur place claim.\n[4] The Appellants argue that the RPD's analysis was microscopic in finding inconsistencies in their evidence and failed to consider their reasonable explanations. In addition, the Appellants argue that the RPD erred by failing to consider the evidence that establishes that they have serious mental health conditions, which could explain the inconsistencies and omissions. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by failing to apply the Gender Guideline1 in assessing the PA's claim regarding her father and also erred in assessing country documentation about consequences to the PA for having had a third child. The Appellants further argue that their evidence establishes that they are genuine Christians.\n[5] The determinative issue is credibility.\n[6] The RPD was correct in finding inconsistencies and omissions about central elements of their claims in the Appellants' POE interviews, their testimony and their original and amended BOC narratives, which were not reasonably explained. Contrary to the Appellants' argument, I find that the Appellants' medical conditions do not provide information that could reasonably explain omissions and inconsistencies in their evidence. Evidence of the Appellants' attendance at church services and their knowledge of Christianity are insufficient to overcome the serious credibility concerns. In addition, country documentation indicates that the PA does not have a forward-facing risk for having violated the previous two-child policy.\nDECISION\n[7] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[8] The Appellants submit the following as new evidence:\n(a) a letter from Reverend XXXX from the XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the PA, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n(b) a letter from Reverend XXXX from the XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the AA, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;\n(c) photographs of the AA's medical prescriptions; and\n(d) an affidavit of SF, sworn on XXXX XXXX, 2022.\n[9] According to the Law,2 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD's decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\nIf the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.3\nThe letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX are partially admitted\n[10] The letters from Rev. XXXX indicate that the PA and the AA joined the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" on XXXX XXXX, 2022 in Queens Park and that they have both continued to attend Sunday church services from XXXX to XXXX 2022. The information about the Appellants attending a parade was available prior to the RPD's decision dated XXXX XXXX, 2022. The Appellants have not indicated why that information was not reasonably available to submit before the RPD's decision. As a result, I do not admit the information about the Appellants' attendance at the parade. I do admit the information that indicates that the Appellants have continued to attend Sunday services between XXXX and XXXX 2022 as it is new, occurred after the RPD's decision and is relevant to the Appellants' allegations.\nPhotographs of prescriptions are not admitted\n[11] The photographs are of two medication containers with prescription labels for the AA attached. The labels indicate that the AA filled a prescription for XXXX and XXXX in XXXX 2022. While this is information that the prescriptions were filled after the RPD's decision, it is unclear to me how this information is relevant to the AA's claim, and I do not admit it. The fact that the AA takes medication prescribed by a physician that presumably is related to a mental health condition does not assist me in my independent review of the RPD's decision. I have set out below my review of the information about the AA's mental health condition and whether it can, as the Appellants argue, explain any of the inconsistencies and omissions in the AA's evidence. Even if I am wrong in not admitting this evidence, the fact that the AA filled prescriptions for these medications in XXXX 2022 would not change my decision in this appeal.\nThe affidavits from the AA and from SF are not admitted\n[12] In his affidavit, the AA indicates that he believes that the RPD made mistakes about his evidence regarding his friend, PC, which he believes are the result of the translation of a portion of his original BOC narrative and his testimony about his friend, PC. The AA further explains what he intended to communicate in his BOC narrative and in his testimony. SF, in his affidavit, states that he has reviewed the RPD's reasons and decision and understands that the RPD took issue with certain language in the AA's evidence. He explains that a particular character in the Chinese language can be translated into English as \"looking for\" or \"going to see\" a person and can mean doing so in person or online.\n[13] The Appellants submit that this evidence was only reasonably available once the AA received the RPD's reasons and decision. I disagree. A review of the transcript of the RPD hearing makes clear that the Appellants had notice of the interpretation of the AA's evidence from the RPD, and the AA, in response to questions from the RPD and his Counsel, testified that it was not what he had been trying to communicate.4 The AA acknowledges this in his affidavit:\nI understand that the RPD took issue with wording in my original narrative concerning [PC]. While I understand that it was translated that I went to him in person, that is not what occurred and I have explained this at my hearing.5\n[14] Since the Appellants were aware of this issue at the hearing, they had the opportunity to submit post-hearing evidence before the RPD's decision. If they required additional time to obtain such evidence, they had the opportunity to request additional time to obtain and then submit this evidence to the RPD. I do not admit these affidavits because I find that the information was reasonably available prior to the RPD's decision.\nREQUEST FOR ORAL HEARING DENIED\n[15] The Appellants request that an oral hearing be held. I may only hold an oral hearing where I have admitted new evidence and that evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the Appellants' credibility, that is central to the decision and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting their claims for protection. The evidence I have admitted pertains to the Appellants' continued attendance at church services between XXXX and XXXX 2022. This evidence does not raise a serious issue of credibility, is not central to the decision and would not justify allowing or rejecting the Appellants' claims. The request for an oral hearing is denied.\nANALYSIS\n[16] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.6 Having reviewed the record and the transcript of the hearing, I find that the RPD did not enjoy a meaningful advantage in assessing credibility. As a result, I am conducting my review on the standard of correctness.\n[17] In conducting my review, I am guided by the Gender Guideline.7\nEvidence about the Appellants' mental health conditions\n[18] Throughout their memorandum, the Appellants argue that the RPD failed to consider the evidence about their mental health conditions and how it may have helped to explain perceived discrepancies and issues in their testimony. They point out, for example, that:\n... [the PA's] medical report from Dr. [L] describes how in one of her previous employment positions as a cashier, she was unable to perform even basic tasks. She has reported poor concentration and memory issues to the extent that she cannot focus enough to watch television, read, or use a computer.8\n[19] With respect to the AA, the Appellants submit that there is ample evidence demonstrating his difficulties communicating and processing information. Other than arguing that the RPD failed to consider this information globally, the Appellants do not specify how their mental health conditions played a role in reasonably explaining inconsistencies and omissions in their evidence. I do, however, agree with the Appellants that there is evidence about their medical conditions that the RPD should have assessed to consider whether it could reasonably explain the credibility concerns in the Appellants' evidence.\nThe Principal Appellant\n[20] The Appellants submitted a medical certificate that indicates that the PA was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder on XXXX XXXX, 2019 at the Fujian Provincial Hospital; the treatment proposed was psychotherapy, reasonable exercise, work and rest and outpatient follow-up.9 The certificate does not indicate any symptoms or problems with concentration or memory issues. In her addendum to her BOC narrative, the PA describes suffering physical and emotional abuse from her father throughout her childhood, and she states that she attempted suicide in 2004. She also states that she was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in XXXX 2019 arising from her fear of being forced to undergo an abortion. The PA also states that she was diagnosed as suffering from chronic depression when she underwent medical assessments after she was involved in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in XXXX 2020 and states that her treatment involved therapy and medication. The Appellants submitted an undated letter from MF, a registered psychologist, who indicates that she is providing psychological counselling services to the PA in relation to the MVA.10\n[21] In addition, the Appellants submitted a copy of a multidisciplinary assessment report of the PA, which was requested by the insurer in order to determine what benefits the PA was owed from being involved in the MVA. Dr. L completed a psychological assessment of the PA on XXXX XXXX, 2021. The PA indicated that she took medication for pain and sleep and that her doctor had recently prescribed an anti-depressant for her. She reported concerns to Dr. L, including:\n(a) she has poor concentration and memory, and she cannot focus to watch TV, read or use the computer; and\n(b) she worked as a cashier at a supermarket for a month but had to stop because of the pain from standing for a long time and moving her wrist, and, also, she made many mistakes because of poor concentration.\nDr. L noted that the PA reported no history of, inter alia, psychiatric problems, abuses, or suicidal attempts.\n[22] The PA completed the following psychometric tests: the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Million Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III and the Multidimensional Pain Inventory. Dr. L noted that the PA's \"extremely elevated scores on the psychometric tests [that she completed] were inconsistent with [her] mildly dysthymic clinical presentation.\"11 Dr. L diagnosed the PA with Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood and Specific Phobia, Situational Type (Driving and passenger anxiety) as a result of the MVA. Dr. L recommended that the PA complete a course of twelve sessions of cognitive behavioural treatment, one hour per session, on a weekly basis. Dr. L indicated that prognosis was uncertain as it depended upon the PA's response to psychological intervention.\n[23] I note that Dr. L states that the PA denied having any pre-existing conditions, psychiatric problems, abuses or suicide attempts, which is contrary to the Medical Certificate and the health history that she described in her BOC narratives, as set out above. I also note that Dr. L's conclusion that the PA's scores on the psychological tests were extremely elevated when compared to her clinical presentation does give some indication that the PA's report about her cognitive concerns may have been exaggerated. This leaves me with concerns as to the accuracy and reliability of the information the PA reported to Dr. L.\n[24] In summary, the assessment was carried out in XXXX 2021, which is approximately two years after the PA arrived in Canada and 15 months prior to the RPD hearing. The report indicates that the PA was diagnosed with a situational adjustment disorder, with anxiety and depressed mood, arising from the MVA. This diagnosis is not consistent with the PA's statement in her amended BOC that she was diagnosed with chronic depression. As noted above, the undated letter from MF, a registered psychologist, indicates that she is providing counselling services to the PA; however, no further detail is provided. As such, it is unclear whether the PA completed the recommended treatment and\/or whether the treatment was successful. I note that Dr. L listed concentration concerns that the PA reported, but he did not identify any concentration concerns based on his clinical assessment, nor did he recommend that the PA receive further cognitive assessment. I also note there is nothing in the report indicating that the PA's condition could impact her memory or her ability to testify.\n[25] It is difficult to resolve the PA's denial of past psychological problems, abuse and suicidal ideation to Dr. L with the allegations about her mental health described in her BOC narratives. These inconsistencies also put into doubt the authenticity of the Medical Certificate, which purports to diagnose the PA with an anxiety disorder in XXXX 2019. I have considered whether I have a duty to confront the PA about these concerns and have concluded that I do not. The Federal Court stated in a recent case that the case law of this Court is unambiguous:\nAs a general principle, the rules of procedural fairness do not require refugee claimants to be confronted about information that they are aware of and which they have, in addition, provided themselves.12 [citations removed]\n[26] Overall, I find that there is no reliable information that indicates that the PA had a condition that could have impacted her memory upon arrival in Canada or in making her claim for protection. I also find that there is no information that demonstrates that the PA had a psychological condition that could have impacted her memory, concentration or her ability to testify at the RPD hearing in XXXX 2022. Nonetheless, I have considered this information in my review of the credibility findings in this appeal.\nThe Associate Appellant\n[27] In his original BOC narrative, the AA describes being shocked and emotionally devasted when his girlfriend broke up with him.13 In his updated BOC narrative, the AA describes physical and emotional abuse by his father throughout his childhood as well as having suicidal ideation and attempts after his girlfriend broke up with him. The AA also states that he had a flashback to traumatic events in XXXX 2021 and planned to commit suicide by jumping into a river but was persuaded not to by his aunt.14\n[28] Medical documents indicate that the AA was admitted to hospital on an involuntary basis due to concerns about self harm on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021. The AA was diagnosed with depression with suicidal ideation and a major depressive disorder,15 and he was discharged from the hospital in a medically stable state with prescribed medication and a referral for ambulatory services.16\n[29] In my view, there is no medical information that indicates that the AA had a mental health condition that could have impacted his memory when he arrived in Canada or when he made his claim for protection. I acknowledge the seriousness of the AA's acute mental health condition in early 2021; however, there is no medical information that suggests that the AA had a mental health condition that could have impacted his memory or ability to testify at the RPD hearing in XXXX 2022. Nonetheless, I have considered this information in my review of the credibility findings in this appeal.\nTHE PRINCIPAL APPELLANT'S CLAIM\nFindings that are not disputed\nOmissions from Basis of Claim narrative\n[30] The Appellants do not dispute the RPD's finding that the PA did not provide a reasonable explanation for why she omitted from her BOC narrative and addendum to her BOC narrative that she had gone into hiding and that the authorities had continuously searched for her before she left China. The RPD drew a negative credibility inference and found, on a balance of probabilities, that the PA did not go into hiding and that the family planning authorities did not search for her.\n[31] I have conducted an independent review, and I find no error in the RPD's findings. I agree with the RPD that the omissions are significant and central to the PA's claim because they are relevant to the circumstances in which she fled China and her alleged persecutor's continuing interest in locating her. I concur in the findings and draw a negative credibility inference on that basis.\nInconsistent evidence about Christianity\n[32] The RPD drew a negative credibility inference from the PA's inconsistent statements in POE interviews and her written declaration as well as in her BOC form and BOC narrative about being a Christian and attending church. I have reviewed the RPD record, and the transcript of the hearing, and I find no error in the RPD's conclusion.\nInconsistencies in how authorities became aware of the Principal Appellant's third pregnancy are not reasonably explained\n[33] The RPD found that inconsistencies between the PA's POE interviews and written declaration, and her original and amended BOC narratives about how Chinese authorities became aware that she was pregnant with a third child were not reasonably explained. The RPD also found that the PA's omission from her original BOC narrative that family planning officials visited her home and delivered a notice that she was required to undergo an abortion was also not reasonably explained. The Appellants argue that the PA's explanation about the POE interviews and her written declaration is reasonable and that, when considered together with her testimony, the PA's evidence is not in conflict. The Appellants further argue that the Federal Court has instructed that POE statements are to be treated with caution and that the impact of the PA's psychological health should be considered. I disagree.\n[34] In two POE interviews on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, 2019,17 and in a written declaration dated XXXX XXXX, 2019,18 the PA stated that, when she became pregnant, she was in a bad mood, and a friend introduced her to a house church; she attended only a few times before the police raided the house church and accused her of attending a cult gathering. She stated that the police detained her for seven days and that, when they physically assaulted her, she disclosed that she was pregnant. She further stated that the police knew she already had two children and told her to have an abortion.\n[35] In her original BOC narrative, the PA stated that, after she became pregnant in XXXX 2018:\nI sought authorization from the family planning authorities for our third child. The family planning authorities denied me authorization on the basis that China still had a two-child limit. They pressured me to get an abortion now. They said that I could get pregnant in the future if China changes to a three-child policy. They threatened that if I have the baby before the official change, I will be heavily fined and sterilized.19\nShe stated, \"I left the family planning office in tears\" and that later, she and her husband agreed that she should leave China with the assistance of a \"snakehead\". The PA then indicates that the \"snakehead\" told her to tell Canadian authorities that she was detained and assaulted for being at an illegal house church. The \"snakehead\" also specifically instructed the PA not to disclose that she was pregnant and that she wanted to have her child born in Canada; he told her that, if she did tell Canadian authorities that she was pregnant, she would be deported immediately. The PA then states that she followed the \"snakehead's\" advice and wrote an untruthful statement about being detained for attending an illegal house church, and she apologizes for being untruthful.\n[36] In her addendum to her BOC narrative, the PA states that she is unsure how the family planning authorities found out that she was pregnant, but she believes the hospital doctor reported it to them. She states:\n... Because this was my third child, I required a permit allowing me to give birth again. On XXXX XXXX 2019, two Family Planning officials came to my home. They delivered a notice in writing and ordered me to abort the baby, or I would be facing serious consequences. I did not follow the order and I decided to go ahead and have the baby. Although I felt good about my decision, I suffered from intense depression afterwards. On XXXX XXXX, 2019, I went to see a doctor who diagnosed me as suffering from an anxiety disorder arising from my fear that the Family Planning authorities would force me to undergo an abortion.\nI have described the circumstances of that visit in my original Basis of Claim as well as the steps I took after that to flee to Canada in XXXX 2019.20\n[37] At the hearing, the PA testified that she sought authorization for her third child after she became pregnant:\nPanel: Did you ever seek authorization after you became pregnant?\nPA: After the family and planning officers came to my home, wanted me to go for abortion, my husband and me, and I, went to the family and planning office one more time. I pled to them, could you please treat me leniently and give me a chance to have a third child? They said, no. They wanted me to get abortion and after, after it is allowed to have third child, you could get pregnant again.\nPanel: When was it that you and your husband went to the family planning office to do\nthis?\nPA: After they got to know I was pregnant and came to my home to give, to give me notice, my husband and I wanted to go there to try one more time to make, to request, make a request to them whether they, they would be able to give me, give us another chance to have another child.21\n[38] The RPD asked the PA to explain the discrepancies, specifically, why had she described three different versions of how Chinese authorities became aware that she was pregnant. The PA stated that she lied to border officials because the \"snakehead\" had told her to, and she was scared of being deported. When asked why she did not mention in her original BOC narrative that family planning officers had visited her home and given her a notice to undergo an abortion, the PA stated, \"Yes, at that time I forgot and also, my previous lawyer did not ask me for details and I did not know that if I mention this, it will be helpful to my case.\"22 The PA also later testified that because she had just arrived in Canada, she did not understand the questions in the BOC and that she has a better understanding and a better summary now that she has been in Canada for three years.23\n[39] I agree with the Appellants and the RPD, both of whom note that POE statements should be treated with caution. I have also considered that the PA had just arrived in Canada and had allegedly been recently diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I find, however, that the PA's explanation for her untruthful statements about being detained by police for attending an illegal house church and disclosing to the police that she was pregnant when they assaulted her are not reasonable. Despite being advised by the \"snakehead\" that she would be deported if they knew she was pregnant, the PA alleged that she was detained after attending an illegal house church and also disclosed that she was pregnant and in violation of the family planning policy. It is difficult to understand why the PA was scared of being deported and therefore untruthfully told Canadian authorities about being detained by the police for attending an illegal house church when she also disclosed that she was pregnant, which was what the \"snakehead\" told her that, if she did so, she would be immediately deported.\n[40] As I noted above, I have concerns as to the authenticity of the Medical Certificate, which indicates that the PA was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in XXXX 2019, as it is inconsistent with information the PA reported to Dr. L. I afford it no weight. Even if I am wrong in concluding that the Medical Certificate is not, on a balance of probabilities, authentic, there is no information in the document that would explain why the PA would take such a grave risk and disclose her pregnancy, contrary to the advice of the \"snakehead\". I also note that, since the PA disclosed that she was pregnant, there seems to be no reason to add the untruthful information about attending an illegal house church.\n[41] I note that the Appellants do not specifically dispute the RPD's finding that the PA omitted from her original BOC narrative that family planning officials attended her home and gave her a notice to undergo an abortion. The Appellants refer to the RPD's rejection of the PA's explanation about the issues that she had with explaining her story when she first arrived in Canada. They note that the RPD held that the questions on the BOC form are set out clearly and in simple language, even though the PA does not understand English. I disagree. As the RPD noted, the PA's claim was completed with the assistance of an interpreter and includes the interpreter's declaration. The PA was also assisted by experienced legal counsel. It is difficult to understand how the PA could forget a home visit from family planning officials, who delivered a notice requiring her to undergo an abortion that is alleged to have occurred approximately two months earlier and is the basis of her claim for asylum.\n[42] Having reviewed the record and the transcript of the RPD hearing, I am also not persuaded that the PA's original BOC narrative and the addendum to her BOC narrative, when read together, are not in conflict. I note that, in her original BOC narrative as set out above, the PA states, \"I sought authorization from the family planning authorities...\" and that, \"I left the family planning office in tears...\" The only reference to the PA's husband is that, later, she and her husband talked over their options and agreed that she should leave China. This language indicates that the PA went to the family planning office alone to seek authorization.\n[43] In her addendum to her BOC narrative, as set out above, the PA states that two family planning officials came to her home and delivered a notice that required her to undergo an abortion. She states that she did not follow their order, and although she felt her decision was the right one, she became depressed and saw a doctor who diagnosed her with anxiety in early XXXX 2019. She then states that she described the circumstances of that visit and the steps she took to flee China. There is no mention of any attendance at the family planning office. In her testimony, the PA stated that it was only after the notice was delivered that she and her husband attended the family planning office to request authorization. I note that the PA testified that, \"...my husband and me, and I, went to the family and planning office one more time.\"24 [emphasis added] This language suggests that this was not the PA's first visit to the family planning office, which is internally inconsistent and inconsistent with the PA's original BOC narrative and her addendum to her BOC narrative. I find that the two narratives and the PA's testimony are in conflict with each other and are not reasonably explained.\n[44] In summary, I find that the PA has not reasonably explained the inconsistencies in the POE interviews and in her written declaration with the BOC narratives about how authorities learned that she was pregnant. The omission from the PA's original BOC narrative about family planning officers attending her home and delivering a notice that she was required to undergo an abortion is also not reasonably explained. The inconsistencies and omission are significant as they relate to central elements of the PA's claim: when officials learned of her third pregnancy, and how, as well as receiving official direction to undergo an abortion, which was delivered to her home. I find no error in the RPD's findings.\nThe omission of the PA's fear of her father is not reasonably explained\n[45] The RPD drew a negative credibility inference from the PA's omission from her original BOC narrative that her father had threatened to kill her. The Appellants argue that the RPD failed to apply the Gender Guideline in reaching this conclusion. I agree that the RPD did not apply the Gender Guideline; however, I do not find that the RPD erred.\n[46] In the addendum to her BOC narrative, the PA described the abuse she suffered from her father and that, after she had a second daughter, he called her and threatened to beat her to death because she had made him lose face.25 In her testimony, the PA stated that one of the reasons she fears returning to China is that her father has always threatened that he would kill her if he saw her.26 When asked why she did not mention this in her original BOC narrative, she stated that she has not wanted to tell anyone about the abuse from a very young age.\n[47] The Appellants argue that the Gender Guideline cautions against stereotypes, specifically the myth that survivors would discuss abuse with family members or acquaintances. They argue that the RPD discredited her for not discussing her abuse with people who are not close to her. I do not find the argument to be persuasive. In my view, a trauma-informed assessment of the omission still results in an explanation that is not reasonable. I note that the AA stated in the update to his BOC narrative that, after the Appellants arrived in Canada, their aunt told them that their father had publicly threatened to kill them and their mother if they returned to China.27 The AA's statement indicates that the PA would have recently learned about this threat. I accept and acknowledge that discussing past abuse is difficult; however, I find that it is reasonable to expect that the PA would have at least mentioned generally in her original BOC narrative that her father recently and publicly threatened to kill her.\n[48] I also apply this reasoning to the PA's explanation for failing to inform Dr. L in her psychological assessment that she suffered abuse throughout her childhood. I accept and acknowledge that discussing past abuse may be extremely difficult; however, in the context of the psychological assessment, I find it is reasonable to expect that the PA would, at a minimum, confirm that she has a history of abuse as well as a psychiatric history. I find no error in the RPD's conclusion and drawing negative inferences as to the PA's credibility as a result.\nThe presumption of truthfulness is rebutted\n[49] Given that the omissions and inconsistences discussed above are not reasonably explained, that the PA has submitted an inauthentic medical certificate, the undisputed finding that the PA omitted from her original BOC narrative that she went into hiding, and that family planning officials continued to visit her home before she left China, I find that the presumption of truthfulness of the PA's evidence has been rebutted. The omissions and inconsistencies relate to material elements of the PA's claim for protection based on her contravention of the family planning policy and her alleged fear of her father.\nThe Principal Appellant's Documentation\n[50] As discussed above, I have found, on a balance of probabilities, that the PA has submitted an inauthentic medical certificate and that the presumption of truth as to her credibility has been rebutted.\n[51] With respect to the notice from the birth planning office, I agree with the Appellants that the RPD did not give notice about its specific concerns about the document itself: that the notice is a black and white copy of a typed document, and the only security feature is a black stamp. I also agree that the PA's use of fraudulent documents to come to Canada is irrelevant to the assessment of the notice. In my independent assessment, I note that the PA has already submitted an inauthentic medical certificate. I also note the PA's omission from her original BOC narrative that she had received a notice was not reasonably explained. Considering these findings, I give the notice medium weight. The letter from the Appellants' mother does not contain any corroborative information about the PA's claim under the family planning policy.\n[52] Considering the totality of the evidence, I find that the documentation is insufficient to overcome the significant credibility concerns. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the PA has failed to establish that family planning officers gave her a notice to undergo a forced abortion.\nCountry documentation\n[53] The Appellants argue that the RPD's assessment of country documentation was unduly narrow, and the RPD erred in finding that the PA does not have a forward-facing risk for having had a third child while the two-child policy was in effect. They argue that there is limited information about the consequences for parents who had a third child prior to the three-child policy being implemented in 2021; however, they argue that there is ample evidence of the repercussions that parents who have violated the one-child policy and the two-child policy. I am not persuaded that the RPD's analysis of the country documentation is in error.\n[54] In my review of country documentation in the National Documentation Package (NDP), I note the following from the U.S. Department of State report on Human Rights Practices for 2021 in China:\nThe law restricts most married couples to three children (increased from two in May) and allows couples to apply for permission to have a fourth child if they meet local and provincial requirements. In August the NPC formally passed the law raising the number of children permitted, including several provisions aimed at boosting the birth rate and \"reducing the burden\" of raising children. These provisions included abolishing the \"social maintenance fee\" that was a fine for having children beyond the previous limit, encouraging local governments to offer parental leave, and increasing women's employment rights.28 [emphasis added]\nThis is a clear statement that fines for having had children beyond the previous limit are now abolished.\n[55] I note that the Appellants have not disputed the RPD's additional rationale for finding that the PA does not have a forward-facing risk, which is that the PA's husband has faced no risk in having their third child in China. The PA testified that her husband applied for and obtained a visa to bring their son to China, and he has not had any problems from Chinese authorities. I find that this is compelling evidence because country documentation indicates that family planning law applies to married couples.29\nNo serious possibility of persecution for having breached two-child policy\n[56] In summary, I find that the PA does not face a serious possibility of persecution for having had a third child prior to the implementation of the third-child policy.\nThe Principal Appellant is not a genuine Christian\n[57] In addition to the above-noted undisputed finding that the PA's inconsistent evidence about being a Christian and attending church, the RPD found that the PA's explanation about beginning to attend church in XXXX 2021 was plausible but lacked detail. The RPD also found that the timing of the PA's interest in Christianity was suspicious as it was around the same time as the Chinese government announced the three-child policy and that it was likely that the PA attended church to bolster her claim. The RPD found that there was documentation to support the PA's attendance at church and that she was baptised, and it also found that the PA had good knowledge of Christianity. However, the RPD concluded that the PA's knowledge and the corroborative documentation was insufficient to overcome the significant credibility concerns and found that the PA was not a genuine Christian.\n[58] The Appellants argue that the PA gave sufficient details about her conversion to Christianity and that the PA's knowledge and corroborative documentation is sufficient to find that she is a genuine Christian. The Appellants also argue that the RPD was incorrect to conclude that the PA bolstered her claim based on the three-child policy.\n[59] Having completed an independent assessment, I find that the RPD did err in suspecting that the PA was bolstering her claim given the timing of the three-child policy. As the Appellants point out and country documentation confirms, the three-child policy was announced in May 2021, which is after the PA began to attend church. I find, however, that the error is not determinative.\n[60] I find that the RPD correctly concluded that the PA's knowledge and attendance at church are insufficient to overcome the very significant concerns about the PA's credibility. Although it is an undisputed finding, it is helpful to consider the significant inconsistencies in the PA's evidence between her POE interviews and declaration, and her BOC form and BOC narratives that were not reasonably explained. In her first POE interview, the PA describes beginning to attend a house church based on a friend's introduction and that, on her third visit to the church, the police came and detained her for seven days at the police station. In her written declaration, which she completed on the same date as the first POE interview, the PA stated:\nA friend recommended that I go to a church to listen to the guidance of the pastor. After attending church, I felt that what the pastor said made a lot of sense, so I started going to the church together with my friend to do volunteer work.\nThe first time I went was on XXXX XXXX, 2019. I did some cleaning at the church and also spent some time handing out pamphlets. It made me feel happy to see my fellow churchgoers devoutly praying and reading scriptures, and I therefore became a member.\nMy second visit was on XXXX XXXX, 2019. We prayed and read scriptures together, and then we did some cleaning together.\nDuring my third visit on XXXX XXXX, 2019, while we were doing some cleaning after our religious service, a group of police officers suddenly stormed in. They took us to a police substation. I asked them why they were taking us away. They said that we were participating in cult-related activities.30\n[61] In her BOC form where the claimant's religion is asked, the PA stated \"None.\"31 In her original BOC narrative, the PA stated that she was untruthful about being arrested for being discovered at a house church because the \"snakehead\" had advised her to say that. In her amended narrative, the PA states she was depressed after the MVA, and her brother encouraged her to try Christianity in XXXX 2021.32\n[62] At the hearing, the PA testified that she sometimes attended church with her brother, but she was not interested in it, she attended to support him. She further testified about her introduction to Christianity:\nMs. XXXX: It was on XXXX XXXX, 2020 after in a car accident. My little brother and my psychologist...\nInterpreter: Let me finish.\nMs. XXXX: ...suggested, give me a suggestion that to go to believe in Christianity and also, and my little brother told me a lot about Jesus story and I saw that he changed a lot. Previously, he did not like to talk. His personality is a very, like, quiet and now he communicate to me, with me a lot and then he became a happier person. So, I saw his changes so I, I wanted to try to believe in Jesus. After trying, I, I feel that it is very much help or very much helpful to my, my psychological trauma.\nPanel: Since when have you yourself considered yourself to be a Christian?\nMs. XXXX: I myself feel that I truly became a Christian that it was in two, 2021.\nPanel: Why since this date? What is the significance of this date?\nMs. XXXX: It was around XXXX 2021. I was, I was always taking the online class, classes of Christianity. In the beginning, I was not very interested in the class. After a while, I felt that some stories was touching to me. And with my psychologist or my counselling therapist, every time when I talk with him or her, every time when I talk with her, we would talk about church and Christianity knowledge.33\n[63] I agree with the RPD that the PA's testimony about her conversion to Christianity lacks detail given her earlier lack of interest in it. I acknowledge the PA's baptism certificate and the photographs of her at church. I also note that Reverend XXXX's letter states that the PA \"was to attend our service since XXXX XXXX, 2021\", that she participates in the volunteer program and has shown commitment to his zoom sessions. I find, however, that the PA's attendance at church and her knowledge are insufficient to overcome the serious credibility findings. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the PA is not a genuine Christian.\nTHE ASSOCIATE APPELLANT'S CLAIM\nInconsistencies in the Associate Appellant's evidence about his introduction to Christianity and his actions after being released from detention are not reasonably explained\n[64] The RPD found that the AA's original BOC and his amended BOC were inconsistent about who took him to attend the house church for the first time, and not reasonably explained. The RPD also found that the AA's testimony that he \"went to\" his friend, PC, after he was released was inconsistent with his testimony that PC lives in the United States, was not in China while he was detained and was not a member of the house church. The Appellants argue that the AA's statement in his original BOC was unintended and is related to translation. The Appellants also argue that the RPD was overly restrictive in interpreting the language in the AA's original BOC. The Appellants also argue that the AA's testimony about going to his friend is also related to translation and therefore reasonably explained. I disagree.\n[65] In his original BOC narrative, the AA states:\n6. In XXXX 2019, my good friend, [PC] came to visit me. He talked to me about the Christian faith and how it could help me. He told me that I would gain inner strength and peace of mind from becoming a Christian like him. My friend said Christianity will give me the confidence to achieve my dreams and overcome life's challenges.\n7. My friend encouraged me to meet his fellow believers at the house church. He told me that they were really kind and supportive.\n8. My friend told me that their church was underground because they did not want to register and be controlled by the Chinese government.\n9. In XXXX 2019, I went with my friend to his house church. The members of his house church were very kind. They encouraged me to take up Christianity.34 [emphasis added]\n[66] In his amended BOC narrative, the AA states: \"[o]n XXXX XXXX, 2019, through the introduction of one of my few friends, [PC], I attended a church service at a house church...\"35\n[67] At the hearing, the AA testified that the beginning of his religious learning in China began when he \"was taken to the church by [CY]\"36 and that PC was not a member of the house church. The RPD inquired about the inconsistency:\nPanel: In your original narrative, you've said that in, in XXXX 2019, [PC] came to your home and spoke with you about Christianity but today and in your updated narrative, you said that through the introduction of [PC], you actually went to church with someone else, I believe, [CY], if I remember his name correctly? Sorry, [CY]. Can you explain that?\nMr. XXXX: I didn't have a clear mind at that time so my expression may not be quite clear because he had been in the United States long time, since a long time ago.37\n[68] The AA further testified that \"[a]fter I came out of the local police station, I went to my friend, [PC]. I asked him what was going on?\"38 [emphasis added] When the RPD asked about this inconsistency, the AA stated that he made a phone call to PC. When questioned by the Appellants' Counsel, the AA confirmed that PC was in the United States and that he went to the house church for the first time with CY. The AA also testified that, when he left the police station, he contacted PC via WeChat.39\n[69] In my view, the AA's original BOC narrative clearly indicates that his friend, PC, came to visit him to talk about Christianity and that PC later took the AA to the house church that he belonged to. I note there is only reference to one friend, PC, and no indication that another friend was involved. Similarly, the AA's amended narrative does not state that, although he was introduced to Christianity by PC, he attended the house church with a different friend; indeed, there is no mention of another friend, CY, being involved. The RPD did not err by interpreting these statements in a restrictive manner.\n[70] I find that the inconsistencies are not reasonably explained. I note that the AA did not testify that he had not intended to state in his BOC narrative that PC took him to the church. The AA also did not testify that the inconsistencies arise from translation; nor did the Appellants' Counsel make any submissions as to concerns with translation. The AA's explanation for the inconsistency in his original BOC narrative about whom he attended the house church with the first time is that he did not have a clear mind at the time. With respect to his testimony that he went to PC after he left the police station and, when confronted with the inconsistency, then testified that he had called PC via WeChat, the AA did not provide an explanation. The RPD did not err in drawing negative credibility inferences based on these inconsistencies, which are central to the AA's claim.\nInconsistencies in the Associate Appellant's evidence about whether he was detained by police are not reasonably explained\n[71] The RPD found that the AA omitted that he was detained by police in his original BOC narrative, without a reasonable explanation. Based on the omission and the inconsistencies between his POE interviews and his BOC form and BOC narratives, the RPD found that, on a balance of probabilities, the AA was not detained by police in XXXX 2019 and drew a negative inference as to the AA's attendance at a house church. The Appellants argue that the AA did mention that he was questioned by police in his POE interview and that the AA has never stated that he was arrested or detained; he was simply cooperating with the police. I disagree.\n[72] In his POE interview on XXXX XXXX, 2019, the AA stated that the police were going to arrest him because he attended an illegal Christian meeting.40 In his XXXX XXXX, 2019 POE interview, the AA stated that he could be arrested for attending a family church but indicated that he was never arrested.41 In his original BOC narrative, the AA does not mention any interaction with the police; he left China because he wanted to.42 On his Schedule \"A\" form, the AA answered no to the question asking whether he had ever been detained, incarcerated or put in jail.43 In his amended BOC narrative, the AA states:\nOn XXXX XXXX, 2019, 2 uniformed policemen came to my home in the morning and told me I had to come with them to the police station. I was questioned for 12 hours. They told me that they were investigating the house church I attended and they expected me to cooperate with them and provide any information that they required. I told them that I was new and I knew nothing about the workings of the church or the people who had organized the services. Eventually I was released after the questioning but they told me that I might be called to report again if they needed to hear from me.44\nHe states that his fear that the police would come looking for him again is what made him decide to leave China and seek refugee protection.\n[73] At the hearing, the AA testified that two police came to his home, and they took him to the police station and questioned him for twelve hours, and then he was released.45 When the RPD asked him why he made no mention of being questioned by police in his original BOC narrative, the AA stated, \"I could remember that when I was at the airport, I told the officers that I was questioned by the police for 12 hours.\" When asked again why he did not include that in his BOC narrative, the AA stated, \"I must have forgotten at the time.\"46 The RPD then reviewed the inconsistencies in the AA's POE interviews and his Schedule \"A\" form and asked the AA to explain them. The AA stated:\nBecause I learned, if I told the officers that I had been arrested, it won't do, it won't benefit my, my application and on the other hand, I just came out of the country and I didn't know anything.47\n[74] In response to questions from the Appellants' Counsel, the AA testified that the police did not tell him he was under arrest or being charged with any crime, that he was not put in handcuffs or held in a prison cell. The AA further testified:\nMr. XXXX: ...I was put in the room, just a room for questioning. It's for interrogation.\nCounsel: And, you said they questioned you for 12 hours. That, that seems like a very long time. What do, what was happening during those 12 hours?\nMr. XXXX: What I, what I said is that after they asked me some questions, I was put in that room and I was incarceration there for 12 hours.\nCounsel: But, what did, while, while you were, what was, what were you doing during that time?\nMr. XXXX: I was shut, I was shut indoors, sitting there. I was not allowed to go out.48 [emphasis added]\n[75] In my view, and contrary to the Appellants' submissions, the AA's description does indicate that he was detained at the police station for questioning for twelve hours. I find that the AA's explanation that he had forgotten to mention that he was held by police for questioning in his original BOC narrative is not reasonable. It is difficult to understand how the AA could forget being held by police for twelve hours, which had occurred only several months earlier, and is the reason he states that he left China. In addition, the AA had the assistance of Counsel in completing his BOC narrative and his Schedule \"A\" form. I also do not find the AA's explanation, that he had been told that telling Canadian authorities that he had been arrested would not benefit his claim, to be reasonable. At the XXXX XXXX, 2019 POE interview, the AA said that he feared persecution in China because the police are going to arrest him. The AA's statements are contrary to his explanation, as he did disclose that the police were going to arrest him. I find no error in the RPD's conclusion that the AA did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he was detained by the police because he attended an illegal house church. I also concur in drawing additional negative credibility inferences as to the AA's alleged practice of Christianity in China as the inconsistencies and omissions are central to the AA's claim.\nDocumentation\n[76] I do not agree with the Appellants' argument that the RPD fixated on perceived discrepancies in the AA's evidence and overlooked the letters from PC and CY. As noted above, I have found that the inconsistencies and omissions in the AA's evidence about his introduction to Christianity, whether he was detained and his actions after being released from detention are material elements of his claim and not reasonably explained. The letters from PC and CY are inconsistent with the AA's original BOC narrative and not reasonably explained. As such, I concur with the RPD in finding that the letters are not reliable, and I afford them no weight.\nThe Associate Appellant is not a genuine Christian\n[77] I acknowledge the AA's knowledge of Christianity, that he was baptised in XXXX 2019, and that he has regularly attended church services in person or online since XXXX 2021.49 Contrary to the Appellants' argument, I find that the RPD did not err in concluding that, on a balance of probabilities, the AA is not a genuine Christian.\n[78] The RPD correctly considered the finding that the AA did not, on a balance of probabilities, practise Christianity in China and was not pursued by the police for having attended an illegal house church. I agree with the RPD that the AA's Christian practice is tied exclusively to his alleged attendance at an illegal house church in China, which he began because he was very sad that his girlfriend broke up with him. The AA's evidence was that being detained by the police for attending the house church and practising Christianity was the reason he left China.\n[79] As such, my findings that the AA was not credible about these allegations raises significant doubt about the genuineness of his practice of Christianity in Canada. When I weigh these findings, along with the lack of corroborative evidence, I find that the AA's knowledge of Christianity, and the photographs and the letters attesting to his practice are insufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant is a genuine Christian. Recent caselaw confirms that this analysis is reasonable. In Wu, the applicant argued that the finding that he was not a practising Christian in China was not relevant to whether he was a genuine practitioner in Canada. The Federal Court did not find this argument compelling:\n[15] Mr. XXXX relies on two judgments of this Court in support of the argument that his lack of participation in a Christian church in China is irrelevant to his sur place claim: Chen v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 749 at para 58; Huang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 205 at para 32. In those cases, the Court states that the fact a refugee claimant was not a genuine practitioner of a particular religion in their country of origin does not mean the claimant has not become a practitioner since arriving in Canada.\n[16] In my opinion, there is no inconsistency between the RAD's analysis and the Court's analysis in the two cases. The RAD did not determine Mr. XXXX's sur place claim on the basis that he did not practice Christianity in China. Rather, the panel found that his explanation of the development of his interest in the religion was not credible. The RAD's analysis is similar to that of another RAD panel that was before me for review in Han v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 858 (Han). Ms. XXXX had stated that her Christian practice in Canada was a continuation of her involvement in China (Han at para 43):\n[43] In my view, the RAD's two-step analysis was transparent and intelligible. The Applicant positioned her sur place claim as a continuation of her Christian practices in China. Once that aspect of her claim was found to be fraudulent, the primary basis of her sur place claim fell away. Nevertheless, the RAD considered whether she had genuinely adopted and practiced her Christian faith while in Canada but concluded she had not.\n[17] The RAD undertook the same two-step analysis of Mr. XXXX's sur place claim. As a result, I find no reviewable error in the RAD's reliance on the negative credibility findings that undermine Mr. XXXX's description of the source of his Christian beliefs as one element in its assessment of the sur place claim.50\n[80] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the AA is not a genuine Christian.\nSur place claim\n[81] I disagree with the Appellants' argument that the RPD incorrectly stated that objective evidence indicates that Christians are not monitored by Chinese authorities and that the RPD improperly applied the test for a sur place claim.\n[82] The RPD noted that, while there is objective evidence that it is possible that Chinese authorities monitor dissidents and members of groups that it considers are cults in Canada, the evidence does not demonstrate that Chinese authorities monitor ordinary Christians in Canada who do not oppose the government. The RPD then correctly concluded that there is no evidence indicating that the religious activities of the Appellants in Canada have or would be likely to come to the attention of the Chinese government. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants' religious activities in Canada do not expose them to a forward-facing serious possibility of persecution upon return to China.\nAdditional RPD findings and the Appellants' submissions\n[83] Given that my findings discussed above are determinative, I find it unnecessary to review the remaining findings of the RPD and the Appellants' submissions. I do note that I agree with the Appellants that the RPD's reasoning with respect to their use of fraudulent documents to travel to Canada and the availability of fraudulent documents is faulty. I also agree that the RPD used faulty reasoning in finding it was not plausible that the PA would have no plan for her third pregnancy and in finding that it was not plausible that the AA would use a smuggler to leave China when, at the time, he had no fear of persecution. These errors in faulty reasoning relate to peripheral findings made by the RPD and do not have a determinative impact in this appeal.\nCONCLUSION\n[84] I find that the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution, nor do they, on a balance of probabilities, face a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to China.\n[85] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nKaren McGovern\nKaren McGovern\nApril 5, 2023\nDate\n1 Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), Guideline issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), effective July 18, 2022.\n2 IRPA, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, subsection 110(4).\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

She is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated September 26, 2022, rejecting her claim for refugee protection.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The determinative issue is the absence of a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[3] The Appellant presented no new evidence, so I could not hold an oral hearing.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The Appellant is a Roman Catholic. After her mother passed away in 2017, she was introduced to the faith by her aunt. The Appellant began to pray at home with her aunt and in XXXX 2018 also began to accompany her weekly to a house church. The Appellant alleges that in XXXX 2019 two members of the house church were arrested. Her aunt went into hiding and advised the Appellant that it was best for her to leave Vietnam. The Appellant and her uncle engaged a smuggler, who secured a work visa for her to come to Canada. The Appellant travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2020 and made her claim for refugee protection on July 28, 2020. She fears returning to Vietnam as she believes that she cannot practice her faith freely and will be arrested and jailed.\nANALYSIS\n[5] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1\n[6] The RPD accepted that the Appellant established that she is a practicing Roman Catholic. I have reviewed the record and the RPD reasons and I agree with them; the Appellant credibly established that she is a Roman Catholic.\n[7] The RPD also determined that the Appellant's house church was not demolished as she alleged and that the police are neither aware that she is a Catholic, nor are they searching for her for any reason. Regarding whether her fear is well-founded, the RPD found that Catholics of registered churches worship freely and that the Appellant would not be at risk because she previously practiced in an unregistered house church.\n[8] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of her objective risk as a Catholic. She argues that she cannot practice freely in a registered church as they do not \"place God first\" and that those who practice in unregistered house churches are at risk of persecution.\nThe Appellant can practice freely in a registered church\n[9] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding that she could practice freely in a registered church. I agree with the RPD that the objective evidence indicates that Catholics attending registered churches are able to worship freely.\n[10] The Appellant testified that her group leader told her that if their church was registered then it would be under the control of the government and that those churches do not really believe in God, whereas her church loves God more than anything else.2 While the Appellant's testimony benefits from the presumption of truthfulness, this does not apply to inferences and speculation. There is nothing in the objective evidence that suggests that registered churches do not believe in God or that there are limitations imposed by the government; on the contrary, the evidence is that they can freely practice their faith.3\n[11] The Appellant also testified that her aunt told her that when she attended a registered church the Communist Party was put ahead of God. The Appellant provided two letters from her aunt; the second letter4 was to corroborate her belief that registered churches do not practice freely. The aunt states that she used to attend mass in a cathedral, but that since 2015 the government has cracked down on churches. This includes the requirement to sing the national anthem prior to mass. She also states that the registered churches do not worship the true God. I agree with the RPD assessment; no information about when or which registered church she attended is provided, there is little context provided, and the evidence could not be tested as the aunt was not called as a witness. It is not clear if the aunt's experience was recent or tens of years ago; she wrote that she has been a Catholic for decades. The objective evidence states that 50 new Catholic parishes were registered in 2020.5 If registered churches did not worship the true God, or if they practiced Catholicism differently than in unregistered churches, I would expect that this would be mentioned in the objective evidence. There is nothing in the objective evidence to suggest they do. I afford the letter little weight in establishing that the Appellant's practice will be restricted in a registered church.\n[12] The Appellant was represented at the hearing and for this appeal and had the opportunity to provide evidence to support her position regarding the manner in which registered churches practice but did not do so. A review of the objective evidence simply does not support there being any distinction in the way the faith is practiced between registered and unregistered churches. The evidence indicates that Catholics in cities worship freely in churches.6 There is no mention of limitations on faith practices. The RPD did not err.\nThe Appellant can also practice her faith freely in an unregistered church\n[13] Even if I have erred with regard to the Appellant practicing in a registered church, I find that in the alternative she can also practice her faith freely in an unregistered church.\n[14] The Constitution of Vietnam guarantees freedom of religion and belief.7 The Vietnamese Government recognizes 39 religious organizations and one quarter of the population, about 24 million Vietnamese, are religious. Of those, 7% identify as Catholic.8 Vietnam has over 25,000 places of worship in the country and about 9,000 religious festivals per year.9\n[15] Catholicism is one of the religions recognized in Vietnam. The objective evidence shows that, generally, members of officially recognized religions can practice their religion freely for the most part. In general, Catholics are able to worship freely and receive sacraments such as the Eucharist, Reconciliation, and Confirmation.10\n[16] The objective evidence also indicates that the treatment of religious groups and individuals will vary depending on whether they are recognized or registered or not, the area they are based in, local issues, ethnicity, and the perceived level of threat they represent. Catholic movements that are political can draw negative attention from the authorities and there exists a history of land disputes between Catholics and the government that continues today.11 It is those that are perceived to challenge the authority or interests of the Communist Party through political activism that face a moderate risk of official discrimination from the authorities, including arrest.12\n[17] The Appellant argues that there is no evidence cited by the RPD that unregistered house church participants are not targeted solely for not being registered. This is akin to asking the RPD to prove a negative. She submits that there is ample evidence that unregistered Catholic churches experience persecution even without engaging in political activities or other activism, citing National Documentation Package (NDP) item 1.5 in support. I do not agree; that evidence states that it is members of unregistered religious organizations that get involved in local political issues or advocate for democracy who have been subject to harassment, arrest, and detention, and that cases have mainly been in areas with large ethnic minorities.13 The Appellant testified that she has not engaged in such activities.14\n[18] The Appellant also cites NDP item 12.1 to support her submission that the government targeted religious groups because they did not register. The report states some religious leaders of unregistered groups reported police harassment and detention; however, it also states that many religious leaders also reported improving conditions, with better relations between unregistered groups and local authorities, and members of recognized groups saying that they were generally able to practice their beliefs with less government interference.15 Further, the harassment was, in most cases, connected to groups whose members were involved in human rights advocacy activities. The report also states that ethnic-majority Kinh adherents largely reported the ability to practice without significant restrictions as long as they acted transparently to official oversight and, importantly, that this was equally true for both registered and unregistered religious groups.16 The appellant provided in her Basis of Claim (BOC) that she is of Kinh ethnicity. The Appellant resides in Ho Chi Minh, the largest city in Vietnam, with a population approaching 10 million.17 The objective evidence states that large cities tend to be more open in allowing religious observance without official interference.18 I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the appellant can practice her faith freely in an unregistered church.\nThe authorities are not seeking the Appellant\n[19] The RPD determined that the Appellant did not credibly establish that the police are searching for her.\n[20] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred and that she did provide a reasonable and plausible explanation, that the church members are a family, and that the government would be looking for her after the members were arrested.\n[21] The record shows that the Appellant is not aware that the police have ever searched for her or asked about her to anyone.19 She had no problems with the police prior to her leaving Vietnam, even after the two members of the church were arrested.20 When asked why she believed that the police are currently searching for her, the Appellant provided that she believed that since her aunt was of interest to the police she too might be arrested.21 When the RPD asked the Appellant how the police might even be aware that she was part of an unregistered church, she testified that since other members were arrested they must know and also that since she was a member and they are a family, the government would surely look for her.\n[22] I do not agree with the Appellant that since the RPD did not make any adverse credibility findings concerning the members being arrested or consider credibility to be a determinative issue in her case that her testimony in this regard benefits from the presumption of truth. The presumption does not apply to inferences and speculation. The police have never searched for the Appellant, have never been to her home, and have not issued a warrant or summons for her. The Appellant is speculating that she is being sought by the Vietnamese authorities. Even during the time that her aunt went into hiding the police did not seek her. There is no credible evidence in the record that corroborates the Appellant's claim that she would be arrested if she returned to Vietnam for participation in unsanctioned religious activities, as she submits.\n[23] The first letter22 from the Appellant's aunt corroborates the Appellant's introduction to Catholicism and the house church. It also advises of the arrest of two members in XXXX 2019, and that other members went into hiding. While the letter assists in establishing the Appellant's religious identity, I afford it little weight in establishing her allegation that she risks being arrested and jailed if she returned to Vietnam. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant is not wanted by the Vietnamese police.\n[24] The RPD also determined that the Appellant's house church was not demolished as she testified and that the members of her house church were not politically active. The Appellant has not contested these findings. I have reviewed the RPD reasons and I agree with them.\n[25] I find that there is not a serious possibility that the Appellant would be persecuted if she returned to Vietnam, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). I also find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Vietnam, pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nRon Stratigopoulos\nRon Stratigopoulos\n15 March 2023\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He fears persecution or harm if he returns to Vietnam based on his religious identity as a Christian. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellant's claim because they determined that he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[2] The Appellant is appealing the RPD decision. He argues that the RPD erred in its analysis of his well-founded fear of persecution.\n[3] No new evidence has been submitted in this appeal. An oral hearing is not requested. The determinative issue in this appeal is whether the RPD erred in their analysis of the Appellant's well-founded fear of persecution.\nDECISION\n[4] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS\n[5] The Appellant and his wife separated in 2016. He was very stressed and sad when his wife left. In XXXX 2017, his cousin spoke to him about Christianity and God's love. In XXXX 2017, the Appellant started attending his cousin's house church and he found that it cheered him up.\n[6] In XXXX 2019, two members of the Appellant's house church were arrested by the local police and the house church suspended all services. The Appellant decided to leave Vietnam so that he could practice his religion freely. He hired an agent to obtain his Canadian visa.\n[7] The Appellant came to Canada in XXXX 2020 and applied for refugee protection in July 2020.\nANALYSIS\n[8] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1 I have conducted my own assessment of the evidence. This included listening to the recording of the RPD hearing and reviewing all the documents submitted.\nWell-founded fear of persecution analysis\n[9] The RPD found the Appellant to be a credible witness, but they did not make an explicit finding about the genuineness of the Appellant's religious identity. The RPD determined that there is no objective basis for the Appellant's fear of persecution.\n[10] The Appellant engaged in religious activity in Canada, which created a sur place aspect to his claim. His testimony and corroborating documents, including his Baptism certificate,2 a letter from a church in Toronto,3 and photographs of him attending religious events4 establish his baptism and attendance at church. For the purpose of my analysis, I accept that the Appellant is a genuine Christian.\n[11] The Appellant's religion is the basis for harm and the nexus to a Convention ground for refugee protection. Therefore, I must determine whether the Appellant may face a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution if he returns to Vietnam.\n[12] A person does not meet the definition of a Convention refugee if there is no well-founded fear of persecution. Determining that there is a well-founded fear of persecution involves both a subjective and an objective component. A person must have a fear of persecution if they return to their home country. This is the subjective component. However, there must also be an objective basis for their fear.\n[13] The existence of both a subjective fear of persecution and an objective basis for that fear are necessary to conclude that there is a well-founded fear of persecution and that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.5\n[14] I agree with the RPD that there is insufficient evidence of an objective basis for the Appellant's fear of persecution.\nOverview of religious freedom in Vietnam\n[15] The Constitution of Vietnam provides for the right to freedom of belief and religion. Yet, there is significant government regulation over religion in the interest of national security and social unity. Religious denominations and organizations are required to register with, and be recognized by, the government before conducting any religious activities or gatherings. The government recognizes multiple religious denominations and organizations, and Protestantism is the third largest, with about one million followers.6\n[16] Registered religious groups do not generally encounter difficulties with the authorities. However, ethnic minority groups in certain areas of Vietnam, such as the Central Highlands, experience a disproportionate level of harassment or persecution for the practice of their faith, even if they become registered. Also, unregistered religious groups and churches report harassment by the authorities, particularly of their religious leaders. There are also reports of land disputes between church leaders and the authorities.7\n[17] Government officials do discriminate against, arbitrarily detain, or physically abuse individuals from religious groups. However, the majority of the reports relate to individuals who were also engaged in political or human rights advocacy work, or who had ties to overseas organizations that were critical of the authorities. Due to the links between religion, politics, and ethnicity, human rights organizations stated that it was difficult to categorize the reported incidents of harassment as being based solely on religious identity.8\n[18] The International Religious Freedom Report for 2021 states that religious leaders across the country reported improved conditions compared with prior years, such as better relations between unregistered religious groups and local authorities, but they also reported incidents of harassment including police questioning and brief periods of detention. However, members of recognized and registered groups were generally able to practice their beliefs with less government interference.9\nThere is no well-founded fear of persecution\n[19] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by not following the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada in Chan10 when applying the objective part of the test for a well-founded fear of persecution. The Supreme Court stated that a claimant may be able to establish that their fear is objectively well-founded, even in the absence of corroborating documentary evidence, by providing testimony regarding similarly situated individuals.\n[20] I note that, although the Supreme Court in Chan stated that a claimant can provide testimony regarding similarly situated individuals, the Court also stated that the situation of each person must still be assessed on its own merits.\n[21] The Appellant argues that the two members of his house church who were arrested by the police are similarly situated individuals. The Appellant provided limited details about the arrest or the outcome. He has no firsthand knowledge of why the two members of his house church were arrested. He was not present. He heard that it was because they were spreading the Gospel, but he does not know how they did so, or what they said. He also does not know the outcome of their arrest, or where they are now.\n[22] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Vietnam reports that, in the majority of cases, Christians who were harassed or persecuted in Vietnam were also members of minority ethnic groups, or lived in rural areas, or were leaders of a church, or engaged in political activity that was critical of the government. There is insufficient evidence of the circumstances that led to the arrest of the two house church members, such as their ethnicity or whether they were engaging in activity that was critical of the authorities when they were spreading the Gospel. Therefore, I am unable to determine that the house church members are similarly situated people or rely on their arrest to conclude that the Appellant could be at risk if he returns to Vietnam. The Appellant's cousin was a member of the same house church and is a similarly situated person. He has remained in Vietnam, and he has not been arrested or experienced problems with the authorities.\n[23] The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred by failing to consider legislation that came into effect in 2018 (The Law on Belief and Religion) which controls religious activity by requiring registration of religious groups. He further argues that registration requirements are burdensome and complex. They are applied unevenly and inconsistently across the country and create an obstacle to practicing religion in Vietnam. It is unclear from the Appellant's argument how this law requiring registration of religious groups impacts his particular circumstances. The Federal Court has consistently found that country condition evidence alone is insufficient to support a claim for refugee protection. It is not sufficient to rely on country condition evidence without linking this information to the Appellant's personal circumstances.11\n[24] The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred in its analysis of the country conditions evidence. I disagree. The RPD acknowledged that the Vietnamese government restricts religious freedom, and that Christians can face mistreatment by the authorities. However, considering the Appellant's particular circumstances, they concluded that there is no well-founded fear of persecution.\n[25] The Appellant quotes from a document in the NDP for Vietnam to support his argument that there are marked differences in the treatment of registered versus unregistered churches. The quoted portion states:\nA key distinction is between registered and unregistered faith groups. After the Vietnam War and the establishment of the unified Socialist Republic, the state created official religious groups and, since then, further groups have become registered. Registered groups worship with limited or no Government interference; those that are not registered may be pressured by Government to join a registered group.12\n[26] However, the quoted portion has been taken out of context since it refers to unregistered religious groups, not unregistered churches, and Protestantism is a recognized group. The same document the Appellant quoted from states that Protestantism is broadly recognized by the Government and Protestants have a significant presence in the country.13\n[27] The Appellant relies on documentation in the NDP regarding the treatment of Christians in Vietnam to support his claim. However, it is insufficient for the Appellant to simply rely on objective country conditions evidence to establish that he is personally at risk of persecution as a Christian. He must provide sufficient evidence of his particular situation and circumstances. His experience and subjective evidence may then be supported by the general country conditions.14\n[28] As already mentioned above, country condition evidence alone is insufficient to support a claim for refugee protection.15 The Appellant cannot rely only on objective general country conditions evidence to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. He must also provide sufficient subjective evidence of his specific situation and circumstances to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. He must link his particular circumstances to the general country conditions. The Appellant has not done so.\n[29] The Appellant lived in a district in Ho Chi Minh City, which is the largest city in Vietnam. The extent of difficulty a person could experience in practicing their faith depends on the area they live. Those who live in large cities are less likely to experience any interference and can practice freely.16\n[30] The Appellant argues that the discrimination he would face in Vietnam amounts to persecution. There is insufficient evidence to support this argument. The Appellant did not provide evidence of any discrimination or persecution that he has personally faced due to his religion as a Christian. He stated that he and cousin spread the Gospel in Vietnam. He did not have problems doing so. He also testified that he was previously a Buddhist before he became a Christian and he did not report any problems practicing his faith, even though the Buddhist faith is also regulated by the government.\n[31] General country condition evidence in the NDP, and in the articles the Appellant presented at the RPD hearing,17 provide examples of harassment and persecution of Christians. However, the reports of persecution mainly relate to rural areas and minority ethnic groups, or religious leaders and pastors, particularly if they have been publicly critical of the authorities. This is not applicable to the Appellant's circumstances.\n[32] The NDP also contains reports of harassment of members of religious groups who were also engaged in political or human rights advocacy work, or who had ties to overseas organizations that were critical of the authorities.18 This is not applicable to the Appellant's circumstances.\n[33] The Appellant argues that it is not possible to separate politics and religion when the government regulates religious activity. While this may be true, this does not change the fact that the interplay between religion and politics in the country conditions evidence concerns harassment or persecution of Christians who were also involved in political or human rights advocacy, particularly if they were critical of the government. The Appellant has no such involvement.\n[34] I recognize that the concept of religious freedom is broad and includes the right to practice one's faith in the manner they choose. The Appellant argued that he cannot practice at a registered church because they operate differently than unregistered churches, since they are required to worship the state ahead of God. However, the Appellant did not provide any evidence to support his statement, and I did not find any in the NDP. The Appellant never attended a registered church in Vietnam, so he has no firsthand knowledge as to how they operate. Also, he stated that the unregistered church that he used to attend no longer exists. Therefore, he would have to find a new church if he returned to Vietnam, and he has not provided sufficient evidence as to why he could not attend a registered church in his city.\nThe sur place aspect of the claim\n[35] I have considered the risk to the Appellant if he returns to Vietnam based on his religious activity in Canada.\n[36] The Appellant attended church services in Canada. He was also baptized in Canada. There is no evidence that this activity has come or will come to the attention of the authorities in Vietnam. More importantly, there is no evidence that his activity in Canada will place him at risk if he returns to Vietnam. The Protestant faith is broadly recognized by the Vietnamese government and Protestants have a significant presence in the country.19 There is insufficient evidence that the Appellant's participation in Christian activities in Canada could put him at risk of a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to Vietnam.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] The Appellant has not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to Vietnam. Nor has he established that there is a likelihood, on a balance of probabilities, of a risk to his life, or of torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[38] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nKaren Wallace\nKaren Wallace\nMarch 2, 2023\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated October 13, 2022. The Appellants allege that they faced a risk to their lives at the hands of the Sinaloa cartel. The RPD found that the Appellants had a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in M\u00e9rida and rejected their claims.\n[2] For the reasons that follow, the appeal is allowed, and the matter is returned to a differently constituted panel of the RPD.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellants allege that the Principal Appellant moved people across the Mexico\/US border as a source of income. The Appellants allege that the Principal Appellant was intercepted by the Sinaloa cartel, who kidnapped and assaulted him. They allege that the cartel demanded to know who the Principal Appellant worked for, and when he was unable to provide that information, they decided to kill him. The Appellants allege that the Principal Appellant's mother was able to convince the man who was set to kill the Principal Appellant to spare his life since she knew him as a customer at her XXXX XXXX. The Appellants allege that they fear that the Sinaloa cartel would continue to target them.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[4] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.1\nANALYSIS\nAppellants' arguments\n[5] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in finding that they a had a viable IFA. They argue that the Sinaloa cartel has both the means and motivation to locate and harm them throughout Mexico. The Appellants also seek to admit new evidence, which they argue satisfies the requirements to be entered with their appeal.\nI cannot determine whether certain allegations are credible or whether the Appellants have a viable IFA without rehearing the evidence before the RPD.\n[6] The RPD states that it accepted that the Appellants' allegations were credible but does not state why it came to this conclusion. Furthermore, there are aspects of the Appellants' allegations that are not considered in its IFA analysis.\n[7] The RPD found that the determinative issue was whether the Appellants had a viable IFA in M\u00e9rida. In its first prong analysis, the RPD concluded that the Sinaloa cartel did not have the ongoing motivation to locate and harm the Appellants. However, the RPD erred in its analysis by failing to fully consider various allegations, including whether they were credible, which were directly relevant to the analysis of whether the cartel has an on-going motivation to locate the Appellants.\n[8] There are a number of issues that were not fully canvassed or assessed by the RPD. For example, the identity of the individual who recruited the Appellant to move people across the border, and whether they are associated to a cartel. Further the Appellants' narrative indicates that his sister-in-law died, and they were fearful \"With fear of meeting those people, but fortunately being there we realized that they had been killed or disappeared already for a time.\"2 There is no discussion of what this means, and whether the Appellants are suggesting that the people who targeted them had died, which of course would be relevant to whether they could safely relocate to the IFA.\n[9] Furthermore, there were unexplored inconsistencies about what happened to the Appellants after they moved, which is central to whether the cartel has the means and motivation to locate them in the IFA.\n[10] The Appellants alleged in their narrative that they received messages from unknown callers in 20193 after moving to Guanajuato. However, at the hearing, the Principal Appellant testified that he knew that the messages he received were from the cartel because \"they said so\"4 which is inconsistent with their narratives. Also, at their hearing the Principal Appellant testified that after moving to Guanajuato, he was attacked by two armed thugs that he believed were associated with the cartel.5 This alleged attack is not mentioned in the Appellants' narratives, which raises questions about the credibility of this allegation.\n[11] I will also note that there are various inconsistencies in the Appellants' evidence, including variations between their testimony, narratives and support letters that were not fully canvassed. This includes how the Principal Appellant was able to call his sister when he was being held by the cartel, whether or not the military assisted his sister, and how his mother came to know of his kidnapping and secured his release.\n[12] I find that it was an error to fully consider these allegations in the first prong of the IFA analysis. However, as I set out, I cannot come to a determination on these issues without rehearing the evidence, assessing the credibility of these allegations and their relevance to whether the Appellants could safely relocate.\n[13] In considering the second prong analysis by the RPD, I find that RPD erred by failing to address a piece of the Appellants' supporting evidence, namely the \"report\" the Appellants submitted that seemingly suggests they have Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. This report is on plain paper, with no letterhead or indication of the author's credentials. The \"report\" is simple signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.6 On redetermination, the RPD should question the Appellants on this report and properly determine what impact, if any, this may have on the Appellants' ability to reasonably relocate.\n[14] Finally, I note that there seems to not have been any consideration of whether the Principal Appellant's actions of helping migrants enter the United States was legal or involved human smuggling. This is of course a significant issue, as it could potentially lead to issues of exclusion being raised. This needs to be canvassed on the redetermination of the Appellants' claims.\n[15] I will not make a determination on the admissibility of the Appellants new evidence, as they can submit it to the RPD for consideration on the redetermination of their claims.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined by a differently constituted panel.\nDIRECTIONS TO THE RPD\n[17] The previous record will be included in the redetermination of the Appellants' claims.\n[18] The RPD must canvass the issues highlighted in these reasons.\n(signed)\nJ.

He alleges he obtained Ugandan citizenship through fraud. He is a businessman who ran businesses in Eritrea, Uganda, and South Sudan. He fears the Eritrean government will detain or kill him if he returns to Eritrea. He also fears agents of the Eritrean state and persons cooperating with them will harm or kill him in Uganda or South Sudan. The Appellant's evidence discloses a long history living in Eritrea, Uganda, and South Sudan. Briefly, the Appellant alleges that in 2015, he was detained in Eritrea. After his escape from prison, he says the Eritrean government sought the assistance of the Ugandan government, Eritrean ex-patriates, and his family to make false allegations against him in Uganda, which resulted in criminal investigations and charges. Although he was not convicted, he fears he could be falsely accused again or face repercussions from the past allegations against him.\n[2] The Minister intervened at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on the issues of exclusion pursuant to Articles 1F(b) and 1E of the Refugee Convention, identity, credibility, and the well-foundedness of his claim. The Appellant's claim was initially joined with his minor daughter, adult son and granddaughter, and common-law spouse and two minor sons. The claims were eventually separated into four proceedings. The Appellant's claim was heard on its own over four hearings. The RPD found the Appellant was not credible and was excluded from protection because there are serious reasons for considering he committed serious non-political crimes outside the country of refuge. The crimes were trafficking in persons, sexual assault, and assault causing bodily harm or with a weapon.\n[3] The Appellant appeals the RPD's decision. He does not submit new evidence and does not request an oral hearing. As I did not admit new evidence, the requirements to hold an oral hearing in subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1 are not met.\n[4] The Minister has not intervened on appeal.\n[5] I dismiss the Appellant's appeal. The RPD made mistakes in parts of its assessment finding the Appellant excluded from protection. However, after considering the submissions, the entire record including the audio recordings, and conducting an independent assessment, I find there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed a serious non-political crime, trafficking in persons, outside the country of refuge. A finding that there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed a single serious non-political crime is sufficient to exclude the Appellant. I have therefore not considered whether he is also excluded for the crimes of sexual assault or assault causing bodily harm or with a weapon.\n[6] I find the Appellant is excluded from protection pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention and section 98 of the IRPA. I confirm the RPD's determination that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[7] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2\n[8] I have applied the correctness standard because I find the RPD did not have a meaningful advantage in assessing the Appellant's claim. All of the RPD's findings were made on the basis of a record that is before me for independent scrutiny. Specifically, the RPD's findings were based on the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) form and amendment, disclosed documents, the Minister's disclosed documents, the content of the Appellant's answers during the hearing, and the submissions. I have reviewed the Appellant's BOC form and amendment, the disclosed documents, submissions, and the audio recording and transcript of the RPD proceeding. I am therefore in the same position as the RPD to assess the Appellant's claim, with the additional benefit of submissions made on appeal.\nANALYSIS - APPELLANT IS EXCLUDED FROM PROTECTION\n[9] For the following reasons, I find the Appellant is excluded from protection because there are serious reasons for considering he committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge.\n[10] Specifically, I find there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the crime of trafficking in persons in Uganda (section 279.01 of the Criminal Code). I find this crime is serious for the purposes of exclusion. The crime is non-political.\n1. Overview of Article 1F(b) exclusion\n[11] Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention states its provisions shall not apply to a person if there are serious reasons for considering the person has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge.3 This article is directly incorporated into the IRPA in section 98, which states a \"person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\"4\n[12] Exclusion decisions are based on the standard of proof of serious reasons for considering. This standard falls below the balance of probabilities standard, but above mere suspicion.5 It exists where there is an objective basis for the belief that is based on credible and compelling information.6 The Minister has the burden of establishing there are serious reasons for considering the person committed the crime alleged,7 although the tribunal is not bound by the Minister's position about whether its burden is met.8\n[13] The jurisprudence directs that where a maximum sentence of imprisonment of ten years or more could have been imposed if the crime were committed in Canada, the crime will generally be considered serious. However, this is not a rigid presumption and should not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner.9 Assessing whether the crime is serious requires consideration of: the facts and elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the crime, and the Canadian sentencing range.10\n[14] The crime must also be non-political. A crime is political where first, the person commits the crime as part of an uprising aimed at changing government or policy and second, there is a rational connection between the crime and the objective of the uprising.11\n2. Background allegations related to exclusion\n[15] In 2016, police in Uganda investigated the Appellant for several crimes. These included sexual abuse against his eight-year-old daughter, threatening violence, procuring defilement, and human trafficking. The Appellant says he was only ever charged with threatening violence.\n[16] The Appellant states the investigations and charges against him are persecution by the Eritrean government, which sought the assistance of the Ugandan government, Eritreans in Uganda, and members of his family. In particular, he alleges his former daughter-in-law, Y, accepted money and falsely accused him of trafficking her and other women. He says this is false and in fact, she cooperated with Eritrean authorities when she had an affair with HH, an Eritrean-Canadian citizen. HH was later convicted of eloping with Y. He also says the Eritrean government plotted with Eritreans in Uganda to accuse him of threatening violence and sexually abusing women.\n[17] He says the Eritrean government is persecuting him because he escaped from prison in XXXX 2015. The background to the Appellant's detention in Eritrea in 2015 is the following. In around 1997, the Appellant was imprisoned in Eritrea for a month after refusing to join the National Service, act as its spokesperson, or pay additional funds. He was released and escaped to Ethiopia. Shortly after, he relocated to Uganda. The Appellant began operating businesses in Uganda and South Sudan. These businesses were profitable and the Appellant became known as a successful businessman.\n[18] In 2010, Eritrean government officials met with the Appellant. They encouraged him to invest in business in Eritrea, promising political improvements. The Appellant accepted and states he invested approximately US$XXXX XXXX into businesses and infrastructure in Eritrea. However, the Appellant was not satisfied with the political situation in Eritrea. He criticized the then-President of Eritrea during a meeting in Uganda in 2011. After the meeting, he met with the President privately and expressed further concerns about the rule of law and human rights in Eritrea. Two years later, a presidential advisor expressed upset at his actions from 2011. The advisor told the Appellant to leave Eritrea. The Appellant says he was scared, but because of the significant money he had invested, he returned to Eritrea secretly in 2015.\n[19] The Appellant was detained in XXXX 2015. He was able to escape with the help of a guard and doctor. He remained in hiding for several months before flying from Eritrea to Uganda in XXXX 2015. After he returned to Uganda, he says the persecution by the Eritrean government began, as described above.\n[20] The Appellant continued to operate his businesses in Uganda and South Sudan. However, he made plans to leave Uganda. He says he paid money to obtain Ugandan citizenship and passports for himself and his family members. While planning to leave Uganda, he says he was attacked by gunmen in XXXX 2017. In XXXX 2017, he was arrested in connection to the disappearance of another Eritrean businessman, but was released after 10 days. In XXXX 2017, he travelled to the United States of America (USA) with his family. He helped them get to the Canadian border to make claims at an irregular port of entry. He returned to Uganda from the USA and then came to Canada in XXXX 2018.\n3. Serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed a crime\n[21] I find there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the crime of trafficking in persons. This crime was committed in Uganda, so happened outside the country of refuge.\n[22] When referring to the Canadian crime and its elements, I use the term trafficking in persons because this reflects the language in the Canadian Criminal Code. The Ugandan documents use the term human trafficking, so when referring to that evidence, I use the term human trafficking.\n[23] The Appellant submits the RPD was wrong to consider whether he is excluded for the crime of trafficking in persons where the Minister submitted they had not bet their burden. I disagree. The RPD is not bound to accept the position of a party in a case. Instead, it must carry out its statutory duty of apply the IRPA, which requires considering exclusion pursuant to section 98.12 I must also do the same.\n[24] Overall, I find there is credible and compelling evidence about the crime of trafficking in persons. In the circumstances of this appeal, the fact the Appellant's charge in Uganda was withdrawn is not determinative of whether there are serious reasons for considering he committed the crime. The Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the charge is fabricated. Finally, the credible evidence establishes there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the elements of the crime of trafficking in persons.\n3.1 Credible and compelling evidence regarding crime\n[25] There is credible and compelling evidence about the crime of trafficking in persons.\n[26] The Appellant submits the RPD's exclusion decision is based on its finding that the Appellant is not a credible witness. He submits the RPD therefore found his denials of the\nallegations not credible, such that there are serious reasons for considering he committed the crimes. The Appellant submits it was wrong for the RPD to fail to assess the allegations and give reasons for finding them credible to meet the standard of serious reasons for considering.13\n[27] Contrary to the Appellant's submissions, the RPD referenced evidence it relied on to find there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the crime of trafficking in persons. The RPD mentions news articles, online posts by alleged victims, a letter from the Eritrean Community in Uganda, a Ugandan police letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, and a letter from the Ugandan Department of Public Prosecutions Report dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020.14\n[28] However, I agree with the Appellant that the RPD did not specifically assess the credibility of this evidence. As the Appellant submits, findings of serious reasons for considering must be based on credible and compelling information.15 I will therefore assess the credibility of the evidence.\n[29] I find there are two pieces of evidence that set out the crime. The first is a letter from the Uganda Police Force, dated XXXX XXXX, 2016.16 The second is a letter from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), dated XXXX XXXX, 2020.17\n[30] The letter from the Uganda Police Force is a credible document. It was submitted by the Appellant and I have no reason to doubt its authenticity. It is written on letterhead, dated, and hand signed by a representative for the Director, Criminal Investigations. The letter is probative in that it confirms the Appellant is being investigated in several cases, including human trafficking. I give this document full weight towards establishing the Ugandan police investigated the Appellant for human trafficking.\n[31] The letter from the Office of the DPP is a credible document. It was also submitted by the Appellant and I have no reason to doubt its authenticity. It is written on letterhead, dated, and is signed by a representative for the DPP. I find the contents reliable because the letter sets out the source of its information about Y's allegations: a signed statement from Y that was submitted to Interpol Uganda. The letter is highly probative in that it sets out facts underlying the crime. It states:\na. In 2013, the Appellant lured Y from Eritrea to Uganda with the promise of education and a high quality of life. He also promised that Y would eventually marry the Appellant's son.\nb. After arriving in Uganda on XXXX XXXX, 2013, Y was forced to have sex with the Appellant's son and became pregnant. She gave birth in XXXX 2014.\nc. The Appellant sexually exploited Y in his house. Y disclosed her experiences to her sister and the Appellant's wife at the time. Y witnessed the Appellant sexually assault other girls, seven of whom she names.\nd. The Appellant's wife at the time escaped and sought refuge at the Eritrean Embassy in South Sudan.\ne. Y submitted a signed statement through Interpol Uganda. She has not returned further requests for information from Ugandan authorities.\nf. The referenced police case file matches one of the case numbers listed in the Uganda Police Force letter.\ng. The letter also contains a court file number: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.18\n[32] I give the letter from the Office of the DPP full weight towards establishing the Appellant was charged with human trafficking. The Federal Court of Appeal has confirmed that in the proper context, the RPD or Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) can rely upon an indictment or warrant (i.e. a formal criminal charge) to conclude there are serious reasons for considering a person has committed a serious crime outside Canada.19 I find the letter establishes there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant was charged with human trafficking in Uganda.\n[33] The letter from the Office of the DPP also provides details of the circumstances underlying the charge. However, because the charge was withdrawn and the Appellant alleges it was fabricated, I will assess the credibility of the evidence underlying the charge in the next sections of the decision.\n[34] The Appellant denied any criminal charges related to Y's allegations of human trafficking. When asked repeatedly if he was charged in relation to these allegations, he stated, \"No, it started on Facebook and ended on Facebook.\"20 The Appellant's testimony on this issue is not credible. According to documents he submitted, he was charged with human trafficking in Uganda in 2016.\n[35] The Appellant relies on the decision in Mohamad Jawad.21 In that decision, the person was charged with drug trafficking in Florida, but pled no contest to drug possession. The Federal Court found that the laying of a charge by police does not establish the crime charged was committed, as the RPD assumed in its decision. At the same time, the Federal Court also acknowledged - consistent with earlier decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal - that police reports may be credible and compelling evidence on which to base exclusion findings. However, the court elaborated that the issue in the decision before it was that the reports contained no information indicative of drug trafficking, such as prior convictions or the separation of drugs for sale. The decision in Mohamad Jawad is distinguishable from the evidence before me. Unlike Mohamad Jawad, the letter from the Office of the DPP contains underlying details specific to the alleged crime, the credibility of which I will assess in the next sections of the decision.\n[36] Unlike the RPD, I give no weight to the online posts by alleged victims. The online posts by the alleged victims are on a blog, which appears to have been shared on Facebook.22 Although the online posts claim to be statements from Y and other victims, there is no way to verify who wrote the statements or posted them online. For that reason, I find the online posts are not reliable and are not credible and compelling information on which I can base an exclusion decision.\n[37] I also give no weight to the letter from the Eritrean Community in Uganda.23 The letter is written to the Director of Public Prosecutions in XXXX 2016. It describes several crimes the organization believes the Appellant committed. It references several police complaint file numbers. However, the letter is not signed by anyone personally. It also does not explain how the organization is aware the Appellant committed any of the listed crimes. It is not clear whether the organization is basing the allegations on personal knowledge or is repeating information learned through other sources. For those reasons, I find the letter is not reliable and is not credible and compelling information on which I can base an exclusion decision.\n[38] In summary, there is credible and compelling evidence that the Appellant was charged with human trafficking in Uganda. There is also evidence about the circumstances underlying the charge. However, because the charge was withdrawn and the Appellant alleges it was fabricated, I will assess the credibility of the evidence underlying the charge in the next sections of the decision.\n3.2 Prosecution withdrawing charge not determinative\n[39] In the circumstances of this appeal, the fact the Appellant's human trafficking charge in Uganda was withdrawn is not determinative of whether there are serious reasons for considering he committed the crime.\n[40] The Appellant submits that in the jurisprudence where the courts found the existence of an indictment or warrant established serious reasons for considering the person committed a crime, the warrant was outstanding. He submits that in his situation, there are no outstanding charges or warrants for his arrest because the prosecution withdrew the charges.24 He also submits the RPD was wrong to rely on allegations on which the judicial system in Uganda chose not to proceed.25\n3.2.1 RAD can consider withdrawn charges\n[41] I am not persuaded by the Appellant's submissions that the RPD or RAD can only consider outstanding charges in assessing whether there are serious reasons for considering a person committed a crime.\n[42] The Appellant accurately points out that in Xie26 and Qazi,27 the warrants were outstanding. However, in my view, those decisions do not require the warrant be outstanding for it to be considered. Rather, they stand for the principle that in the proper context, the RPD or RAD can rely upon an indictment or warrant (i.e. a formal criminal charge) to conclude there are serious reasons for considering a person has committed a serious crime outside Canada. In Xie, the proper context was the existence of a warrant for embezzling money and unexplained wealth in a similar amount.28 In Qazi, it was the existence of a warrant and the absence of credible allegations that the charges were fabricated.29\n[43] Additionally, other Federal Court of Appeal and Federal Court jurisprudence explicitly states the tribunal can consider evidence surrounding withdrawn or dismissed charges, although it would be an error to rely solely on the withdrawn charge itself.30 In Sittampalam, the Federal Court of Appeal found no reviewable error where the tribunal relied on the circumstances underlying withdrawn charges.31 The courts have emphasized the distinction between the fact a person was charged with a crime and reliance on evidence that underlies such a charge.32\n[44] I am also not persuaded by the Appellant's submission that it is wrong to consider charges on which the judicial system in Uganda chose not to proceed.\n[45] The Appellant relies on the decision in Arevalo Pineda.33 In that decision, the person was charged with several offences in the United States. A court dismissed the charges after the alleged victim recanted her allegations and refused to testify at trial.34 The Federal Court found it was not wrong for the tribunal to consider the dismissed charges in assessing exclusion. It reasoned the tribunal is applying a much lower standard of proof than a criminal trial and that \"charges can be dismissed for a variety of reasons including procedural issues, rejection of crucial evidence for technical reasons, or simply because the accused raised a reasonable doubt.\"35\n[46] However, the Federal Court overturned the decision because the tribunal failed to properly consider how the court's dismissal of the charges affected the weight to be given to the evidence underlying the charges. The Federal Court stated a court's dismissal of charges may be strong evidence those crimes were not committed by the person, unless the dismissal is not conclusive.36 It gave examples of where a court dismissal would not be conclusive, such as where there is credible evidence of the commission of the crime (aside from the charge itself) or where the dismissal is based on reasons that do not bind the tribunal.37\n[47] More recently in Abbas,38 the Federal Court affirmed it was not wrong for the RPD to consider withdrawn and dismissed charges. Importantly, the Federal Court found the RPD did not rely solely on the charges, but also considered a supporting police report.39 Additionally, the Federal Court made a distinction between a dismissal of charges after a trial on the merits, compared to the situation in Abbas where there was no dismissal by a court of law.40 Other Federal Court decisions have also confirmed the tribunal can rely on withdrawn or dismissed charges, emphasizing there must simply be serious reasons for considering the crime was committed.41\n3.2.2 Withdrawal of charge not determinative in these circumstances\n[48] When I apply these considerations to the Appellant's situation, I find the prosecution's withdrawal of the charge is not determinative of whether there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the crime.\n[49] It is important that no court of law dismissed the human trafficking charge in Uganda. It was a decision by the prosecution. I find the prosecution's decision to not pursue the charge is less probative to whether the Appellant committed the crime than if a court had dismissed the charge after a trial on the merits. Additionally, I have considered the reasons given by the prosecution for not pursing the charge. I find the reasons are based on considerations that do not bind me in assessing exclusion and do not undermine the credibility of the evidence underlying the charge.\n[50] The letter from the Office of the DPP, dated XXXX XXXX, 2020, gives details for why the prosecution found the case was not tenable.42 One of the prosecution's concerns is the lack of continued contact with Y or an indication that she is currently interested in pursuing the case. This may be relevant when the prosecution is deciding whether to proceed with a criminal prosecution. An exclusion decision is not a criminal trial and I am not tasked with determining the Appellant's guilt. Additionally, I find the concern relies on the incorrect assumption that survivors of gender-based violence will behave in a particular manner, such as pursuing a criminal complaint.43 I find the lack of continued contact with Y or information about whether she wants to pursue the case is not binding on me in assessing exclusion. The concern does not undermine the credibility of the evidence underlying the charge.\n[51] Another concern is the lack of physical examination of Y. I find this concern is not binding on me in assessing exclusion. The charge is based on historical events. Evidence obtained through a physical examination years later may not be useful in assessing whether Y was trafficked or exploited. This concern does not undermine the credibility of the evidence underlying the charge.\n[52] A further concern is the absence of evidence obtained through legal means. The admissibility of evidence in this proceeding is different than in a criminal prosecution. This concern is therefore not binding on me in assessing exclusion. It does not undermine the credibility of the evidence underlying the charge.\n[53] Finally, the prosecution states a concern that Y made up allegations of child sexual exploitation and physical abuse against the Appellant to seek asylum in a Schengen country. The basis for this concern is not explained. It may be referencing the Appellant's contention these allegations and the charge are persecution against him by the Eritrean state, which will be assessed in detail below. Given the unexplained reasons for this concern, I find it is not binding on me in assessing exclusion. It does not undermine credibility of the evidence underlying the charge.\n[54] In summary, for all these above reasons, I find I can appropriately consider the withdrawn charge. Further, the reasons the charge was withdrawn are based on considerations that do not bind me in assessing exclusion and do not undermine the credibility of the evidence underlying the charge. The fact the charge was withdrawn is not determinative of whether there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the crime.\n3.3 Allegation charge is fabricated is not credible\n[55] The Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the human trafficking charge is fabricated.\n[56] The Appellant submits he does not bear the burden of proving his innocence and the RPD improperly reversed the onus.44 He submits the charges against him, including the human trafficking charge, are fabricated and are examples of the Eritrean government's persecution against him for political reasons.45 Specifically, he submits to Eritrean government has \"sought the cooperation and assistance of the Ugandan government, of Eritrean ex-patriates in Uganda, and members of the appellant's family, including his common-law spouse who refused to cooperate, and his daughter-in-law who accepted the bribery led the attack against him.\"46 The Appellant submits the RPD was wrong to find it implausible he was subject to a conspiracy by the Eritrean government, as country evidence sets out the state monitors and persecutes critics and perceived critics.47 He also references some of his documents supporting this contention.48 He submits the RPD's negative credibility findings have no relevance to the issue of exclusion.49 Finally, the Appellant submits the RPD was wrong to ignore that he that disclosed most of the evidence of charges against him. He submits this should weigh positively in assessing his credibility.50\n3.3.1 RPD did not require Appellant provide his innocence or reverse onus\n[57] I am not persuaded by the Appellant's submission that the RPD required he prove his innocence or reversed the onus.\n[58] Where the Minister intervenes at the RPD alleging a claimant is excluded, it is open to the claimant to present evidence against the allegation. Considering whether the claimant has provided credible evidence supporting their position does not amount to requiring he prove his innocence or reverse the onus. It is part of what the RPD is required to do to assess whether there are serious reasons for considering the claimant is excluded.\n[59] Although I explain my reasons differently, I find the RPD properly followed the Federal Court's direction in Qazi.51 The Appellant alleges charges are fabricated, which means the RPD and RAD must assess whether the Appellant is credible in his allegation that the charges are fabricated.\n3.3.2 RPD did not make plausibility finding about alleged conspiracy by Eritrean government\n[60] I disagree with the Appellant's submission that the RPD found it implausible the Eritrean government would persecute him in the ways he described. The RPD did not find such an allegation is implausible. Instead, it found the Appellant did not credibly establish the charges and allegations against him were part of a conspiracy against him by the Eritrean government with the help of the Ugandan government, Eritrean ex-patriates, and members of his family. The RPD was correct to assess whether such allegations are credible in the Appellant's situation.52\n3.3.3 Some negative credibility findings are relevant and undermine Appellant's credibility about fabrication of charge\n[61] I agree with the Appellant's submission and find some of the RPD's negative credibility findings are not relevant to assessing whether the charge is fabricated. However, I find some of the negative credibility findings are relevant and will explain why. These issues undermine the credibility of the Appellant's allegation the human trafficking charge is fabricated.\n[62] First, the Appellant's refusal to submit to criminal background checks in Eritrea, Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia - three countries he alleges are involved in his persecution - does not undermine his overall credibility. If Canadian authorities were to submit requests to these countries, it could alert those authorities of the Appellant's presence in Canada. If anything, the Appellant's refusal to submit to the criminal background checks is consistent with his fear of the Eritrean state and its alleged influence over other states. While his behaviour in refusing to agree to the criminal background checks is not corroborative evidence of the allegations of conspiracy, it does not undermine his overall credibility.\n[63] Second, I agree the issue of whether the Appellant is a citizen of Uganda and his credibility on this issue is not relevant to the issue of exclusion. I therefore find it is unnecessary for me to consider whether the Appellant is a citizen of Uganda to assess whether the Appellant has established the charge against him is fabricated.\n[64] Third, I find the Appellant's repeated reavailments to Uganda from 2015 to 2018 are also not relevant to the issue of exclusion. I therefore find it is unnecessary for me to consider the Appellant's reavailments to Uganda in assessing whether the Appellant has established the charge against him is fabricated.\n[65] However, I find the credibility issues about the Appellant's history of persecution are related to the credibility of his allegations the charge against him is fabricated. The RPD made two findings about the Appellant's history of persecution. The first relates to the Appellant's alleged arrest and escape from prison in Eritrea in 2015. The second relates to alleged threats from the Eritrean ambassadors to Uganda and South Sudan in 2016.\n[66] The Appellant has not directly challenged these two findings. The Appellant's Memorandum submits he disputes the RPD's finding that he was not a credible witness and will address it below.53 However, the Appellant's Memorandum does not contain any submissions about why the RPD was wrong in these two credibility findings. As the Federal Court has held, \"[t]he RAD is not required to provide reasons for unchallenged findings.\"54 I note, however, that I have conducted an independent assessment of the record and agree with the RPD's findings. Like the RPD, I find the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he escaped from Eritrean prison as alleged. Similarly, he has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that Eritrean ambassadors to Uganda and South Sudan threatened him in 2016.\n[67] Both of these credibility issues are related to whether the charge against the Appellant is fabricated. The first issue is relevant because the Appellant alleges the circumstances of his detention in Eritrea, including his escape from prison, are what caused the Eritrean government to persecute him. He alleges his escape caused the Eritrean government to collude with the Ugandan government, Eritrean ex-patriates in Uganda, and members of the Appellant's family to persecute him, including bringing fabricated charges against him. If the events about his escape are not credible, then it undermines the credibility of the events the escape allegedly triggered.\n[68] The alleged threats from the Eritrean ambassadors in Uganda and South Sudan are also relevant to whether the charge is fabricated. The Appellant alleges these threatening calls happened before his first arrest. If such threats are not established, they undermine his allegation that Eritrean authorities in several countries were involved in his persecution.\n3.3.4 Supporting documents do not establish charge is fabricated\n[69] I find the supporting documents do not establish the human trafficking charge is fabricated, on a balance of probabilities.\n[70] The Appellant submits his supporting documents demonstrate the charge against him is fabricated and part of the Eritrean government's persecution. He references an article from The Second Opinion, from September 2020, and an article from Red Pepper, dated October 6, 2020. He also relies on a letter from his Ugandan lawyer. He also references the fact the Canadian charge of uttering threats against HH (the same person who \"eloped\" with Y) was dropped. Finally, he submits the allegations of sexual assault against his eight-year-old daughter were proven to be false, which means the other charges are also fabricated.\n[71] The Appellant and Minister disclosed numerous news articles to the RPD. The news articles are from a variety of publications: Hello Daily, Vision papers (New Vision, Saturday Vision, Vision Group Archives), Red Pepper papers (Sunday Pepper, Red Pepper on Friday, Red Pepper on Sunday, Saturday Pepper, Red Pepper on Tuesday, Red Pepper), The Kampala Sun, Daily Monitor, The Second Opinion, EastAFRO.com, TesfaNews, Assenia.com, InFocus, The Observer, and an unknown paper.\n[72] I find the articles from Hello Daily, Red Pepper papers, The Kampala Sun, and The Second Opinion are not credible sources of information. I do not doubt these are genuine newspaper articles. However, I find their contents are not reliable reporting. These are tabloid style newspapers and their headlines and reporting are heavy on scandal and sensationalism, which undermines their accuracy and objectivity.55 For example, Hello Daily's motto is \"no one is innocent....\"56 In addition to the headline about the Appellant (\"NETTED - Eritrean Tycoon Arrested Over Rape, Human Trafficking\"), the Hello Daily article includes other headlines involving illuminati links, exposing sex chats with a \"side-dish\", and \"chain-bonking\" events.57 The Red Pepper, The Kampala Sun, and The Second Opinion papers contain similar sensationalized headlines, including \"7 ways women cheat, how to nail them\",58 \"sordid details\" of weddings,59 \"Why STDs Stay Longer In Women Than Men\",60 \"Celeb Death Match\",61 and lovers dumping politicians.62\n[73] In addition to the sensationalized headlines, I find the reporting in the articles from these papers is not reliable. The articles are replete with unsourced information and contradictory details. The articles also engage in circular citation patterns, in which articles repeat information from other news sources or the paper's earlier articles.63 For example, the Red Pepper on Sunday article, dated January 8, 2017, repeats its earlier reporting and relies on unnamed sources and insiders to explain how the Appellant is subject to a plot against him. It also reports the Appellant was in Eritrea on official business between XXXX and XXXX 2015, which is when he alleges he was in hiding after escaping from prison.64 The October 2020 Red Pepper article repeats much of the January 8, 2017 article, similarly relying on unnamed sources and insiders.65 Another example is The Second Opinion article, from September 2020, which relies on unnamed sources and information to substantiate that the Appellant is subject to a plot against him.66 The articles get some details correct, such as the Appellant being charged with crimes including human trafficking and those charges being withdrawn. However, overall, they are not reliable because the reporting is coloured by the unsourced information, contradictory details, and circular citation patterns.\n[74] I therefore place no weight on the articles from these papers that report or repeat allegations that the charge of human trafficking is fabricated, including The Second Opinion article from September 2020 and the Red Pepper article from October 6, 2020. For the same reasons, I also find these articles are not credible sources of information about the details of the human trafficking charge against the Appellant.\n[75] Additionally, the Minister disclosed an article from an unknown news source.67 I find it is not a reliable source of information as it repeats information from other news sources and makes factual statements without substantiating the source of information. For example, the article states the Appellant was detained in Eritrea in relation to the human trafficking, rape, and abuse charges, but does not name any source for this information. The article does not support the Appellant's allegation that the charge against him is fabricated.\n[76] I find the articles from Vision papers, Daily Monitor, EastAFRO.com, TesfaNews, Assenia.com, InFocus, and The Observer are credible sources of information.68 These newspapers present reliable reporting of events, including naming specific sources. However, none of the articles from these papers support the Appellant's allegation that the human trafficking charge is fabricated. While some of the articles report dismissed charges or that other persons were arrested in cases where the Appellant was previously investigated, this does not support the Appellant's allegation that the charges and investigations against him are fabricated.\n[77] The TesfaNews article reproduces the online post made by Y.69 For clarity, I am not relying on this newspaper article as credible evidence underlying the human trafficking charge. As\nexplained earlier in these reasons, I find the online blog post is not a credible source of information on which to base an exclusion decision. The paper's reproduction of the online post does not make it credible.\n[78] The Appellant relies on a letter from his Ugandan law firm addressed to his former refugee counsel, dated XXXX XXXX, 2018.70 There is also an earlier letter from the same Ugandan law firm, dated XXXX XXXX, 2018.71 Both of these letters state the Appellant faced fabricated criminal charges in Uganda. I give these documents minimal weight towards establishing the human trafficking charge is fabricated. Although they are genuine documents, I find they have low probative value. I agree with the RPD's assessment that the letters present the lawyer's opinion the charges against the Appellant are fabricated. Notably, neither letter specifies the human trafficking charge. Further, the letters do not explain on what evidence or observations the lawyer came to their opinion. The fact the Appellant's house was robbed by someone later accused of human trafficking does not establish the charges against the Appellant are fabricated. Similarly, the fact similar allegations in South Sudan were dropped - allegations which the Appellant has never disclosed - does not establish the charges in Uganda are fabricated. I find the lawyer's opinion does not tend to prove the charges are fabricated.\n[79] The Appellant also submits the Canadian charge of uttering threats against HH (the same person who \"eloped\" with Y) was dropped. Although HH has a past connection with Y, the dismissal of the Canadian charge does not mean Y fabricated the human trafficking allegations at the direction of the Eritrean government.\n[80] Additionally, I find the fact HH was convicted of eloping with Y does not mean the human trafficking charge is fabricated. First, elopement (a married woman absconding with an unmarried man)72 is not a crime in Canada. Women are free to leave their partner or house with whomever they want without criminal reprisal against that person. Further, the court judgment also notes Y left because the Appellant sexually assaulted her. The Ugandan court dismissed this defence because if the sexual assault were true, the court \"wonders\" why Y did not report the sexual assault or obtain a medical report.73 This reasoning relies on discredited myths and stereotypes.74 Overall, HH's conviction demonstrates he helped Y leave the Appellant's house, but does not mean Y fabricated charges against the Appellant at the influence of the Eritrean government.\n[81] The Appellant also submits the allegation he sexually assaulted his eight-year-old daughter is false, so this means the other charges are fabricated. He relies on a medical report requested by the Uganda Police.75 The report confirms his daughter denied having sexual intercourse with her father and confirms there were no obvious injuries to her body. While the report is probative towards refuting the accusation that he sexually assaulted his daughter, it does not mean the charge of human trafficking is fabricated. The letter from the Office of the DPP,76 which sets out the facts underlying the crime of human trafficking, is independent from the online blog that mentions the accusation involving the Appellant's daughter.\n[82] I have reviewed the other evidence in the record and find it does not support the Appellant's allegation that the charges in Uganda, including the human trafficking charge, are fabricated. There is a police report documenting an attack against the Appellant's house in Uganda, committed by Eritreans, in XXXX 2018.77 However, this attack does not mean the Eritrean government directed Eritrean ex-patriates in Uganda to attack the Appellant's house or that the human trafficking charge is fabricated.\n[83] There are also documents about the Appellant's brother's death in XXXX 2018.78 The Appellant testified the Eritrean ambassador refused to permit an investigation into his brother's death. The Appellant says this is how he knows his brother's murder is related to the Appellant's persecution by the Eritrean government.79 The brother's death is tragic. However, it does not mean the Eritrean government murdered the Appellant's brother or that the Eritrean government had a human trafficking charge fabricated against the Appellant in Uganda.\n[84] Finally, the fact the Appellant disclosed most of the evidence of the charges against him does not change my assessment of whether the human trafficking charge is fabricated. The Appellant disclosed documents to support his allegation the charges against him are fabricated. I have considered the credibility of these documents to assess whether they support his allegation and whether there are serious reasons for considering he committed a crime. The fact he was forthright in disclosing documents that do not support his allegation, and instead support a finding of exclusion, does not change my assessment.\n3.3.5 Summary\n[85] The Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the human trafficking charge is fabricated. The issues with the Appellant's testimony on his history of persecution are relevant and undermine the credibility of his allegation that the human trafficking charge is fabricated. The documents supporting his allegation the charge is fabricated are not credible sources of information. Other credible documents do not support his allegation the Eritrean government influenced others to make false criminal allegations against him.\n3.4 Serious reasons for considering Appellant committed elements of the crime\n[86] I find there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the elements of the offence of trafficking in persons.\n3.4.1 Relevant Criminal Code sections\n[87] I must assess the Appellant's acts against Canadian law at the time I am assessing exclusion.80 Section 279.01 of the Criminal Code81 states:\nTrafficking in persons\n279.01 (1) Every person who recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds, conceals or harbours a person, or exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person, for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation is guilty of an indictable offence and liable\n(a) to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of five years if they kidnap, commit an aggravated assault or aggravated sexual assault against, or cause death to, the victim during the commission of the offence; or\n(b) to imprisonment for a term of not more than 14 years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years in any other case.\nConsent\n(2) No consent to the activity that forms the subject-matter of a charge under subsection (1) is valid.\nPresumption\n(3) For the purposes of subsections (1) and 279.011(1), evidence that a person who is not exploited lives with or is habitually in the company of a person who is exploited is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the person exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of that person for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation.\n[88] Section 279.04 defines exploitation. That section states:\nExploitation\n279.04 (1) For the purposes of sections 279.01 to 279.03, a person exploits another person if they cause them to provide, or offer to provide, labour or a service by engaging in conduct that, in all the circumstances, could reasonably be expected to cause the other person to believe that their safety or the safety of a person known to them would be threatened if they failed to provide, or offer to provide, the labour or service.\nFactors\n(2) In determining whether an accused exploits another person under subsection (1), the Court may consider, among other factors, whether the accused\n(a) used or threatened to use force or another form of coercion;\n(b) used deception; or\n(c) abused a position of trust, power or authority.\n3.4.2 Serious reasons for considering Appellant committed elements of the crime\n[89] As explained above, there is credible evidence the Appellant was charged with the crime of trafficking in persons. In the circumstances of this appeal, the fact the charge in Uganda was withdrawn is not determinative of whether there are serious reasons for considering he committed the crime. The reasons the charge was withdrawn are based on considerations that do not bind me in assessing exclusion and do not undermine the credibility of the evidence underlying the charge. Additionally, the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the charge is fabricated. I therefore give full weight to the evidence underlying the charge set out in the letter from the Office of the DPP. There is credible and compelling evidence about the circumstances underlying the charge.\n[90] However, I still must assess whether the credible evidence establishes there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the elements of the crime of trafficking in persons set out in section 279.01 of the Criminal Code. The credible evidence sets out there are serious reasons for considering the following facts:\na. In 2013, the Appellant lured Y from Eritrea to Uganda with the promise of education and a high quality of life. He also promised that Y would eventually marry the Appellant's son.\nb. After arriving in Uganda on XXXX XXXX, 2013, Y was forced to have sex with the Appellant's son and became pregnant. She gave birth in XXXX 2014.\nc. The Appellant sexually exploited Y in his house. Y disclosed her experiences to her sister and the Appellant's wife at the time. Y witnessed the Appellant sexually assault other girls, seven of whom she names.\n[91] I find these facts establish there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant committed the elements of the of crime, which requires four elements.82\n[92] The first element is \"an action by the accused, who must be a person who 'recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds, conceals or harbours a person, or exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person.'\"83 There are serious reasons for considering the Appellant recruited and received Y in Uganda in 2013. The Appellant recruited Y through his false promises of the life she could expect in Uganda. The Appellant received Y as Y resided in his house.\n[93] The second element is that the actions must be for the purpose of exploiting or facilitating the exploitation of another person.84 Actual exploitation is not required. But where exploitation arises on the facts, \"inferring that the accused's purpose was to exploit the victim will usually be a relatively straightforward task.\"85 The third element is met if the person causes the other person to provide or offer to provide a service.86 Based on the credible evidence, there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant sexually exploited Y in Uganda in his house. There are also serious reasons for considering the Appellant's actions caused Y to engage in a sexual intercourse with the Appellant's son. She later gave birth to a child. I find such non-consensual, forced sexual exploitation and activity is labour or services within the meaning of exploitation.87 Based on the actual exploitation that arises on the facts, I infer the Appellant's purpose was to exploit Y.88\n[94] The fourth element is that the person causes the other person to provide or offer a service by \"engaging in conduct that, in all the circumstances, could reasonably be expected to cause the other person to believe that their safety or the safety of a person known to them would be threatened if they failed to provide, or offer to provide, the labour or service.\"89 I find there are serious reasons for considering the Appellant caused Y to provide labour or services by making Y fear for her safety. In 2013, Y was a young woman who had travelled to a new country alone, to reside with the Appellant in his house. She was isolated and there was dependency in this relationship. The Appellant also used deception in recruiting and receiving Y, in that she was promised education and a high quality of life, but was instead exploited. Y was only able to leave the situation by leaving Uganda. Based on Y's age, gender, and personal circumstances, I find there are serious reasons for considering she could reasonably be expected to believe her physical, mental, and psychological safety would be threatened if she failed to provide the labour and services to the Appellant and his son.90\n4. Crime is serious\n[95] I find the crime of trafficking in persons is serious.\n[96] The Appellant did not make submissions about whether the crime of trafficking in persons is serious.\n4.1 Crime is presumptively serious\n[97] Trafficking in persons is presumptively serious because if the crime were committed in Canada, it carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.91\n[98] Trafficking in persons can carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, where kidnapping, aggravated assaulted, aggravated sexual assault, or death are involved.92 However, I have not found those concurrent crimes are established in the Appellant's situation.\n4.2 Facts and elements of the crime\n[99] I find the facts and elements of the crime are serious.\n[100] The Appellant recruited and received Y in Uganda using deception. Y was a young woman, brought to a new country by false promises. She was isolated in the new country and there was dependency on the Appellant. After her arrival, the Appellant exploited Y. Her exploitation included non-consensual, forced sexual activity with the Appellant and the Appellant's son. I have found there are serious reasons for considering Y feared for her safety.\n[101] The facts and elements of the crime involve the intentional exploitation of a vulnerable young woman. They involve the violation of Y's dignity and security of the person. Such conduct is serious.\n4.3 Mode of prosecution \/ penalty prescribed\n[102] The prosecution did not pursue the charge against the Appellant, so there is no mode of prosecution to consider. Accordingly, there is also no penalty prescribed in Uganda to consider. These factors are neutral in my assessment.\n4.4 Mitigating circumstances\n[103] The Appellant has not identified any mitigating circumstances, either at the RPD or on appeal. I have considered whether there are mitigating circumstances in the Appellant's case that would weigh against a finding of seriousness. I find there are none.\n4.5 Aggravating circumstances\n[104] I find there are two aggravating circumstances.\n[105] The RPD found there were numerous aggravating factors that support a finding of seriousness, but did not set them out. The Appellant has not made submissions about this finding. However, I find it was wrong for the RPD to say there are numerous aggravating factors without explaining what those factors are.\n[106] I disagree with the RPD's finding that Y was under the age of 18 years at the time of the offence and that this is an aggravating factor as set out in section 718.2(a)(ii.1) of the Criminal Code. A court judgment from Uganda considered Y's age when she entered Uganda. It found she was 22 years old after reviewing foreign affairs entry documents and hospital documents where she indicated her date of birth.93 Although I am not bound by that court's finding of facts, I find the document credible. Given the court explained its reasoning and referenced the evidence before it, I agree with its determination about Y's age.\n[107] However, I find the fact that the Appellant sexually exploited Y is an aggravating circumstance. The IRPA states this is an aggravating factor in its section prohibiting trafficking of persons.94 I also find the duration of the crime is an aggravating circumstance. The crime occurred over a period of approximately two years, from 2013 to 2015. This represents a protracted period of time in which Y was exploited and feared for her safety.\n4.6 Canadian sentencing range\n[108] The Canadian sentencing range for the crime of trafficking in persons spans from four to eight years. Even if the Appellant's situation would place him at the four-year end of this range, I find four years imprisonment is a considerable period of imprisonment that weighs in favour of seriousness.\n[109] The Appellant has not identified any sentencing decisions, either at the RPD or on appeal, which would support a finding that the Appellant's trafficking in persons crime would be on the lower end of the sentencing range had the crime been committed in Canada. The Appellant also has not identified any factual circumstances that point to a short sentence for a comparable crime in Canada. Nevertheless, I must still grapple with the Canadian sentencing range. The jurisprudence requires this to ensure the presumption of seriousness (for crimes where a maximum sentence of imprisonment of ten years or more could have been imposed if the crime were committed in Canada) is not applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner.95\n[110] In Siwak, the Federal Court upheld an exclusion finding, noting that \"the applicant's submissions did not refer the RPD to Canadian case law showing a low range of sentence that would be imposed for the [crime] if it had occurred in Canada, to argue that his offence was not 'serious.'\"96 The Federal Court also commented that the RPD was responsive to the submissions before it and that \"[t]his is not a case in which the RPD failed to recognize factual circumstances that pointed to a short sentence for the offence in Canada, or did not grapple meaningfully with a key submission that his conduct would have been on the low end of the sentencing range that would be imposed by a Canadian court for an equivalent offence.\"97\n[111] Although section 279.01 sets out a mandatory minimum sentence, courts have found this mandatory minimum sentence to be unconstitutional.98 I have not considered the mandatory minimum sentence in assessing what sentence the Appellant could receive were the crime committed in Canada.\n[112] Recent sentencing decisions state the usual sentencing range for trafficking in persons spans from four to eight years.99 Even if the Appellant's situation would place him at the four-year end of the range, I find four years imprisonment is a considerable period of imprisonment. Additionally, the jurisprudence does not state that crimes are serious only where a person would receive a term of imprisonment in Canada of ten years or more. Rather, the jurisprudence states that where a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more could be imposed in Canada, the crime is presumptively serious. The Canadian sentencing range is then considered as one factor to ensure the presumption is not applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner.100\n4.7 RAD conclusion\n[113] The crime of trafficking in persons is presumptively serious. The serious facts and elements of the crime and aggravating circumstances are significant. There are no mitigating circumstances. The mode of prosecution and penalty prescribed are neutral. The Canadian sentencing range for the crime represents four to eight years imprisonment. Even if the Appellant were sentenced at the four-year end of this range, four years is a considerable period of imprisonment. When I weigh all these factors, I find they do not rebut the presumption of seriousness.\n5. Crime is non-political\n[114] I find the crime is non-political. The Appellant did not submit the crime was committed for a political purpose and the evidence does not establish such a purpose.\n6. Conclusion on exclusion\n[115] In summary, I find the Appellant is excluded from protection because there are serious reasons for considering he committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge.\nThe exclusion finding is determinative of the Appellant's claim. It is therefore not necessary for me to determine whether he has citizenship in Uganda or whether he has established a claim for protection against Eritrea (and possibly Uganda).\nCONCLUSION\n[116] I dismiss the appeal. I confirm the determination of the RPD that the Appellant is excluded from protection because there are serious reasons for considering he committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge. He is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nT. Acton\nT.

She is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated October 12, 2022, rejecting her claim for refugee protection.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The determinative issue is the absence of a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[3] The appellant did not present any new evidence so I could not hold an oral hearing.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The appellant alleges that she is a Roman Catholic and at risk of being arrested and beaten in Vietnam by the authorities for practicing her faith. The appellant was first introduced to Catholicism in XXXX 2018 by her sister. In XXXX 2018 she accompanied her sister to her church for the first time and attended services regularly thereafter. The appellant came to Canada in XXXX 2019 and XXXX 2019 to accompany her daughter who was studying here. The appellant alleges that in XXXX 2019 the local police came to her church and told the congregants to register with the government. In late XXXX 2019, the appellant alleges that she began to attend house church services with about 10-15 people in attendance. The appellant returned to Canada in XXXX 2020. In early XXXX 2020, she alleges that she learned from her sister that four members of the house church were arrested, beaten and detained for a day. The house church stopped its services. Her son later told her that the police had come to their home in Vietnam looking for her. Fearing for her safety the appellant made a claim for refugee protection on July 27, 2020.\nANALYSIS\n[5] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1\n[6] The RPD determined that the appellant did not credibly establish that she is a Roman Catholic or that she is wanted by the police. The RPD also determined that if the appellant was a Roman Catholic, the objective evidence did not support that she would be persecuted because of her faith.\n[7] The appellant argues that the RPD erred in its credibility findings about her religious identity and her being of interest to the authorities. She submits that the RPD erred in finding that she can enjoy religious freedom as long as she limits her practice and refrains from activities that may be seen as political, thus limiting her religious practice. The appellant also argues that the RPD erred in finding that she can freely practice her faith in Vietnam as this is not supported by the objective evidence.\nThe appellant is a Roman Catholic\n[8] I agree with the appellant that the RPD erred in its assessment of her religious identity.\n[9] The RPD found the appellant not credible because she identified herself at the hearing as following Christianity but answered no when she was asked if she belonged to a particular sect.2 The appellant, however, immediately then replied in the affirmative when told by the RPD that in her Basis of Claim (BOC), she identified herself as being Roman Catholic. Further, the appellant testified that she believed Christianity and Catholicism are one and could not distinguish the two.3 The RPD itself acknowledges in its reasons that Catholicism is a denomination of Christianity. I agree with the appellant that the RPD was being microscopic in its assessment of the evidence in this regard and erred in drawing a negative inference.\n[10] I also agree with the appellant that the RPD was overzealous in dealing with her testimony about the name of the church she attends in Canada. The appellant testified that the name on the front of the church is 'XXXX XXXX, the RPD provided that the full name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.4 The appellant reasonably provided that she did not know English and that is how she understood the name. As the appellant understands neither English nor French, she should not be penalized for not providing the full name of the church. Again, the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference with respect to the appellant's credibility.\n[11] The RPD was also wrong to find that the appellant's credibility was undermined when she misspoke about when she began to follow her faith. The appellant originally stated XXXX 2019 but then corrected herself when the RPD mentioned that her BOC stated XXXX 2018. The appellant told the RPD that she was shaking and nervous and the RPD tried to relax her.5 The appellant then went on to describe how her business difficulties in XXXX 2018 led her to start following the faith.\n[12] The appellant was able to identify the Old and New Testaments of the Bible and how they were made up of different books, although she erred in how many books the Old Testament consisted of. She was also able to identify the holy days of her faith and provide some description of the same.6 The courts have provided that in assessing the genuineness of faith, administrative tribunals should not engage in trivia like questions and the standard of knowledge of a claimant is low. The RPD erred in drawing a negative inference from the appellant's knowledge of her faith. Given the appellant's level of education and that she has been practicing her faith only since late-2018, I find that she demonstrated a level of knowledge that is commensurate with her practice. I find that, on the balance of probabilities, the appellant is Roman Catholic.\nThe appellant is not wanted in Vietnam\n[13] The appellant provided in her BOC that her sister advised her in XXXX 2020 that there was a problem at the house church she attended and that four members were arrested. She also states that her son told her that the police had come to their home in XXXX 2020 and asked him about her.\n[14] The appellant testified that the police visited her son and interviewed him in the beginning of XXXX, 2020.7 She provided that they came many times but could only explain that they came a few days after she had left for Canada and then vaguely stated that the police would find her when it is a holiday or New Year and that they came to see if she had returned home.8 The RPD drew a negative inference, finding that the appellant's testimony was vague and evasive on this issue.\n[15] I do not agree with the appellant that the RPD was being microscopic in its approach in this regard. I agree that the mere fact that the appellant does not know the precise number of police visits does not undermine her allegation. However, the appellant was evasive and vague in her testimony about how often the police had gone to her home. She could only clearly identify the occasion in XXXX 2020 that coincided with her BOC and letter from her son. The appellant testified that she keeps in contact with her son in Vietnam. If the police were visiting her home searching for her 'many times', I would expect that the appellant could provide clearer testimony about when and under what circumstances these visits happened. Afterall, it is being arrested and beaten by the police that the appellant alleges is what she fears in Vietnam, yet she could not provide concise or clear testimony about the police visits to her home.\n[16] I also do not agree with the appellant that the RPD erred when it determined it improbable that the police knew of her affiliation with her church. The appellant submits that this was an implausibility finding by the RPD. I find it to be a credibility issue. She argues that it was unfair of the RPD to ask the appellant about something she did not know for sure. I do not agree. The RPD cannot know in advance what the appellant knew for sure. At the onset of the hearing the RPD informed the appellant about how it would question her and advised her that if she did not know the answer to a question that it would be fine to state that.9 The appellant testified that when the police came to the church in XXXX 2019 she was there but did not speak to them as she ran away.10 The RPD then reasonably asked how she had even come to the attention of the police given that she had fled the church and not spoken to them, the appellant replied that the local police knew everyone there. She further informed that the church was located in district XXXX of Ho Chi Minh City. The objective evidence shows that Ho Chi Minh City is the largest city in Vietnam with a population for over 9 million.11 Even if the city consisted of hundreds of districts or wards, a local ward or district would likely consist of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people. I find that the appellant was speculating when she stated that the police knew everyone that was at the church, she had no contact with them previously and fled when they attended her church. The appellant did not credibly establish that the police are aware that she is a member of her church. The RPD did not err.\n[17] The appellant provided a letter12 from her son dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022. He informs that the police visited his home in XXXX 2020 looking for the appellant. He also states that they had continued to come to the home during the holidays and the Dragon Boat Festival but does not provide any dates, it is unclear if the subsequent visits also took place in 2020 or at another time. It is also not clear why the police sought her. They may have wanted to ask her about the church she attended or about the other members or leaders, or in relation to the arrests of the others, her son writes only vaguely that they came about her 'religious beliefs abroad.' I find the letter establishes that the police looked for the appellant in XXXX 2020 and some other time during the holidays. I find the letter does not establish that the police continue to seek the appellant because of her Roman Catholic religion, I assign it little weight in establishing the appellant's allegation that she is wanted by the police in Vietnam.\n[18] There is nothing in the record to suggest that the police have ever issued a summons for the appellant or a warrant for her arrest, a recourse that is available to them under the Vietnamese law,13 and the appellant testified that the police did not leave any papers when they visited her son.14 A letter15 from the Appellant's sister corroborates her introduction to Christianity, attendance at church and the arrest of fellow church members. The letter does not help in establishing that the appellant is facing a forward-looking risk from the Vietnamese authorities, I assign it little weight. The evidence provided by the Appellant is not sufficient enough for me to draw the conclusion that she continues to be of interest to the Vietnamese police. I agree with the RPD and find that, on a balance of probabilities, the evidence does not support that the Appellant is wanted by the Vietnamese police.\nThe appellant can freely practice her faith in an unregistered church\n[19] The RPD found that, in the alternative, if the appellant is a Roman Catholic, she can practice her faith freely in Vietnam without persecution. The RPD found that there was insufficient evidence that registered and unregistered churches in Vietnam practiced the religion differently or that Catholics are persecuted solely for their religious beliefs. The appellant argues that freedoms afforded to registered groups is irrelevant as she is not willing to join a registered church. She also argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of the objective documentary evidence and that her religious freedom would be restricted by the authorities.\n[20] The appellant testified that when she returned to Vietnam, she spoke to fellow church members about her experience with the church in Canada and while she has never posted anything on social media that would be considered anti-government, she believed that the authorities might think that she was 'badmouthing' them because friends may tell others about religious freedom in Canada. I find this to be speculation on behalf of the appellant. There is no evidence to support her belief that people were speaking outside of the church or that this talk would be attributed to her, let alone that the authorities would perceive her as 'badmouthing' them.\n[21] She also testified that she believed that registered churches do not believe in Jesus and do not speak the truth about Jesus. She believed that registered churches practiced differently because nuns used to teach in her school while she was in grade four, but after the liberation came, the nuns were not allowed to teach anymore, and she lost the belief in the registered church.16\n[22] The Constitution of Vietnam guarantees freedom of religion and belief;17 however it is regulated by the 2018 Law on Religion and Belief. The objective evidence shows that the Vietnamese Government recognizes 39 religious organizations and that one quarter of the population, about 24 million Vietnamese are religious. Of those, 7% identify as Catholic.18 Vietnam has over 25,000 places of worship in the country and about 9,000 religious festivals per year.19\n[23] Catholicism is a recognized religion in Vietnam. The objective evidence shows that, generally, members of officially recognized religions can practice their religion freely for the most part, and that relations with the Catholic church are improving.20 In general, Catholics are able to worship freely and receive sacraments such as the Eucharist and Confirmation.21\n[24] The treatment of religious groups and individuals will vary depending on whether they are recognized or registered or not, the area they are based in, local issues, ethnicity, and the perceived level of threat they represent.22 Members of unregistered religious organizations that get involved in local political issues or advocates for democracy have been subject to harassment, arrest, and detention.23 The evidence also indicates that Catholics who are perceived to challenge the interests of the Communist Party by being politically active face a moderate risk of official discrimination from the authorities, including arrest.24\n[25] The appellant cites a Report from a United Nations Special Rapporteur25 which states that many religious adherents face arbitrary arrest, detention and prison. I note that the report is almost a decade old and predates the 2018 Law on Religion and Belief. A careful review of the section cited by the appellant shows that arrests under Article 258 of the Penal Code for 'offending democracy' and 'partaking in a separatist movement' refers to individuals engaging in advocacy and includes those of varying religious or belief backgrounds. The same report concludes that the space for religious practice had increased in recent years, religious groups previously forbidden are now allowed to operate, and that diverse religious life has become a visible reality in all parts of the country with different religious communities coexisting peacefully.\n[26] More currently, an Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) Response to Information Request (RIR)26 on the treatment of Christians in Vietnam indicates that there were reports that authorities still monitored and harassed some unregistered groups, but that in most cases, members of those groups were also involved in human rights advocacy or were linked to individuals and organizations that were critical of the government.27 The report identifies discrimination amongst the ethnic minority religious groups such as the Hmong and Montagnard. Relations between the government and the Catholic church are described as 'improving' and 'cordial' but that land disputes remain an issue.\n[27] While the United States Department of State (USDOS) International Religious Freedom Report does state that religion, ethnicity and politics are often closely linked thus making it difficult to categorize incidents solely as being based on religious identity, it also states that religious leaders reported better relations between unregistered religious groups and local authorities. I acknowledge that the report provides numerous instances of arrest, monitoring and harassment across groups of various religious beliefs and ethnicities, however it also states that those living in urban areas and the ethnic-majority Kinh reported that they were permitted to practice with little interference if they acted transparently and facilitated official oversight. Importantly, this was true for both officially registered and unregistered groups.28 This is echoed in other objective evidence that indicates that large cities, such as Ho Chi Minh City, tend to be more open to religious groups with no official interference.29 The appellant is of Kinh ethnicity and resides in Ho Chi Minh City.30\n[28] The evidence indicates that while members of unregistered groups may face discrimination, it does not necessarily raise to the level of persecution.31 The risk depends on the views of the group toward the state, the state's view of the group, and the activities of the person. The appellant is not politically active, she worshipped in a church and also a house church for a brief period of time, and her group services consisted of prayer and talking about Jesus.32 The group held no animus towards the state. The Appellant's profile is not one that suggests that she faces a serious possibility of persecution, I do not agree with her assertion that she would face religious persecution in Vietnam simply for her being a member of an unregistered house church. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, given the personal circumstances of the Appellant, she can freely practice Catholicism in Vietnam.\n[29] I find that there is not a serious possibility that the Appellant would be persecuted if she returned to Vietnam, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). I also find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Vietnam, pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nRon Stratigopoulos\nRon Stratigopoulos\n15 March 2023\nDate\n1 Huruglica v.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant), a citizen of Colombia, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated October 18, 2022, rejecting his claim for refugee protection under either section 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nDECISION\n[2] I find that the RPD did not err in its decision that the Appellant is neither a Convention2 refugee nor a person in need of protection. I further find that the determinative factor regarding the application of both section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA is the availability of a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Colombia. I therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.3\nOVERVIEW\n[3] At the time of the events surrounding his claim, the Appellant lived in Bogot\u00e1, Columbia, where, in XXXX 2019, he started his own XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX business. The Appellant alleged in his Basis of Claim (BOC) that on XXXX XXXX, 2021 he realized that a recently acquired customer, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was using the Appellant's XXXX business to shuttle bags of weapons to destinations in barrios within Bogot\u00e1 (after witnessing firearms spill out during the unloading of one of XXXX's bags). XXXX subsequently approached the Appellant and allegedly revealed himself to be \"Commander XXXX of the XXXX XXXX of the Aguilas Negras (Black Eagles).\" He instructed the Appellant to continue their business relationship of transporting XXXX's bags, but to ignore what the Appellant had seen spilling out of the bags. XXXX also threatened the Appellant's mother with unspecified consequences, should he report what he witnessed to the police. Notwithstanding, the Appellant alleges he reported what he had seen to an Officer XXXX of the National Police, who privately told him to remain silent.\n[4] The Appellant alleges that, a few days later, he was threatened as a snitch by two men on motorcycles when he collected his younger brother at the airport and, frightened, the Appellant relocated to Medell\u00edn on XXXX XXXX, 2021. The Appellant alleges he learned a few weeks later that Castro had been asking about him at his Bogot\u00e1 workplace. Three weeks later, the Appellant's younger brother received a call on his mobile phone that XXXX considered the Appellant a \"military objective.\" The Appellant returned to Bogot\u00e1, where he lived until XXXX XXXX, 2021, when he flew to Canada. He claimed protection on December 13, 2021.\n[5] A hearing was held on September 23, 2022. The issue of a viable IFA in the cities of Barranquilla, Cali and Cartagena was canvassed. The Appellant was represented by counsel at the hearing. The RPD reserved its decision and issued its Reasons on October 18, 2022, making the following findings:\na) The National Documentation Package for Colombia (NDP) indicates that the criminal organization Aguilas Negras, allegedly led by the agent of harm, Commander XXXX, does not exist;\nb) The profile of the Appellant was not such as conformed with the profile of those usually targeted for threats (academics, liberals social and indigenous rights leaders) by those who issue threats using the name Aguilas Negras;\nc) Although the RPD accepted that XXXX likely operated an illegal arms transport business in Bogot\u00e1's barrios, there was no evidence to show that his influence reached beyond Bogot\u00e1, particularly given the distance of almost XXXX kilometres between the two cities;\nd) A viable IFA for the Appellant exists for the Appellant in Barranquilla, both prongs satisfied.\n[6] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred:\na) In making erroneous findings concerning the existence of the Aguilas Negras without regard to the entirety of the evidence;\nb) The evidence in the NDP supports the finding that the Aguilas Negras exist and that they and Commander XXXX have a presence outside of Bogot\u00e1;\nc) In making a finding regarding the means of the Aguilas Negras to pursue the Appellant by erroneously restricting its analysis to the means of Commander XXXX to reach beyond Bogot\u00e1;\nd) Erroneously relied on the profile of those who the NDP indicated were usually targeted by the Aguilas Negras-the fact that the Appellant had seen the guns spilling out of the bag and therefore, as an eyewitness, could identify XXXX-was sufficient to make him a threat and therefore, a target;\ne) Erroneously relied on the distance between Bogot\u00e1 and Barranquilla in an age of cyber-communication which renders geographical distance irrelevant;\n[7] The Appellant is not disclosing any new evidence nor is he requesting an oral hearing.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[8] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in assessing and weighing oral testimony. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.4\nANALYSIS\nIFA\n[9] There is a two-pronged test for assessing an IFA:5\n(1) The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimants would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) The conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimants to seek refuge there.\nBoth prongs of the test must be satisfied to find that the Appellant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and potential IFAs identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellant to show that he does not have an IFA.\n[10] The RPD found that a viable IFA existed in Barranquilla and that both prongs were satisfied. The Appellant argues on appeal that the RPD erred in its analysis of the viability of the IFA, specifically, in concluding that the agents of harm do not have the motivation or the ability to find the Appellant in Barranquilla and also argues that Barranquilla is not reasonable as an IFA for the Appellant. I have independently reviewed the record before me.\nThe first prong\nThe means to pursue the Appellant\n[11] I find the agents of harm do not have the means to pursue the Appellant to the identified IFA of Barranquilla. The RPD referred to the objective evidence in the NDP concerning the Aguilas Negras and found that, according to the most recent country condition evidence in the NDP, either the Aguilas Negras do not exist as an armed group or there is no armed group by that name with members-although the evidence supports a finding that individuals, and paramilitary (and former military) groups commonly use the name Aguilas Negras as a cover when issuing threats to social leaders.6 On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred by disregarding the foundational evidence in the reference articles of the NDP items, that support the existence of the Aguilas Negras and also erroneously interpreted the evidence concerning: a) the profile of the Aguilas Negras, b) the profile of the Appellant and c) the continued or willing intent of the Aguilas Negras to pursue the Appellant. I have independently reviewed the record before me.\nThe threat posed by the Aguilas Negras\n[12] The objective evidence in the NDP (including the extended materials cited as references at the conclusion of the various items), indicates that the Aguilas Negras is not a currently-active armed group, but the name of a now-defunct paramilitary group that emerged in the demobilization process between 2003 and 2006, and that while the Aguilas Negras may have been active as recently as 2014, as of 2023, it is merely a name deployed by disparate, reactionary individuals to add heft when making \"blind threats.\"7 The name is often used, according to police, by criminals and a variety of right-wing, military and paramilitary groups to threaten their opponents-social activists, academics, indigenous activists and liberal leaders of civil society, from behind the mask of a defunct, non-existent organization.8 The objective evidence indicates that the name Aguilas Negras is principally used when publishing threatening blogs and mass threats in letters, and pamphlets. For example, pamphlets were sent in 2021 to a number of liberal academics at a university in Medell\u00edn under the name Aguilas Negras.9 None of the evidence in the NDP however, indicates that the Aguilas Negras is an active, organized group. Nor is there evidence that indicates that the activities undertaken under the name Aguilas Negras go beyond making threats and publishing threatening missives. Nor is there evidence in the NDP that indicates that the Aguilas Negras are even a disparate series of groups that function independently. In sum, taken as a whole, the evidence in the NDP indicates that the Aguilas Negras is most likely nothing more substantive than a brand, used by different parties, with different agendas, to intimidate-but lacking membership, structure or leadership. The evidence in the NDP lists a number of departments in Colombia where elements using the name Aguilas Negras have been active, but this list in the NDP does not include the department of Atl\u00e1ntico, where the city of Barranquilla is located.10 I therefore find that the Appellant has not established that the alleged agent of harm-the Aguilas Negras-has a presence that would pose a threat to the Appellant were he to relocate to Barranquilla.\nThe threat posed by XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[13] I find the Appellant has not established that XXXX has the means to pursue him to the IFA. The RPD considered the threat posed by the person using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX (or Commander XXXX) and accepted that such a person likely does operate an illicit arms business in the city of Bogot\u00e1, transporting arms to the city's barrios. The RPD, however, found that the evidence did not support a finding that XXXX was part of-or that the Appellant had been threatened by-an organized paramilitary or guerilla group with a large network or with an extended vertical organization or even that XXXX had a presence or influence beyond Bogot\u00e1. On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred by erroneously interpreting the evidence in the NDP to conclude that the only agent of harm was a criminal individual-XXXX, and not a commander of the Aguilas Negras.\n[14] Having independently considered the record and the objective evidence in the NDP, I, too, concur with the finding of the RPD, and accept that, on the balance of probabilities, XXXX likely operates an illicit arms trade in the barrios of the city of Bogot\u00e1. The Appellant has disclosed no evidence, nor has he given any testimony to substantiate a finding that XXXX is part of, or affiliated with, either a paramilitary or guerilla group, or a criminal organization that has influence beyond Bogot\u00e1. Although the Appellant testified that his brother received a telephone call on his mobile while outside of Bogot\u00e1, the Appellant has disclosed no evidence to show that the potential agent of harm was aware that the Appellant's brother was not in Bogot\u00e1 at the time of the call. I have already found, having reviewed the objective evidence in the NDP, that the Aguilas Negras do not exist as an actual organization with members or structure or leadership. I further find that the evidence does not support a finding that XXXX, as an individual operating in the city of Bogot\u00e1, possesses influence in the identified IFA of Barranquilla. I further find that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that XXXX is anything more than an isolated operator in Bogot\u00e1, or that he has the capacity to even learn of the Appellant's relocation to Barranquilla, let alone to pursue him to that city.\nThe motivation to pursue the Appellant to Barranquilla\n[15] Having already found that the alleged agents of harm do not possess the means to pursue the Appellant to Barranquilla, I do not need to find that they also lack the motivation, as the test requires that the agents of harm possess both the means and motivation. Notwithstanding, I have independently assessed whether the alleged agents of harm also have the motivation to pursue the Appellant to Barranquilla.\n[16] I find the agents of harm do not have the motivation to pursue the Appellant to Barranquilla. Regarding the Appellant's personal profile, the RPD found that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the Appellant possessed a visible profile in Colombia related to his XXXX studies, his employment or self-employment, or any past community involvement. The RPD found that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that XXXX or any associates had a continuing interest in pursuing the Appellant, particularly outside Bogot\u00e1. The RPD also found that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that XXXX, the men who the Appellant alleged he had seen unloading guns, or the men who intercepted the claimant using their motorcycle, would have the motivation to pursue the Appellant to Barranquilla, as it was almost a XXXX kilometres from Bogot\u00e1.\n[17] On appeal, the Appellant argues that his personal profile is wholly irrelevant. The fact that the Appellant saw guns spilling out of the torn suitcase-and thus became aware of the illegal transport of firearms-is the only pertinent element of the Appellant's profile. He learned XXXX was engaging in illegal activity and thereby became a threat to XXXX as the Appellant could now identify XXXX in court. The Appellant argues that this was the only reason he was targeted by XXXX and the Aguilas Negras.\n[18] I have independently reviewed the record before me. The Appellant alleged that his younger brother had been told that the Appellant had been targeted as a \"military objective.\" The objective evidence in the NDP indicates that those who have been targeted as a \"military objective\" are leaders or prominent persons in their communities, providing examples of human-rights activists, lawyers, and liberal politicians.11 I find that the RPD did not err in its analysis and that the Appellant's profile in no way conforms to that identified in the NDP as being those typically identified as \"military objectives\" and therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the Appellant has been targeted as military objective.\n[19] The Appellant, however, argues that the fact that the Appellant saw guns spilling out of the torn suitcase-and thus became aware of the illegal transport of firearms-is the only pertinent element of the Appellant's profile and that XXXX is motivated to pursue the Appellant in order to avoid being identified by the Appellant in a court of law. The Appellant has disclosed no evidence that the police have ever questioned him regarding XXXX or asked him to provide information or in any way ever followed up with the Appellant after the one meeting he allegedly had with Officer XXXX of the National Police. Indeed, the Appellant alleged in his narrative that although Officer XXXX allegedly told the Appellant he would be sent a completed copy of his denunciation, none ever arrived. Nor did any member of the police ever contact the Appellant subsequently. The Appellant has disclosed no evidence to suggest that his denunciation was acted upon or that XXXX is currently being pursued by law enforcement and, as such, I find assigning motivation to XXXX on this basis would be speculative.\n[20] The RPD found that the distance of almost a XXXX kilometres between Bogot\u00e1 and Barranquilla was a factor in analyzing the motivation of XXXX to pursue the Appellant beyond Bogot\u00e1, finding that the evidence did not support a finding that XXXX had the reach or the willingness to target the Appellant in Barranquilla. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in emphasizing the distance between Bogot\u00e1 and Barranquilla, as, in an age of cyber-communication, geographical distance irrelevant. The Appellant alleged and testified that none of the approaches to him made by XXXX or an associate, took place outside of the city of Bogot\u00e1. There is no evidence to show that even the telephone call received by the Appellant's brother indicated XXXX's awareness that the brother was not in Bogot\u00e1. I find, therefore, that the evidence does not support a finding that XXXX has been motivated to exercise any influence beyond Bogot\u00e1 or galvanize any associates beyond the barrios of Bogot\u00e1, the site of all the Appellant's dealings with XXXX.\n[21] I therefore find that, as the alleged agents of harm lack both the means and the motivation to pursue the Appellant beyond Bogot\u00e1 to Barranquilla, the first prong is satisfied.\nThe second prong\n[22] Every relocation entails hardship. The threshold is whether it is objectively reasonable to expect the claimant to relocate, or stated another way, whether a claimant will encounter undue hardship in travelling or staying in the proposed IFA.12 The Federal Court of Appeal, in Ranganathan, found that hardship associated with dislocation and relocation is not generally in itself sufficient to render an IFA unreasonable. The Court in that decision set out:\n\"[A] very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized.\"13\n[23] In this appeal, I find the RPD did not err in its analysis of the second prong of the test and I find the Appellant has not shown that the IFA of Barranquilla fails on the second prong.\n[24] The RPD found that the Appellant, possessing a XXXX XXXX and having been continuously employed in Colombia, as well as having been employed in a variety of new endeavours in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX in Canada, would likely be able to find employment in Barranquilla. The RPD further found that, as the Appellant's first language was Spanish, and his faith was Roman Catholic that the Appellant would also likely be able to find places of worship and accommodation in Barranquilla and that, for all these reasons, the city of Barranquilla was not unreasonable as an IFA for the Appellant. The Appellant has not challenged these findings of the RPD regarding the reasonableness of Barranquilla.\n[25] I have independently reviewed the record before me as regards the reasonableness of Barranquilla as an IFA for the Appellant and I also find that, for all the above reasons, the RPD did not err in its assessment of Barranquilla, which I also find to be not unreasonable as an IFA for the Appellant.\n[26] I find, therefore, for all the above reasons, that there is no serious possibility that the Appellant faces persecution, or that on a balance of probabilities, he faces a danger of torture, a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should he relocate to the city of Barranquilla.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAndrea Poole\nAndrea Poole\nMarch 30, 2023\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n3 IRPA, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, at para 111(1)(a).\n4 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

I note that the Principal Appellant is the designated representative for both Minor Appellants. For the reasons set out below, the appeal is dismissed.\n[2] The Appellants allege that they fear persecution in Mexico at the hands of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (the \"Cartel\" or \"CJNG\"). They state that in XXXX 2018 the Principal Appellant opened a XXXX XXXX in their hometown of XXXX, Puebla, but beginning in XXXX 2019 the business started to receive threatening phone calls. The Principal Appellant states that on XXXX XXXX, 2019, the business received a call from someone affiliated with the Cartel, who asked for the owner, but that he did not take the call. He states that on XXXX XXXX, 2019, he was pulled over on the way home from work, and assaulted by Cartel members who demanded that the business pay XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos per month in protection money. He notes that they phoned him the next day to tell him that the fee had been raised to XXXX XXXX XXXX per month. The Appellants then went to stay at the home of the mother1 of the Associate Appellant until XXXX XXXX, 2019, and on XXXX XXXX, they went to stay with the Principal Appellant's aunt in Mexico City. The Principal Appellant states that he received another threatening phone call on XXXX XXXX, 2019, demanding the payment and that on XXXX XXXX, 2019 they filed a police complaint.\n[3] The Appellants travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and claimed asylum upon arrival at the airport.\n[4] The RPD rejected the claim, holding that the Appellants had an internal flight alternative (IFA) in the city of Merida. It specifically found that:\n(a) As the claim was based on criminality, there was no nexus to any Convention2 ground, and the Appellants were not Convention refugees. It thus analyzed the claim under subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA);3\n(b) The credibility of the Principal Appellant's claim that his brother had been approached three or four months before the RPD hearing by the Cartel seeking information on his location was a late embellishment to bolster the claim, given that this information was not in his materials, but had suddenly emerged during the hearing;\n(c) It was also concerning that the Appellants' supporting documentation did not identify the extortionists as being from the Cartel;\n(d) Regardless, the Appellants had a viable internal flight alternative in Merida as: the Principal Appellant had failed to establish in evidence that the Cartel, which beyond having twice telephoned him, had not otherwise confronted him in Mexico or sought to track him since the incident on the road, and was thus not motivated to seek to pursue and harm him in the proposed IFA;\n(e) Finally, it was not unreasonable for the Appellants to seek refuge in the proposed IFA as: 1) there is a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test, which requires conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of an Appellant to make an IFA unreasonable; and 2) the RPD did not find the proposed IFA unreasonable, given the Principal and Associate Appellants' language skills, business and work experience; and\n(f) Accordingly, as a viable IFA existed, the Appellants were not persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[5] The Appellants have appealed the RPD's decision and are now asking that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) recognize them as Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, or that it refer the matter back to the RPD for redetermination.4 They are seeking to submit as new evidence two online articles and have requested an oral hearing before the RAD.5\n[6] The Appellants argue that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, as the RPD erred in its assessment and determination that a safe and reasonable IFA existed for them in Merida. In particular, they argue that:\n(a) With respect to the credibility of their claim that the Principal Appellant's brother had been approached about the location of the Principal Appellant, the RPD erred in finding that this was an embellishment as it had been over-vigilant and microscopic in its analysis, since a lack of details should not have been held to undermine his credibility;\n(b) With respect to the potential risk they would face in the IFA, the RPD's finding that the Cartel was not motivated to locate the Appellants, because it had largely not searched for or disturbed them in Mexico, beyond making a few phone calls, was erroneous speculation on the part of the RPD; and\n(c) In terms of the reasonableness of the proposed IFAs, proposed new evidence indicated that various cartels now had a presence in those cities, and this would jeopardize their lives and safety.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the Decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to subsection 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[8] The Refugee Appeal Division reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it.6 The exception to this rule is that the RAD may apply a deferential standard in certain circumstances where the RPD has a meaningful advantage in the assessment of credibility.7 I have conducted my own independent assessment of all of the evidence in this case, including the transcript and oral recording of the RPD hearing. I find the appropriate standard in this case to be one of correctness.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND HEARING REQUEST\n[9] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA sets out that an appellant may only present evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim, or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection. Where such evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4), the RAD will then go on to consider the additional factors affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Raza and Singh,8 including the credibility, relevance and newness of the evidence.\n[10] In this matter, the Appellants have submitted as new evidence the following two online articles: \"Guacamaya Leaks: Yucatan, among the states of southeastern Mexico plagued by cartels\", dated October 12, 2022, Mexico Daily Post website (the \"Leaks Article\");9 and \"Guacamaya Leaks reveals drug cartels presence in Yucatan\", dated October 14, 2022, Yucatan Times website (the \"Cartels in Yucatan Article\").10\n[11] I find that both articles may be admitted as new evidence. Though neither article post-dates the rejection of his claim, as the RPD's decision was October 21, 2022, I am prepared to accept that the Appellants could not have been reasonably expected to present these articles before that time, given that both pieces were published mere days beforehand. As a result, I find that the articles satisfy subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. I also find that they satisfy the Singh\/Raza criteria. In my view, the articles are credible, as I have no reason to doubt their source or circumstances. I also find that they are relevant, as the articles are capable of proving a fact relevant to the claim - namely, the current areas of operation of certain Mexican cartels, including the CJNG. I finally further find that this evidence is new, in that it is capable of contradicting the RPD's finding of fact11 that the CJNG lacks a presence in the proposed IFA location, as both articles directly state that the CJNG is indeed now in Merida.12\n[12] Finally, I note that while the Appellants have requested an oral hearing,13 I cannot find that such a hearing may be held pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, since even the accepted new evidence would not justify allowing the refugee claim. This is because, as will be discussed below, while the new evidence pertains to the issue of the means of the alleged persecutors to locate the Appellants in the proposed IFA, I find that regardless of this, it has not been established that those parties are motivated to utilize those means to locate and strike at the Appellants in the proposed IFAs.\nANALYSIS\nSummary\n[13] The RPD found that the Appellants have a viable IFA in the city of Merida and held, for this reason, that the Appellants are not persons in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. It also found that they were not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there was no nexus to a Convention ground in this matter. Upon my own review of the evidence, while I do not agree with all of the RPD's findings, as shall be discussed below, I find that RPD did not err in its ultimate conclusion that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, and I agree with the RPD's key findings. This includes the RPD's determination that: the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution because they have not established that those they fear have the motivation to locate them in the proposed IFA; and that this city is a reasonable IFA in the circumstances for the Appellants, who appear relatively well positioned to secure employment and assimilate there, given their language ability and work background.\nNO NEXUS TO A CONVENTION GROUND\n[14] Upon my own analysis of the evidence and record, I find, as did the RPD, that in this matter there is no nexus to a Convention ground, as the Appellants have not established that the reason for the harm that they allege that they suffered in Mexico was due to persecution relating to any of the grounds in the Convention.\n[15] As the Appellants were allegedly targeted by the Cartel solely as a result of a monetary extortion demand related to their business, I instead find that the allegations made by the Appellants are essentially criminal in nature. I note that criminal acts generally do not establish a nexus to a Convention ground,14 unless the acts can be shown to have been motivated by an appellant's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. As, from the evidence, that was not the case in this matter, I accordingly find there is no nexus to any Convention ground. The Appellants are thus not Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I will now turn to analyzing the claim under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, to determine if they are persons in need of protection under that provision.\nTHE RPD DID NOT ERR IN ITS CREDIBILITY FINDINGS\nThe RPD did not err in finding that the omission of the Principal Appellant's claim that the Cartel had approached his brother-in-law undermined his credibility\n[16] While the RPD largely accepted the credibility of the Appellants' allegations as to the extortion attempt by the Cartel, it specifically rejected the Principal Appellant's sudden claim in testimony that the Cartel had approached his brother-in-law three or four months before the RPD hearing. The RPD noted that, while the Principal Appellant suddenly stated during the hearing that the brother-in-law he sold the XXXX XXXX to had been approached by Cartel members seeking the Appellants' location (as well as then extorted himself as the current owner of the XXXX XXXX), no mention of this had ever been included in the Appellants' materials. The RPD noted that the Principal Appellant had later admitted on questioning that he had no evidence in relation to this claim, and that when specifically asked why he had not at least updated his Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative to mention these facts, he said only that he had approached his brother-in-law for a document to this effect, but had been refused. The RPD held that the Principal Appellant did not answer its questions, and ultimately found that in this claim about the brother-in-law the Principal Appellant was embellishing to exaggerate the allegations, and that had this party been approached and asked about the Appellants' whereabouts, this pertinent information would have been added to the BOC narrative. To this end, it also noted that the Appellants were represented by counsel. The RPD ultimately held that these findings undermined the allegations that the Cartel had approached their family to try and locate the Appellants and further held that, on a balance of probabilities, the Cartel had not done so or otherwise come looking for them.15\n[17] Upon appeal, the Appellants argue that the RPD erred in these findings, baldly stating that they had not embellished the claim, and asserting that in rejecting their testimony that they had no evidence of this claim, the RPD had been over-vigilant and microscopic in its examination and had unfairly held a lack of details against the Appellants.\n[18] I disagree. With respect, the response of the Appellants in this regard seems to miss, or at least leave unaddressed, the RPD's central point. The issue is that this assertion about the brother-in-law having been approached seeking their whereabouts appears to have been a late evolution in the testimony of the Principal Appellant, as it was not originally documented or stated but rather arose only later in the hearing, when the topic of how the Appellants could be found by the persecutors was broached. In addition, when questioned, the Principal Appellant was also able to give no explanation for why this information had not been included in his BOC. The Principal Appellant's response, as to this, was that when he approached his brother-in-law for proof of his having been approached, this family member had refused to talk about it.16 That may well be, but it does not, in any way, explain why the Appellants would not at least have updated their narrative to mention that any of this had happened. I further note that, at the outset of the hearing, the Appellants specifically confirmed that their BOC narrative was correct and complete,17 and I also note that they were represented by counsel throughout their proceedings.\n[19] In short, I note that upon appeal, counsel for Appellants does not address or provide any explanation in respect of the evolution of their evidence to add mention of the Cartel recently approaching the brother-in-law, or in relation to the material omission of this information in their BOC materials. For these reasons, I do not find that the RPD erred in finding that the evidence of the Appellants evolved, and I agree that in doing this, they were embellishing to bolster their refugee claim by adding a claim that the Cartel had recently approached their family in an attempt to find them. I, too, find this allegation to be lacking in credibility.\n[20] I also note that in its decision, the RPD held that it assumed, without deciding, that the Appellants were targeted by the CJNG, despite that certain of the Appellants' supporting documents, including the Mexican police report, failed to specifically identify the extortionists as being with the CJNG. While, upon appeal, the Appellants state that this is a reviewable error, in my view this statement of concern by the RPD appears to be mere Obiter, given that the RPD declares that it ultimately assumes that CJNG was the organization involved. In any event, to be clear, I am prepared to accept that the Appellants' alleged agent of persecution was the CJNG, based upon their testimony and the account in the BOC narrative.\nTHE RPD DID NOT ERR IN FINDING THAT THE APPELLANTS HAVE A VIABLE IFA\nThe determinative issue is IFA\n[21] While the RPD drew a negative credibility inference in relation to the Principal Appellant's claim that his brother-in-law had been approached by the Cartel in an effort to locate the Appellants, the RPD nonetheless essentially accepted as credible the Appellants' other allegations and concluded that IFA was the determinative issue. As such, the determinative issue in this appeal is whether the Appellants have a viable IFA.\nIFA Background and legal standard\n[22] The rationale underlying the international refugee protection system is that national protection takes precedence over international protection. International protection is intended to be \"surrogate\" or \"substitute\" protection which will only come into play in certain situations where national protection is unavailable. The onus is on a claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they do not have a viable IFA in their own country.\n[23] In short, an internal flight alternative means that there is another city or area in Mexico where an appellant can live safely. If there is an IFA, then the appellant does not need to seek refuge or safety in Canada. As a result, his claim for refugee protection would be denied.\n[24] There is a two-part test to determine if there is an IFA,18 which requires that the IFA must be safe, and it must be reasonable. It is safe if there is no serious possibility of persecution or risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or torture. It is reasonable if conditions in the IFA are not unduly harsh and do not jeopardize the life or safety of the appellant.\n[25] In determining safety, the agent of persecution's interest in and ability to find the appellant is considered. The appellant's circumstances and the general circumstances in the proposed IFAs are also considered.\n[26] In determining reasonableness, the appellant's personal context and situation are considered, including factors such as language, religion, ethnicity, education, and their ability to earn a living. Establishing unreasonableness requires the existence of conditions in the IFA which would be unduly harsh to the point of jeopardizing the life or safety of the appellant.19 Of note, an appellant must show actual concrete evidence of such conditions. One's belief that they will be in jeopardy is not sufficient to establish unreasonableness. Once the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) proposes a specific IFA, the onus or burden is on the appellant to establish that the proposed IFA is not safe and reasonable. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option.20\n[27] The RPD proposed the cities of Merida and Campeche as potential IFA locations at the hearing and questioned the Appellants accordingly. It settled on Merida as the IFA location in its decision.\nFirst prong of the IFA test: the means and motivation of the Cartel to locate the Appellants throughout Mexico\nMeans or operational capacity of the Cartel to pursue the Appellants\n[28] In its decision, the RPD states that in assessing whether the Cartel possessed the means to locate the Appellants in Merida, it had considered the size and population of Mexico, the distance to Merida,21 as well as the area of operation of the Cartel22 and noted objective evidence indicating that the CJNG does not have a presence in the proposed IFA. It also noted other objective information indicating that a motivated Cartel would likely possess the ability to track targets throughout the country.23 Ultimately however, the RPD did not come to a definitive conclusion on the question of whether the Cartel had the means to locate the Appellants, but instead noted that it had found that there was no evidence that the Cartel was motivated to pursue the Appellants.24\n[29] Upon appeal, the Appellants argue that the RPD erred in evaluating the means of the Cartel to locate them, stating that it disregarded contrary objective evidence that establishes that strongly motivated cartels have the ability to track targets nationwide by using spyware, family networks, property records, suborned telephone company personnel and other corrupt officials, and that the new evidence articles that it has submitted to the RAD establish that the Cartel is now in the proposed IFA location.25\n[30] Upon my own review of the record, I find that objective evidence clearly establishes that the extensive reach of the CJNG extends into the Yucatan and Merida. I have considered the most recent National Documentation Package (NDP), in accordance with the IRB's Policy on National Documentation Packages in Refugee Determination Proceedings.26 Recent information in the IRB's NDP for Mexico establishes that the CJNG is a powerful and violent cartel with a presence, through its extensive alliances and smaller cells, in all 32 Mexican states.27 I also note that the Appellants' articles, which have been accepted as new evidence as noted above, specifically state that the Cartel is now present in Merida. However, even beyond this, it is notable that a recent Response to Information Request (RIR) in the Mexico NDP also specifically set out that sources have declared that a number of criminal groups, including the CJNG, were now established in Merida.28 I also note that the objective evidence asserts that the CJNG \"has expanded rapidly, and the CJNG now has some sort of presence in every part of Mexico, except Sinaloa and the Golden Triangle of heroin production.\"29\n[31] Indeed, the NDP further indicates that the CJNG has the \"most operational capacity\" in the country and is one of the only cartels with a national presence, along with the Sinaloa Cartel, noting also that the CJNG has a \"'supranational' presence through its own presence or through allies 'in most of the country's states.'\"30 The United States Drug Enforcement Administration describes the CJNG as Mexico's most well-armed drug trafficking organization,31 and the objective evidence highlights the Cartel's use of sophisticated weapons to assassinate targets.32\n[32] In short, the objective evidence in the NDP illustrates that Yucatan, where Merida is located, is part of the CJNG's area of considerable influence.33 Objective evidence is also clear in its stark declaration that if any of the major criminal \"organizations is interested in harming [an individual], no city will provide a safe haven. Any of these organizations have the capacity to commit violent acts against any person in the country.\"34 It specifically reports that \"if organized crime groups in other parts of Mexico are 'interested and willing to retaliate against people located in [Merida, Campeche, Cabo San Lucas, or Mexico City], they could do it easily.\"35 [emphasis mine]\n[33] I also note that, other than the new evidence articles, all of these documents were present in the NDP in effect at the time of the RPD's hearing in this matter. While the RPD did not make a definitive finding with respect to the means or operational capacity of the Cartel to locate the Appellants throughout Mexico, I hold that the objective evidence establishes that the CJNG has a presence throughout Mexico and would have the means to locate and harm the Appellants throughout the country, including the proposed IFA location, if it were minded to do so.\nThe motivation of the Cartel to pursue and harm the Appellants\n[34] Turning to the motivation of the Cartel to track and harm the Appellants, I note that the RPD found that they had failed to establish that the Cartel has the motivation to utilize its resources to locate and harm them in the proposed IFA, regardless of whether it has the capacity to do so.36 In coming to this conclusion, the RPD noted that little evidence had been provided to suggest that the Cartel would pursue the Appellants to the IFA location. It had rejected the credibility of the Appellants' late claim that the brother-in-law had been approached in an effort to determine their whereabouts. The RPD also pointed out that no evidence had been adduced indicating that they continue to be persons of interest to the Cartel, and that in the Appellants' telling, other than receiving two phone calls in XXXX 2019, there had been no contact from the Cartel after the initial extortion threats. It found that the Appellants had also not established that they had the profile of the type of persons whom the Cartel would be interested in locating or harming, should they go to the proposed IFA.37 The RPD ultimately found that there was no persuasive evidence that the Cartel would have the motivation to find them in the proposed IFA, and that the evidence instead indicated that it was not motivated to do so.38\n[35] Upon appeal, the Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its motivation finding. They state that the RPD failed to realize that \"by refusing to pay high extortion amounts, the Appellant's [sic] automatically became targets for persecution\"39 as cartels have been known to track individuals for reasons such as personal vengeance, loss of money and reporting them to the police. They also essentially accuse the RPD of unfairly speculating with respect to the issue of the Cartel's motivation, asserting that the RPD erred in speculating that the CJNG had no motivation to pursue the Appellants, and protesting that no one knows what is in the mind of the agents of persecution.40\n[36] I do not find these arguments persuasive. First, I disagree with the Appellants' contention that it should be accepted that as they had allegedly failed to pay the extortion, they had \"automatically\" become targets for persecution. To the contrary, the very same objective evidence earlier quoted by the Appellants clearly states the opposite: that \"it is an oversimplification to say that a [Cartel] will track just anyone\", and rather that only high ranking, rather than low ranking targets, warranted the expenditure of resources necessary to track them throughout the country.41\n[37] Second, I note that in her argument about speculation, it seems that counsel for the Appellants is functionally reversing the onus before the IRB: it is the Appellants who must establish their factual claims in evidence, on a balance of probabilities standard; it is not the RPD which must introduce evidence that disproves the claim. It would appear that this is essentially what the Appellants are calling for in their argument about RPD speculation. In any event, I do not find that the RPD somehow unfairly speculated that the Cartel was not pursuing the Appellants, or that it erred by doing so. The RPD considered the evidence before it, and appropriately concluded that this evidence did not indicate that the Cartel had been, or was motivated to, pursue the Appellants.\n[38] Nor is it sufficient for the Appellants to baldly assert that no one knows what is in the mind of the agent of persecution. While this is clearly true, that fact does not provide evidence that the Appellants are currently being pursued or continually targeted, and the onus remains on the Appellants to provide evidence in support of these claims. I find that the Appellants have not provided any corroborative evidence indicating that this is the case. I further note that while the Appellants effectively assert that the RPD disregarded their claim in failing to recognize that there was a vendetta against the Principal Appellant by the Cartel, in my view it is clear that this claim and testimony were not ignored or disregarded by the RPD, as is insinuated. Rather, though that testimony was considered by the RPD, it was found not to be sufficient to establish the allegations, in light of the contrary evidence.\n[39] While the Appellants have now baldly stated that it is their belief that there is a vendetta against them by the Cartel, this does not constitute evidence of that claim. The Federal Court has held that despite the presumption of truthfulness of its claimants, the Board is not required to accept as objectively true what the Appellants believe to be true.42 Further, the evidence put forward by the Appellants in this matter gives no indication that they are being pursued, and rather would seem to indicate that they are not, given the paucity of attempts to contact or reach the Appellants while they were in Mexico and that their claim that the brother-in-law was approached has been found not to be credible. Incidentally, I note that even if this claim had been accepted, the testimony of the Principal Appellant was also that his brother-in-law had then been extorted in relation to the XXXX XXXX, which he had purchased from the Principal Appellant. If believed or accepted, this would indicate that the Cartel had ultimately been successful in securing the extortion money they sought with respect to the XXXX XXXX, which would seem to indicate that it would have even less incentive to pursue the Appellants, since it actually obtained the money it had wanted.\n[40] With respect to the motivation of the Cartel to pursue the Appellants, I additionally note that I agree with the RPD's finding that the Appellants did not establish that they possess a profile such that the Cartel would be likely to expend the time and resources to have them located and harmed anywhere in Mexico. They also did not give evidence of high-level or charged personal interactions with the Cartel. Indeed, in the telling of the Principal Appellant, beyond the initial attempts to extort him, it would appear that the only other interactions they ever had with the Cartel were two telephone calls in XXXX 2019.\n[41] Finally, it must be understood that it is the responsibility of the Appellants to establish through the evidence provided that, on a balance of probabilities, the Cartel would be motivated to pursue them into the proposed IFA. It is not enough for the Appellants to merely say, as has been done here,43 that there is objective evidence that generally indicates that some criminal groups may track certain individuals as a result of a personal vendetta or money owed, and then blithely state that they face such a vendetta, when there is no evidence to speak of that supports that contention. Instead, they must provide evidence indicating why this is likely, or otherwise argue why the circumstances at bar would lead to that conclusion. No such evidence or reasonable arguments have been made in this matter and, as noted, the evidence provided appears to indicate the opposite. I find that the Appellants have simply not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Cartel has the motivation to pursue them into the proposed IFA.\n[42] In short, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Cartel has neither the motivation nor interest to pursue the Appellants throughout Mexico or in the proposed IFA, regardless of its capacity to do so. I accordingly find that this location is safe for the Appellants.\nThe second prong of the IFA test: reasonableness of the IFA locations\n[43] In its Decision, the RPD held that the proposed IFA was reasonable, upon consideration of the Principal and Associate Appellant's circumstances in relation to their language skills and work experience. It noted that, upon questioning, the Principal Appellant had stated only that Merida was not safe, saying he knew of other people in Canada who had fled from Merida because they had experienced problems with other criminal groups in that area.44 The RPD identified that there is a high threshold for establishing that an IFA is unreasonable under the governing caselaw, and ultimately concluded that it would not be unreasonable in the Appellants' circumstances for them to relocate to the proposed IFA.45\n[44] I note that with respect to the reasonableness of the proposed IFA, upon appeal, the Appellants argue that \"The Panel's arguments against the statements that they speak the language (Spanish) does not play a role into the Appellant's ability to find employment which is a far reality to what the current unemployment rates show on the NDP.\"46 With respect, it is not entirely clear what counsel for the Appellants is arguing here, but, in any event, it is simply incorrect to claim that the RPD asserted that their ability to speak Spanish does not play a role in their ability to secure employment. In fact, the RPD stated the opposite of this in its decision. In any event, I note that it is not the role of the RAD to attempt to divine or particularize the unspecified arguments of the Appellants, and I will not do so here.\n[45] I also note that the Appellants argue that in relation to the articles submitted before the RAD, this \"new evidence would define this proof of adverse conditions, as the presence of not only the CJNG, but other cartels would jeopardize the life and safety of the Appellants.\"47 With respect, I again must disagree, as it is in no way clear why this information would lead to the conclusion that conditions in that city should be held to jeopardize the Appellants' life and safety. The general fact that there is organized crime in the proposed IFA locations cannot simply be proclaimed to establish such a danger to the Appellants, and I do not find this to be the case, on a balance of probabilities. I also note that by this logic, the IFA location would not be safe for anyone at all to reside in, as the presence of cartels and some level of organized crime should likewise be held to jeopardize the life and safety of every resident of that city. That surely cannot be a reasonable conclusion to draw, even if there is a Cartel presence in Merida.\n[46] Finally, I note that, in testimony, the Principal Appellant had conceded that they could live elsewhere in the country and had further stated that the true impediment to their doing this and going elsewhere was fear of the Cartel and crime.48 I acknowledge that there could well be some difficulties and inconveniences for the Appellants in relocating to the proposed IFA location. I am also certainly alive to their concerns and reluctance in relation to relocating. However, as has been noted, a very high threshold exists for the unreasonableness portion of the IFA test. According to the Federal Court, it \"requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\"49 Furthermore, it requires \"actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\"50\n[47] I do not find that the Appellants have provided actual and concrete evidence of any conditions that would jeopardize their life and safety if they were to relocate to Merida. Consequently, I find that the Appellants have not established that such a relocation would be unreasonable in the circumstances or that they lack a viable IFA within Mexico.\nCONCLUSION\n[48] For these reasons, and based upon my own analysis of the record, the appeal is dismissed. In accordance with subsection 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, I confirm the Decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection within the meaning of section 96 and subsection 97 of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nD.

The PA indicated that he would think about it. He was threatened with torture and murder if he did not comply.\n* The Associate Appellant (AA) was the victim of an attempted abduction on XXXX XXXX, 2017. Shortly afterwards, the PA received an anonymous phone call in which the caller threatened the AA's life.\n* The Appellants traveled to Canada in XXXX 2017 and returned to Mexico five months later, in XXXX 2018. They lived with the AA's parents.\n* On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the PA was hit by a vehicle while riding his motorcycle. He was abducted at gunpoint, blindfolded, and put into the vehicle, where he was beaten and threatened by assailants, among them \"K.\" The PA's father received a phone call demanding XXXX pesos per month or the PA would be killed. His captors released him in a rural area, where he was discovered by a local resident. The PA's father picked him up and took him to a medical clinic, where he received treatment.\n* The Appellants returned to Canada in XXXX 2018 and claimed refugee protection in or around August 2020.\n* The PA's father received threatening phone calls on the PA's phone after his departure.\n[4] The Appellants were unrepresented during the RPD proceeding, and are unrepresented in their appeal to the RAD.\n[5] The Minister of IRCC intervened in the RPD proceeding on the basis of credibility, by filing of documents only.\n[6] The determinative issues for the RPD were credibility, and an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in the city of Merida, Yucatan, or Campeche, Campeche.\n[7] Overall, the RPD found that the PA's testimony was not credible, due to omissions and contradictions in his testimony and evidence that he could not credibly explain. As the AA relied on the PA's allegations and testimony for her claim, the RPD found that these negative credibility findings extended to her claim. Notwithstanding this, the RPD accepted the AA's testimony about her abduction attempt in XXXX 2017.\n[8] In the alternative, and after accepting the AA's testimony about her abduction attempt, the RPD found that the Appellants had a viable IFA in Mexico, with respect to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). The RPD found that even if the evidence establishes that the agents of harm have the means to pursue them to the IFA, the Appellants failed to show that they possess the motivation. The RPD found that the Appellants failed to establish that the IFA would be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances.\n[9] The Appellants argue that the RPD's decision should be set aside because the CJNG are present everywhere in Mexico, including the IFA location, and they have both the means and the motivation to find and harm them. They also submit that the RPD should have accepted the PA's testimony as credible under the circumstances.\n[10] I find that there were significant credibility issues in the PA's testimony. Although I do not agree with or rely on all of the RPD's negative credibility findings, I find that the RPD was correct to determine that the PA's allegation that he was abducted by on XXXX XXXX, 2018, was not credible. Nor do I accept as credible the PA's allegations about subsequent events arising from this alleged abduction. I accept the Appellants' testimony about events that occurred in XXXX 2017.\n[11] I find that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Merida, Yucatan. The RPD Decision is correct.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[12] Subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)2 states that an appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection. It is for the appellant to provide full and detailed submissions in their memorandum about how any proposed new evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) and how that evidence relates to them.\n[13] If the new evidence meets the requirements in subsection 110(4), then the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) must also apply the adapted Raza factors endorsed in Singh. In Singh, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the RAD should assess the admissibility of the new evidence for its credibility, relevance, and newness.3\n[14] The list of new evidence submitted with the appeal is as follows:\na) Declaration of XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.4\nb) Declaration of XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.5\nc) Declaration of XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 20236.\nd) Declaration of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.7\ne) Declaration of XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022.8\nf) Declaration of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.9\ng) Declaration of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.10\nh) Death Certificate of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, registration date XXXX XXXX, 2021. 11\ni) Affidavit 2nd CAPTAIN XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2023.12\nj) Affidavit 1st OFFICER XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022.13\nk) News Article: \"Curious dogs unearth body of missing boy, in Morelos\", El Grafico, dated March 6, 2019.14\nl) News Article: \"Man shot dead in Jiutepec\", diariodemorelos.com, dated August 19, 2022.15\nm) News Article: \"The drug empire: the CJNG only needs 4 states to dominate all of Mexico.\" Infobae, dated August 3, 2022.16\nn) News Article: \"Drug map in Mexico: where the main cartels operate,according to the US Congress\", infobae, dated June 16, 2022.17\no) Six photos (one dated XXXX XXXX, 2014, other undated).18\np) Medical Report XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX 2023.19\nThe following evidence is accepted\nAffidavit of military officer and affidavit of police officer (items i) and j))\n[15] I find that these affidavits meet the requirements of subsection 110(4). On their surface they contain contemporary information about the operations of the CJNG in Mexico and are relevant to the issue of IFA since they discuss the capabilities of the cartel with respect to tracking their targets. I have no reason to question their credibility or provenance.\n[16] Therefore, I admit these documents.\nThe remaining evidence is rejected\nDeclarations of Appellants (items a) and c))\n[17] The Appellants have each responded to the RPD's findings by providing a written declaration. The declarations repeat some of their principal allegations and include explanations and submissions concerning the alleged errors in the RPD Decision. The content of these declarations does not constitute new evidence under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and should be considered part of the Appeal Memorandum as required by the RAD Rules.20 Notwithstanding this procedural oversight by the Appellants, I have taken into consideration these declarations as submissions in considering the Appellants' arguments on appeal.\nDeclaration of Principal Appellant's father (item b))\n[18] I find that this written statement by the PA's father does not meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. Although it is dated after the Appellants' rejection by the RPD, it exclusively concerns events central to their claim which took place before the RPD Decision. The Appellants have not demonstrated that this evidence was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it at the time of the rejection.\n[19] The PA's father previously provided a declaration for the RPD proceeding. The new declaration addresses inconsistencies and omissions raised by the RPD during the hearing with respect to his previous letter, and the allegations mentioned therein. For example, the author corrects his previous declaration by stating that the cartel increased their monthly extortion amounts that they demanded from him, in line with the PA's testimony. The declaration also provides new information about threats that the PA's father allegedly received at the time, which was not provided by the Appellants. For example, he writes that he had to move to another property and was forced to stop his business operations because of the threats he received.\n[20] This information is clearly relevant to the Appellants' claim, and the Appellants have not provided a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide it at the time of their rejection by the RPD. The only explanation provided by the author is that he did not tell the PA about the increasing extortion amounts because he was concerned about his \"emotional health.\" I find that this explanation is not credible. The PA's father wrote a detailed letter of support for the RPD proceeding and was instrumental in the Appellants' efforts to escape harm in Mexico. It simply cannot be believed that he would withhold details from his original letter addressed to the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) that would support a positive outcome of their claim. There is no question that the PA's father is concerned about his son's health and well-being, and I find that this would reasonably entail providing the strongest possible letter of support. Despite allegedly keeping important information from the PA, there is no indication in the PA's father's original letter that he possessed other relevant details or could be contacted by the Board for additional information. No contact information was provided on his original letter. Also, the PA knew about the alleged escalating extortion from the cartel, and yet he testified that he did not ask his father to amend his letter or provide an update. No explanation has been provided for the failure of the PA's father to communicate other important facts that arose before the RPD rejection. Overall, I find that this more likely represents an attempt to 'fix' the credibility or other issues in the PA's testimony on appeal.\n[21] Therefore, I do not admit this evidence.\nDeclarations from friends (items d) through g))\n[22] I find that these written declarations from various friends and\/or acquaintances of the PA do not meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. Although they are dated after the Appellants' rejection by the RPD, they concern events which took place before the RPD Decision. For the most part, the declarations repeat some of the Appellants' allegations or refer to other events that occurred prior to the RPD Decision. The Appellants have not demonstrated that this evidence was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it at the time of the rejection.\n[23] In some cases, it is unclear exactly when an event recounted in these documents took place, such the funeral of a mutual acquaintance of the PA's who worked for the CJNG and was killed by them in XXXX 2022 (item e)) or the closure of a friend's business because of extortion and threats from the CJNG (item f)). The declaration from a former \"federal legislator\" (item g)) also includes a general sentence about the heightened power and connections of \"K\" \"nowadays.\"21\n[24] As already noted, it is for the Appellants to provide full and detailed submissions about how the evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4). They have not clearly demonstrated that this information arose after the rejection of their claim. Nor have they demonstrated or provided any explanation why this evidence was not reasonably available, or why they could not reasonably have provided this evidence before the RPD Decision.\n[25] Moreover, even if I were to accept that the above information arose after the rejection of the Appellants' claim, the Appellants have not demonstrated that it is sufficiently relevant or new to be admitted into evidence. It is not clear that these other friends, acquaintances, or contacts are similarly situated persons, or that the information is probative with respect to the determinative issues in the claim, namely credibility, and the motivation of the CJNG to pursue the Appellants to the IFA.\n[26] Therefore, I do not admit this evidence.\nDeath Certificate (item h))\n[27] I find that the death certificate of the AA's mother does not meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. The document is dated XXXX XXXX, 2021. The Appellants allege that the illness of the AA's mother is one of the reasons they returned to Mexico in 2018. The Appellants have not demonstrated that this evidence arose after their rejection, that it was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it at the time of the rejection.\n[28] Moreover, I find that that this document is not sufficiently relevant or new to be admissible. I accept the death of the AA's mother. This fact was not questioned by the RPD. Even if I admitted the document, it would be incapable of proving and disproving any facts that are relevant to the outcome of the claim. I do not rely on the RPD's negative finding with respect to re-availment.\n[29] Therefore, I do not admit his evidence.\nNews articles (items l) through n))\n[30] These news articles concern the CJNG and crimes allegedly committed by the cartel, matters that go to the core of the Appellants' claim. The articles pre-date the RPD Decision by several months to years. The Appellants have not provided any explanation or demonstrated that this evidence arose after their rejection, that it was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it at the time of the rejection.\n[31] I note that the RPD informally allowed the PA to present other internet news articles during the RPD hearing, even though they did not comply with the RPD Rules for disclosure and use of documents. Notwithstanding this, the Appellants did not provide this evidence at the time of the RPD Decision.\n[32] Therefore, I do not admit this evidence.\nPhotos (item o)\n[33] These photos are undated, except for one photo, which is from 2014. The remaining photos appear to pre-date the RPD rejection, since they purportedly show two individuals who died before the RPD rejection. No explanation has been provided for the photos, and the Appellants have not demonstrated that this evidence arose after their rejection, that it was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it at the time of the rejection.\n[34] I find that even if I were to admit these photos, they would not have any probative value with respect to the determinative issues in this claim. At best they are proof of a social connection between the Appellants and other victims of the CJNG who are not clearly similarly situated persons.\n[35] Therefore, I do not admit these photos.\nMedical report and letter (item p)\n[36] This document is purportedly a corrected medical report for the PA issued by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX medical clinic describing his symptoms and treatment following his admission to the clinic after his abduction on XXXX XXXX, 2018. It is accompanied by a covering letter by the doctor who issued the corrected medical report. Both documents are dated XXXX XXXX, 2023.\n[37] I find that this document does not meet the requirements of subsection 110(4). Although I accept that this document appears to have arisen after the rejection of the Appellants' claim, I find that it is not sufficiently credible or trustworthy to be admissible.22\n[38] The jurisprudence supports that suspicious and fortuitous timing with respect to new evidence may, in limited circumstances, support a finding that it is not credible or trustworthy.23\n[39] Firstly, I find that it is an extraordinary coincidence that the PA has provided a medical report on appeal to the RAD that fixes all the inconsistencies and omissions in the original document identified by the RPD in its decision. I note the original medical report was issued nearly two years before the RPD hearing, and that the PA demonstrated that he was knowledgeable of the contents of this document.24 There is no indication that he sought to have the document corrected until after the RPD's negative decision which enumerates the discrepancies between his testimony and supporting documentation.\n[40] Secondly, even though the new medical report is purportedly a true record of what occurred, it is still inconsistent with the PA's testimony. The document states that the PA was \"assessed and discharged from the hospital after 12 hours\" however the PA testified that he attended a medical clinic (never a hospital) and that he was there for a total of 5 or 6 hours.25 There is no indication in the PA's BOC or testimony that he was kept overnight, and released the next day, as the new medical report states.\n[41] Thirdly, the explanation in the covering letter for the inaccuracies in the original document, conflicts with the content of the original medical report. The letter states that \"the on-call physician did not have access to the patient's record because he was only covering my shift and my duties due to a health problem affecting me at the time. The physician in charge provided a medical prescription which contained information that was collected from the oral testimony of healthcare staff assisting the patient.\"26 However, the original medical report is purportedly certified by another medical doctor from the clinic on the basis of \"the content of the clinical file.\" The report is signed by the authoring doctor and bears the stamp of the medical clinic. It is not a prescription but a detailed medical report describing the details of PA's symptoms and treatment.\n[42] Moreover, the PA testified that his father took him to a medical clinic that he \"trusts\" where a friend of his works as a doctor and often treats their family members.27 Although the PA was questioned in detail by the RPD about his medical treatment at the clinic and the medical report, he never indicated that he was treated by another physician who was not knowledgeable of his clinical file, as the covering letter suggests. As the PA visited this medical clinic in particular because of access to a doctor who was a trusted family friend, he would likely know if that preferred doctor was unavailable.\n[43] For these reasons, I find that these documents are not sufficiently credible or trustworthy to be admissible, and I do not admit them.\nSummary of new evidence findings\n[44] The Federal Court has reiterated that \"[a] RAD appeal is not a second chance to submit evidence to answer weaknesses identified by the RPD.\"28 For the most part, the Appellants have attempted to reinforce their claim by disclosing evidence on appeal that arose before the RPD Decision, and which they reasonably could and should have provided at the time of their rejection. Otherwise, the Appellants have provided evidence that is not sufficiently credible or trustworthy, such as the updated medical report, which appears designed to 'fix' credibility or other issues identified by the RPD in its decision.\n[45] The Appellants argue that their new evidence should be admitted because they were not expecting their claim to be rejected. This is not a valid reason for accepting documents under subsection 110(4). The onus is on the claimants to prove their claim and provide the RPD with acceptable documents establishing the elements of their claim.29\n[46] I note that the Appellants do not have legal representation on appeal, however I find that this alone is not a sufficient reason to admit the above documents. There is no discretion to waive the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\nORAL HEARING\n[47] The Appellants have not requested an oral hearing. My jurisdiction to hold an oral hearing is limited to situations where admissible new evidence raises a serious issue of credibility; is central to the decision; and determinative of the claim.30\n[48] The only admissible new evidence in this claim, the affidavits of a military and police officer, do not raise a serious issue of credibility, and are not determinative of the claim.\n[49] For these reasons, I will not hold an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[50] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision after conducting an independent assessment.31\n[51] The determinative issues in this appeal are credibility and an IFA in Merida, Yucatan.\n[52] I note that the RPD conducted the hearing in a manner that was fair and considerate of the fact that the Appellants were unrepresented. At the beginning of the hearing, the RPD Panel explained the process and test to be met in detail, using plain language. The Panel exercised flexibility in considering evidence from the Appellants, allowing late disclosure of documents. The Appellants have not raised any issues on appeal that suggest that there was a violation of procedural fairness or natural justice in hearing their claim.\nThe claim does not have a nexus to the Refugee Convention\n[53] The RPD found that the Appellants were not targeted on the basis of any of the five Convention grounds. It determined that they were victims of crime. Therefore, the RPD concluded that the Appellant did not have a have a nexus to a Convention ground, and that he was not a Convention refugee. Accordingly, the RPD examined the claim under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA only.\n[54] The Appellants do not contest this finding.\n[55] I agree with the RPD. Persecution must be distinguished from being a victim of a criminal act or a personal vendetta, which is the scenario in this case. There is no evidence that the Appellants were targeted by any of the agents of harm because of a Convention ground. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant are not Convention refugees. The RPD was correct to assess the claim solely under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nThere is insufficient credible evidence that the Appellants were targeted by the agents of harm after XXXX 2017\n[56] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.32 However, this presumption is not unchallengeable and may be rebutted by the claimant's lack of credibility.33\n[57] The RPD found that there were inconsistencies and omissions in the PA's testimony and evidence concerning his alleged abduction on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and that the Appellants did not have a reasonable explanation for returning from Canada to the same city in Mexico in XXXX 2018\nwhere they had allegedly been targeted by the CJNG as 'military targets'. Overall, the RPD found the PA \"not credible as to what occurred in Mexico\"34 though it accepted that the AA was targeted and assaulted in XXXX 2017.\n[58] While the Board may make a general finding of a lack of credibility, where a claimant is \"...so lacking in credibility that it concludes that there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim.\"35 I find that the RPD's general finding of a lack of credibility is not sufficiently transparent or intelligible in this case.\n[59] However, for the following reasons, I find that the RPD was correct to determine that the PA's allegation about his abduction was not credible. Although the RPD was not justified in making an overall finding of a lack of credibility on this basis, I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish that the Appellants (or their family members) were targeted by the CJNG after XXXX 2017.\n[60] The PA testified that after he was hit by a vehicle on XXXX XXXX, 2018, he was abducted and taken to what he believes was a CJNG \"safe house\" for two days. I agree with the RPD that the PA failed to mention in his BOC that he heard other people being tortured and begging to be released in other rooms. The RPD was correct to reject the PA's explanation that he wanted to keep his narrative brief, noting that his narrative is six pages, and that he would not reasonably fail to mention the material fact that he was kept in a cartel \"safe house\" with other persons who were also being tortured.\n[61] In my independent assessment, there are additional material inconsistencies between the PA's testimony and his BOC with respect to his abduction. For example, the PA states in his BOC that he recognized the voice of \"K\" (the alleged principal agent of harm) who entered the van after he was abducted and threatened him. However, he gave no indication during his oral testimony that \"K\" was among the persons who were in the vehicle with him, or that he recognized any voices until after he was in the house.36 All in all, the PA provided a significantly different picture of his abduction and detention during oral testimony compared to his detailed BOC narrative.\n[62] The PA testified that after his release by the CJNG, the cartel continued to call his father and made escalating demands for monthly payment up to XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos to avoid further harm to the PA. However, this is inconsistent with the letter from the PA's father, which merely states that the cartel asked him to pay XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos per month. When the RPD put this to the PA, he explained that he had no idea why his father would provide different information.\n[63] In my independent assessment, the more significant inconsistency is between the PA's BOC narrative, which gives no indication that the extortion amount increased from XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos despite mentioning the repeated calls to his father, and his testimony, as summarized above. I find that this is a material inconsistency or omission, since the PA's testimony suggests that the demands and interest from the cartel was increasing over time, and that he considered this to be a sign of how motivated the agents of harm were to target him.37 If this is true, the PA should reasonably have included this important detail in his BOC narrative.\n[64] The PA provided a medical report from the clinic where he allegedly received treatment following his release from his captors. The report states that the PA was admitted and released on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. It also states that PA's injuries included a wound caused by a canine, and that the PA was given a rabies shot as part of his treatment. However, as the RPD correctly noted, this does not match the PA's account of this incident. The PA testified that he was released by the CJNG the following day, on XXXX XXXX, 2018. He alleges that he was treated for numerous cigarette burns, which are not mentioned in the report, and he never indicated that a dog was involved in his assault. When the RPD put this to the PA, he replied that the report contains mistakes and that it was written two years after the incident. The RPD was correct to reject this explanation on the grounds that it was purportedly signed by a doctor who certified the content of the clinical file. Moreover, as noted in the new evidence section, the PA was aware of the contents of this report, which was issued roughly two years before the RPD hearing, and yet there is no evidence that he attempted to have it corrected until after he was rejected by the RPD. Therefore, the RPD correctly determined that either the report is fraudulent, or the injury in question did not happen in the manner or for the reasons alleged by the PA. Either way, the PA's credibility is diminished with respect to his allegation of being abducted.\n[65] Furthermore, there is an additional inconsistency between the PA's testimony and his BOC narrative. The PA testified that the same day he was receiving medical treatment at the clinic, the agents of harm got in touch with his father to demand monthly extortion payments.38 However, his BOC narrative states that this happened later, in the \"following days.\"\n[66] Although the RPD did not refer in its reasons to some of these credibility concerns, I find that this does not constitute a \"new issue\" as per Ching.39 While the relevant case law on this matter is mixed, I find that there is support for my position that this is not a new issue.\n[67] I note that there is not an issue of procedural fairness when the RAD finds an additional basis to question the applicant's credibility using the evidentiary record before the RPD.40 The RAD can make independent credibility findings, without putting them to the applicant and giving him an opportunity to make submissions; and the RAD may independently assess the documentary evidence or make credibility findings.41\n[68] The RPD identified credibility as an issue at the beginning of the RPD hearing, and it remained a live issue throughout the proceeding. The Appellants have put credibility squarely in issue on appeal, arguing that the RPD erred by finding that the PA's oral testimony was not credible.\n[69] Numerous other cases stand for the proposition that the RAD may make further findings on credibility, which was at issue before the RPD, and that arise from the evidentiary record where the Appellant's credibility raised as a ground of appeal.42\n[70] I find that this case should be distinguished from Abraha v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 100, where the Court found that the RAD breached procedural fairness by failing to give the Appellants an opportunity to respond to its concerns. In Abraha, the RAD made new and distinct negative credibility findings on several documents that were before the RPD. However, the RPD did not consider these documents as part of its credibility analysis, or in most cases, even refer to the documents. It did not question the claimant about some of the documents that the RAD subsequently found to be inauthentic. That is not the case here. The RPD questioned the PA in detail about his alleged abduction and his supporting evidence, including his purported medical report. The principal credibility issues that led to my negative finding were put to the Appellants during the RPD hearing.\n[71] The Appellants have not specifically contested any of the RPD's credibility findings. They submit that the PA was unable to express himself well or correctly during the hearing, which may have led to a misunderstanding. The PA states that he was very nervous and did not know how to deal with the situation.\n[72] I understand that the RPD hearing is a stressful environment and accept that the Appellants were nervous. I also acknowledge that the Appellants were self-represented during the RPD proceeding. However, I find that this does not satisfactorily explain the numerous significant inconsistencies and omissions in the PA's testimony and evidence about events that are at the core of the claim and which he himself experienced. As already noted, I find that the RPD conducted the hearing in a fair and considerate manner. The RPD acknowledged that persons who have experienced trauma may have difficulties in presenting their case and recalling details and events. However, the RPD correctly determined that the Appellants did not appear to have any difficulties recalling details or events during the oral hearing. The Appellants are relatively well-educated. No supporting medical or psychological evidence has been provided that would account for the issues in the PA's testimony. There is no evidence of interpretation issues during the RPD hearing.\n[73] The Appellants also submit that the PA's narrative was written \"much time after the events\" with the help of AA and his parents, and that when he wrote his narrative it was only about events that happened to himself, not others.43\n[74] I do not accept these arguments. It is unclear why this would lead to inconsistencies and omissions in relation to the PA's testimony. Moreover, the Appellants affirmed that their BOC forms were complete, true, and correct at the time of signing them, and at the RPD hearing. It is clear that the PA's narrative is not only about him, as he addresses the allegations concerning the AA and his father.\n[75] I have considered whether the Appellants' supporting documentation is capable of independently establishing their allegations with respect to the PA's alleged abduction on XXXX XXXX, 2018, however I find that it is not. As the RPD correctly noted, the PA' photos cannot establish their allegations. They do not establish the identity of the injured person, the date of the injuries, or their cause. For the most part, the Appellants' supporting letters provide only general and brief information about the alleged abduction. The letter from the local resident who allegedly found the PA after his abduction is more detailed, however it does not shed light on who or what caused his injuries. The author merely infers that a cartel was responsible given criminal activity in his area. I find that the Appellants' documentary evidence is insufficient to establish the PA's allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\n[76] Therefore, while I accept the Appellants' testimony about events that they experienced in 2017, I do not accept the PA's allegation that he was abducted on XXXX XXXX, 2018, or that his father was subsequently extorted or threatened as a result. There is no evidence that the Appellants were threatened by the CJNG, or had any interactions with the cartel after XXXX 2017, including after they returned to the same city in Mexico in XXXX 2018, where they were originally threatened by the cartel.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Merida\n[77] As per Rasaratnam, the two-pronged test for an IFA is as follows. The panel must be satisfied that (1) there is no serious possibility of the Appellant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA,44 and (2) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellant, for them to seek refuge there.45\n[78] Once IFA is raised as an issue, the onus is on the Appellant to show that they do not have an IFA.46 The burden placed on the Appellant is high in order to show that the IFA is unreasonable. The test to show that the IFA is unreasonable requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the Appellant in relocating to a safe place. Actual and concrete evidence of adverse conditions is required.\nThe IFA meets the first prong of the test: the Appellants are not at risk in M\u00e9rida\n[79] The RPD acknowledged the objective documentary evidence that the CJNG may operate in the IFA location, and that, in general, cartels maintain a fluid presence throughout Mexico. It also noted that cartels rely on family networks, and use other methods, some of which are sophisticated, such as GPS trackers, to find their targets. The RPD found that the preponderance of the objective documentary evidence establishes that if an organized crime group is sufficiently motivated, it potentially has the means to find individuals throughout Mexico.\n[80] However, after considering the circumstances of the case, the RPD found that in spite of having the means, there is insufficient evidence that the CJNG have the motivation to pursue the Appellants to the IFA location.\n[81] The RPD considered that no one in the PA's family or the AA's family has been approached by the CJNG. Although the PA alleges that his father was contacted by his son's abductors in XXXX 2018, the calls stopped after he changed his phone number. In any case, as already noted, I find that this allegation lacks credibility. Overall, the RPD concluded, even if one accepts the Appellants' allegations, there is no evidence that the perpetrators have looked for or threatened the Appellants or their family members in Mexico since the Appellants left XXXX, Morelos, in XXXX 2018.\n[82] The RPD found that the Appellants' assertion that they will be found and harmed anywhere in Mexico to be speculative, and that, on a balance of probabilities, the perpetrators would not be motivated in pursuing them unless they return to XXXX.\n[83] I agree with the RPD that the Appellants failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm, the CJNG, possess the motivation to find and harm them in Merida, Yucatan.\n[84] The Appellants argue that the CJNG has a presence throughout Mexico, including Merida. They submit that the CJNG is the most powerful criminal organization in Mexico. They submit that Mexico has high levels of corruption, and the cartel has connections with the Mexican authorities. Additionally, the CJNG has insiders working for them, including taxi drivers, airport workers, police officers, politicians, and vendors on the street. The Appellants submit that the CJNG has the resources to locate them in Merida.\n[85] I find that the objective documentary evidence establishes that \"[i]f a criminal group has very strong motivation to find and retaliate against a certain person...especially if the criminal group were one of the more powerful groups in Mexico\" and\/or \"a group with indications of having cooperation from relevant authorities,\" then \"[the ability to track or retaliate against a certain person] would be a reasonable concern to have.\"47 According to one source, \"if organized crime groups in other parts of Mexico are \"interested and willing to retaliate against people relocated in [M\u00e9rida, Campeche, Cabo San Lucas, or Mexico City], they could do it easily.\"48 The evidence indicates that cartels may employ \"corrupt law enforcement agents\" to obtain information about people they pursue.49\n[86] The affidavits that the Appellants have provided from a military and a police officer concerning the capacity of organized criminal groups to track their targets, and their use of corrupt police officers and officials, support and are consistent with these findings.50\n[87] However, the objective documentary evidence also shows that not every target or person of interest to the CJNG is \"worth the time or resources...to track.\"51 \"[It] is an oversimplification to say that a group will track just anyone. It really depends on who you are and what you did. Low ranking members are not worth the time or resources for armed groups to track and kill. Instead, high-ranking members or someone who betrayed a [high-ranking member of] a criminal organization may cause you to be tracked or targeted. Similarly [according to another source] the safety of an individual who relocates to flee from one of these organizations' threats depend on the interests a group may have to punish or retaliate against them. If the conflict is not too serious, a relocation might work. But if any of these organizations is interested in harming [an individual],\nno city will provide a safe haven.\"52 According to the objective documentary evidence, a large debt or personal vendetta could motivate an organized crime group to track someone outside their area.53\n[88] The Appellants argue that the CJNG are motivated to find and kill them because the PA refused to cooperate with them, which led them to lose money. Also, they argue that the CJNG demanded a monthly payment from the CJNG of XXXX pesos to avoid harming the PA, and then increased the amount.\n[89] I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish that the CJNG consider the Appellants targets that are \"worth the time or resources\" to track. They have not established that any conflict with the CJNG is sufficiently serious, that they are perceived by the CJNG to possess a large debt, or that any members of the CJNG have an ongoing personal vendetta against them.\n[90] The Court has found that even if an agent of persecution has the means to pursue an individual throughout the country, this does not demonstrate that they have the motivation to do so. In the absence of such motivation, the Board may reasonably conclude that there is no serious possibility of persecution.54 In assessing motivation, the Board may take into consideration the fact that the agents of harm did not bother the Appellant in the months before her departure to Canada even though she was not in hiding, or contact her family members.55 In this case, both circumstances apply, and I find that the RPD was correct to find that this is evidence of a lack of motivation on the part of the CJNG.\n[91] As already noted, I find that the Appellants have not credibly established that the PA was abducted or that the CJNG demanded a monthly payment from the PA's father. Nor have they demonstrated that the PA's refusal to transport drugs by motorcycle in XXXX 2017 would be sufficient to motivate the cartel to find and harm them in another state.\n[92] The Appellants' family members have not been contacted, approached, or threatened by the agents of harm. The AA has close family who reside in XXXX, the city where the Appellants were targeted by the CJNG in 2017. There is no credible evidence that the Appellants' family members have moved or taken any precautions other than changing phone numbers.\n[93] The PA asserts in his Memorandum that he \"told [his] parents moved out of the city.\" It is unclear where or how he conveyed this to the Board. He does not provide any further details, such as when they moved, or to where. I find no record of any such testimony in the transcript, BOC, or other admissible evidence. Therefore, I do not accept this statement. Moreover, even if this is true, this alone does not establish his claim, in the absence of any targeting of the Appellants' relatives.\n[94] Also, there is insufficient credible evidence of any interactions between the Appellants and the CJNG since XXXX 2017. The Appellants did not credibly establish that they were targeted by the CJNG after they moved back to Mexico in XXXX 2018, after spending five months in Canada. The Appellants resided in XXXX for another five months until they returned to Canada in XXXX 2018. The Appellants were not in hiding during this time. The PA returned to his previous work as a XXXX XXXX during this time.56\n[95] The Appellants submit that they already been persecuted, threatened, kidnapped, and tortured by one of the most dangerous crime organizations in the world. They submit that the CJNG managed to locate them after they moved to another part of XXXX.\n[96] I accept that the Appellants were threatened by the CJNG, and that the AA was the victim of an attempted abduction, in XXXX 2017. I find that these facts, particularly the attempted kidnapping and assault of the AA, indicate that the Appellants were local targets of the CJNG at that time. However, after considering all the facts and available evidence, I find that the Appellants have not established that the CJNG have any ongoing interest in finding and harming them that would constitute sufficient motivation to employ the cartel's capacity to pursue them to another part of Mexico, including the IFA. For the reasons already provided, I do not accept that the agents of harm found the PA after his return to Mexico in XXXX 2018.\n[97] The RPD made several other findings in favour of a viable IFA for the Appellants (under the first prong) findings, however I do not rely on these for my decision, and find that it is not necessary to consider them further.\n[98] For these reasons, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants would not be in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Merida.\nThe IFA meets the second prong of the test: the IFA is reasonable\n[99] The RPD found that the Appellants failed to establish that conditions in Merida are such that it would be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, for them to seek refuge there.\n[100] The RPD considered the Appellants' testimony that they have no family in the IFA location. The RPD noted that while family may facilitate their resettlement, the lack of family does not in and of itself render the IFA unreasonable.\n[101] The RPD also considered the Appellants' testimony that they have an autistic child who receives therapy in Canada. The RPD noted that there was no evidence that their child could not obtain treatment in Mexico. The RPD acknowledged that while the Appellants may prefer the treatment options in Canada, this is not a sufficient reason to find that the IFA would be unreasonable.\n[102] The RPD noted that the Appellants did not present any evidence to indicate that their Canadian-born child could not attend school, or that they would be unable to obtain housing, employment, medical or health care, in Merida.\n[103] The RPD considered that the Appellants have XXXX-level education and were employed prior to their departure from Mexico. The RPD found that the Appellants possessed skills and the means to travel to the IFA location, find work, and make a living there for their family.\n[104] The RPD analysed the objective country evidence in relation to the Appellants' personal circumstances. It noted that the Appellants are part of the linguistic, ethnic, and religious majority in Mexico. With few exceptions, there are no restrictions on movement throughout the country.\n[105] The Appellants do not contest these findings on appeal and have not provided any submissions with respect to the reasonableness of the IFA.\n[106] I agree with the RPD's findings for the same reasons it provides.\n[107] The Appellants face a high burden to show that the IFA is unreasonable. They have not met this burden by providing actual and concrete evidence of adverse conditions that would jeopardize their life and safety in relocating to the IFA.\n[108] Overall, I find that the Appellants have not demonstrated that it would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh for them to relocate to M\u00e9rida.\nCONCLUSION\n[109] I find that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Merida, Yucatan.\n[110] As this finding is determinative of the claim, it is not necessary to consider the other findings by the RPD.\n[111] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nC.

Bobkin\nTribunal\nCounsel for the person who is the subject of the appeal\nNicholas Owodunni\nConseil de la personne en cause\nDesignated representative\nN\/A\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I allow the appeal of XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant), a citizen of Nigeria.\n[2] The Appellant alleges he is bisexual. He alleges that he has had two same-sex relationships in Nigeria. He also says that he was pressured to marry a woman and did so. The Appellant alleges that his most recent same-sex partner was arrested and disclosed their relationship. Based on this, he fled Nigeria and made a refugee claim.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Appellant lacked credibility. Specifically, the RPD found that the Appellant's testimony about his two same-sex partners was vague. The RPD found that the corroborating documents did not overcome this.\n[4] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred. He argues that it is an error to ask SOGIESC individuals to hide their identity. He also argues that corroborating evidence may not be available. Ultimately, he argues that the RPD did not apply the SOGIESC Guideline.1 He also argues that it was incorrect to discount corroborating documents because they were notarized. Finally, he argues that his membership in the LGBTQ community in Toronto should be given more weight. The Appellant has not submitted new evidence, nor has he requested an oral hearing.\n[5] I find the RPD's decision is incorrect. On an independent assessment of the evidence, I find errors that arise perceptibly, though the Appellant's Counsel did not raise them. First, while I agree that the Appellant was vague about his testimony about his partners, I find that the RPD did not consider the totality of the evidence. I find that there was credible evidence of the Appellant's sexual orientation, and the RPD did not weigh this against the vague testimony. I find that there were no material inconsistencies and omissions, and the Appellant has met the standard of proof required in a refugee claim. I therefore find that he is a Convention refugee as it is trite that members of sexual minorities face a risk of persecution.\n[6] I did not give notice to the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (Minister) that I was considering the remainder of the Convention definition, as, in my view, this does not meet the test in Alazar. Given the certainty in the evidence regarding the risks to SOGIESC persons in Nigeria, my findings flow from overturning the credibility determination.\nDECISION\n[7] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\n[8] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 I find that the RPD's decision is not correct.\nThe RPD did not weigh the totality of the evidence: the Appellant is credible, on a balance of probabilities\n[9] Reviewing the evidence on the record, I find that the Appellant has established his allegations, on a balance of probabilities. This includes that he is a bisexual man and that he is wanted in Nigeria because of the discovery of his same-sex relationship.\nOn an independent assessment of the evidence, the Appellant's vague evidence does not undermine his credibility\n[10] The RPD found that the Appellant was vague in his testimony about his two same-sex partners. I find that the RPD's decision in this regard was nuanced and sensitive to the SOGIESC Guideline.\n[11] Nevertheless, the Refugee Appeal Division's (RAD's) standard of review is one of correctness. I take a different view of the Appellant's explanation that he still felt afraid and had difficulty giving his testimony. I accept that, given his history growing up in a country where same-sex relationships are considered an abomination, it would be difficult to testify openly in detail about these relationships.\n[12] Therefore, I find that the vagueness in the testimony about his partners does not undermine the Appellant's credibility.\n[13] Moreover, as I will discuss below, even if I were to confirm the RPD's findings on vagueness, I do not find that these are sufficient concerns to conclude that the Appellant is not credible, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe RPD did not weigh the vague testimony against the remainder of the testimony\n[14] The RPD's decision focuses only on the vague testimony and does not weigh it against the credible testimony. Reviewing the record in its totality, there was substantial credible evidence.\n[15] First, there were no material inconsistencies between the testimony and the Basis of Claim form (BOC). There were also no material omissions from the BOC or the testimony. The RPD did not mention this in its decision.\n[16] Second, and more significant, reviewing the testimony, I found it contained details which had a ring of truth. For example, the Appellant was able to explain how he managed to make a long-term same-sex relationship work in secret, while remaining married. He explained that he kept his boyfriend separate in a different state where he could plausibly be working. He also testified that, when his wife and children came to visit him, his boyfriend would go out of the house and sleep elsewhere.\n[17] Additionally, the Appellant testified about the pressure to marry and why he got married and why his boyfriend did not. He explained that, as the oldest male child, there was significant pressure for him to marry. He testified that his boyfriend was not the firstborn son, and therefore he did not have the same pressure to marry and did not do so.\n[18] I find these details to be compelling. The RPD made no mention of this, or of any other testimony. Based on the RPD's reasons, it seems that the only reason for the negative credibility decision was the vague testimony about the relationships. The RPD makes the negative findings and then goes on to state that documentary evidence does not overcome these findings.\n[19] The standard of proof in a refugee claim is a balance of probabilities. The RPD did not explain how the two negative credibility findings on vagueness are sufficient to outweigh the other credible testimony. In my view, they are not. Even if I accept that the Appellant was unreasonably vague in discussing his boyfriends, I find this vagueness is outweighed by the fact that his testimony is otherwise credible and consistent, and he gave details with the ring of truth.\n[20] Furthermore, as I will discuss below, I also find that there was documentary evidence which supports the Appellant's credibility.\nThe documentary evidence supports the claim\n[21] The RPD found that the documentary evidence did not outweigh the credibility concerns. Again, I disagree. As explained above, I find that the credibility concerns were either minor in comparison with the credible testimony, or were incorrect findings. Therefore, I do not find that they are sufficient to outweigh the documentary evidence.\n[22] I accept that the Appellant's participation in the LGBTQ community in Toronto supports his alleged sexual orientation.\n[23] Regarding the affidavits from friends and family, I agree with the RPD that they are of limited weight given that they rely largely on reporting from the Appellant. I also agree that they are unusual in that they are sworn affidavits dealing with same-sex relationships which would be rare in Nigeria. I find these to be of limited weight, but they support the allegations.\nConclusion on credibility: the allegations are established, on a balance of probabilities\n[24] Based on the Appellant's testimony, and his evidence of participation in the LGBTQ community in Canada, I accept his allegations as credible, on a balance of probabilities. I find that he has established that he is bisexual and that his same-sex partner was arrested and killed. I find that he has established that his sexual orientation has been exposed as a result.\nThe Appellant meets the test for Convention refugee status\n[25] I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution based upon his sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is a particular social group which has a nexus to the Convention.\n[26] The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) indicates that, \"harassment, threats, discrimination, and incidents of violence\" against LGBTQI+ persons continue to be reported.3 State actors are reported to be involved in more than 10 percent of these incidents.4 A mere allegation or accusation of same-sex activity is often sufficient for arrest and detention.5 Sexual minorities face persecution in Nigeria from the state as well as members of the community, ranging from extortion and mob violence to death.6 Based upon this, I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution based upon his sexual orientation.\n[27] Regarding state protection, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to seek the protection of the Nigerian state. Nigerian authorities are known to target sexual minorities, as described above. The Appellant's evidence is that his same-sex partner was arrested, and their relationship is known to authorities. Therefore, the state is one of the agents of persecution in this claim.\n[28] I also find that there is no internal flight alternative (IFA) for the Appellant. Given that the country evidence of the treatment of sexual minorities is country-wide, and given that persecution comes from the state, I find that the Appellant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria.\n[29] For these reasons, the Appellant meets the definition of a Convention refugee. I did not give notice to the Minister that I would consider the remainder of the Convention definition. I considered whether \"the case has materially shifted away from the RPD's decision and the appeal as it was framed by the [person subject to the appeal]\"7 such that procedural fairness requires me to notify the Minister before rendering my decision. Given that the state is one of the agents of persecution in Nigeria, and the country documents on the treatment of sexual minorities are quite clear, I find that the case has not materially shifted. It naturally flows from a decision to overturn the credibility findings that the remainder of the test is met.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nErin Bobkin\nE.

She alleges a risk to her life from the Chinese Public Security Bureau (PSB) and X.T.,1 the daughter of the Deputy XXXX of XXXX City. The Appellant alleges that she taught X.T.'s son in the XXXX PSB Kindergarten. In 2019, the Appellant disciplined X.T.'s son for bullying other students; he was made to stand next to a wall. After this incident, the Appellant alleges that X.T. came to the school, assaulted her, and told her that she will die for abusing her son.2 The Appellant alleges that she was accosted and threatened by men who work for the Deputy XXXX. She also alleges that the police came to her home. In XXXX 2019,3 she left China for Canada and signed her Basis of Claim (BOC) form in March 2020. She alleges that the PSB continue to monitor and interrogate her husband in China.\n[3] This is the Appellant's second time before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). In October 2021, the first Refugee Protection Division (RPD) panel rejected the Appellant's claim. In July 2022, the first RAD panel found that the first RPD panel erred in assessing credibility and failed to question on material evidence in the claim.4 The first RAD panel allowed the Appellant's appeal and sent her claim back to the RPD to be redetermined. On redetermination, the second RPD panel recognized the Appellant as a vulnerable person based on her severe and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX), XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.5 The RPD applied the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) Chairperson's Guideline 8: Procedures with Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Vulnerable Persons Guideline).6 The second RPD panel rejected the Appellant's claim, finding that she failed to establish a nexus, she is not credible, and she has not established a claim under subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).7 The Appellant argues that this second RPD decision is incorrect. She argues that the RPD erred when it repeated the first RPD panel's plausibility findings, microscopically assessed the evidence, and failed to consider her psychological condition when assessing credibility. She has not filed any new evidence on appeal, and I cannot hold a hearing.8\n[4] I am reviewing the RPD decision on the standard of correctness as I do not find the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage.9 The RPD does not have a meaningful advantage simply because it held an oral hearing.10 I have the complete RPD Record, including the RPD hearing audio-recording and transcript. My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. In my independent assessment, I find the RPD's credibility and section 97(1) determinations are incorrect. I also find that the Appellant does not have access to state protection or an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in China and she is a person in need of protection.\nDECISION\n[5] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUE AT THE RAD\n[6] The Minister did not intervene in the Appellant's claim before the RPD or the RAD. Further to the Federal Court's decision in Alazar, I have considered whether \"the case has materially shifted away from the RPD decision and the appeal as it was framed by the [person subject to the appeal]\" such that procedural fairness requires me to notify the Minister before rendering my decision.11 I find that no such issue has arisen.\n[7] In my view, there is no new issue that is legally and factually distinct from the grounds of appeal which cannot reasonably be said to stem from the RPD decision or the issues on appeal as framed by the Appellant.12 The RPD found the Appellant not credible.13 In the Appeal Record, the Appellant argues that this finding is incorrect. She also argues that she fears the Chinese state. The absence of state protection and an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) reasonably stems from the Appellant's fear of state agents in China, given that the Chinese state exercises its power throughout the whole of its territory. The RPD also found that the Appellant failed to establish a nexus or a claim under subsection 97. In my view, each determinative issue in this appeal has been raised in, or reasonably stems from, the RPD decision and the Appeal Record. The Appeal Record was provided to the Minister.14 This has given the Minister sufficient notice of the live issues in this appeal. As such, there is no procedural fairness breach to the Minister in my finding that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nThe Appellant has credibly established her allegations, on a balance of probabilities\n[8] The RPD found the Appellant not credible because: (1) She omitted from her BOC the date that the police visited her home, and dates that the police visited her husband at home after she had already left China; (2) When describing the police visit in her BOC, she did not mention that the home was also searched; (3) When describing in her BOC that she was accosted and threatened on the street, she did not mention that she was also threatened with detention; (4) When describing in her BOC that her husband was questioned by police after she had already left China, she did not specify the treatment he received; and (5) While she corrected her personal history on her immigration forms, her first version contained an error. The RPD also made plausibility findings based on the actions of Chinese PSB and school authorities, drew an adverse inference based on the decision of the Appellant's adult daughter not to claim protection, made a negative finding based on the Appellant's delay in claiming, and accorded the supporting evidence little weight because the Appellant is not credible. Counsel argues that the RPD's credibility assessment is incorrect. I agree. In my independent assessment, I find that the RPD's credibility determination is in error. I find the Appellant has credibly established her allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe RPD erred in assigning little weight to the Appellant's XXXX evidence\n[9] The RPD designated the Appellant a vulnerable person based on the XXXX evidence on Record,15 pursuant to the Vulnerable Persons Guideline. The RPD offered the following procedural accommodations: a more informal setting for the proceeding, varying the order of questioning, providing a woman RPD Member and interpreter, and frequent breaks.16 However, Counsel before the RPD, who is different from Counsel on appeal, declined to question the Appellant first. In designating her a Vulnerable Person, the RPD accepted that the Appellant is a person \"whose ability to present their cases before the IRB is severely impaired.\"17 The RPD accepted the XXXX diagnosis.18 Despite this, the RPD did not consider the Appellant's symptoms or diagnosis when making credibility findings. The RPD assigned the XXXX report \"little evidentiary weight\" because the Appellant lacks credibility, the report is based on the Appellant's evidence, and the RPD is \"unable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the XXXX findings and the facts found in the claimant's request for refugee protection.\"19 Counsel argues that the RPD's credibility findings were \"made without regard to the Appellant's status as a Vulnerable Person in a seriously compromised mental state.\"20 I agree.\n[10] The Appellant's XXXX report indicates that she has XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.21 The XXXX outlines their qualifications, method of assessment, and how they reached their professional opinion. It is not the case that the report is based only on the Appellant's self-reporting. The XXXX clearly sets out the objective tests they performed in the assessment.22 Moreover, in Kanthasamy, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that XXXX reports will necessarily rely on some degree of hearsay and that a rejection of a report on this basis \"is unrealistic and results in the absence of significant evidence.\"23\n[11] In my view, the Appellant's XXXX report satisfies the requirements for an expert report identified in the Vulnerable Persons Guideline.24 Indeed, this report formed the basis of the RPD decision to accept that the Appellant's ability to present her case is severely impaired, and to designate her a Vulnerable Person.\n[12] I find that the XXXX report evidence sets out the Appellant's trauma response, including her XXXX XXXX XXXX and avoidance of XXXX XXXX, in detail, and I assign it full weight. The XXXX notes that the Appellant experiences:\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[...] Significant diminished ability to XXXX or XXXX as well as XXXX\n[...] Becoming XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,\")\nBecoming XXXX XXXX by reminders of XXXX XXXX (i,e,: reminders such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,)\nAvoidance of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,\")\nAvoidance of activities that might XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"I do XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,\")\n[...] [XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX [emphases added].25\n[13] In my view, this is significant. However, the RPD did not discuss this part of the report in its credibility assessment. The RPD erred when it failed to assess one of the principal reasons that this report was submitted into evidence-to explain the Appellant's difficulty with concentration and avoidance due to the trauma that she has experienced.\n[14] In my independent assessment, I have taken a trauma-informed approach. On July 18, 2022, the Chairperson announced that the IRB has an \"existing commitment to trauma-informed adjudication in all refugee and immigration cases involving individuals who have experienced trauma [emphasis added].\"26 Specifically, the IRB Chairperson states that \"recognizing the challenges people who have experienced trauma may face is part of the Board's overall adjudicative strategy for fair, timely and well-reasoned decision-making.\"27\n[15] Trauma-informed adjudication involves anticipating the possibility that trauma may impact a person's memory and their ability to provide testimony.28 While an allegation of trauma does not prevent an adverse finding based on material credibility concerns,29 decision-makers should \"consider the person's response and whether trauma or its aftereffects may reasonably explain the perceived discrepancy.\"30 For this reason, \"Members should consider whether an expert report that has been admitted into evidence explains any inconsistencies, omissions, or other credibility issues in respect of the person's testimony.\"31 This should take place \"when assessing the individual's credibility and not separately after the credibility assessment.\"32\n[16] Trauma can \"completely overwhelm an individual's ability to cope with, or integrate the ideas and emotions involved in that experience\" and a traumatic event \"can elicit intense feelings of fear, terror, helplessness, hopelessness, and despair often subjectively experienced as a threat to the person's survival.\"33 This is because \"[m]emories of traumatic events are processed differently neurologically from memories of non-threatening events\" which can impair coding, storage, and coherence of memories.34\n[17] In my view, the Appellant's trauma, as detailed in her XXXX report, reasonably explains her difficulty providing evidence about traumatic details. While the RPD is correct that the Appellant's BOC omits the specific dates of incidents, and she fails to include some of the traumatic details of events,35 I find that the Appellant's difficulty concentrating, and her avoidance of traumatic memories reasonably explains these omissions. It is not the case that she left out entire incidents; rather, her omissions concern traumatic details which are reasonably explained by her XXXX report. I draw no adverse inference on this basis.\n[18] Moreover, the Appellant provided letters from her husband, her husband's lawyer, and her neighbour which corroborate many of the details which the Appellant did not include in her BOC.36 In particular, the Appellant's husband's letter discusses his questioning by Chinese authorities on three occasions, including the failure of officials to provide him with food and water during his detention.37 The supporting documents were provided ahead of the RPD hearing. It is an error for the RPD to find a material omission where evidence is tendered by other means in advance of the hearing.38\n[19] Counsel also argues that the RPD microscopically assessed the evidence when it made a negative finding based on an error in the Appellant's personal history in her immigration forms. Counsel argues that the Appellant corrected her error, and no adverse inference was warranted.39 I agree. While the RPD acknowledges that the Appellant corrected her personal history on her immigration forms,40 it drew an adverse inference because the first version of the forms contained an error. In my independent assessment, I note that the Appellant mistakenly wrote in her first version of the form that she was in Canada from XXXX 2018 to present.41 However, in this same form, she also correctly included her time in China from XXXX 2018 to XXXX 2019 and specified her detailed address history.42 In another form completed on the same date, she also correctly included her travel history, noting that she left China for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019.43 I draw no adverse inference based on the Appellant's initial immigration form error.\nThe RPD's plausibility findings are in error\n[20] The RPD determined that the Appellant's ability to remain employed in China, her ability to secure an employment letter, her ability to retain her Chinese passport, and the absence of a summons is implausible.44 Counsel argues that these plausibility findings were not made in the clearest of cases and are incorrect.45 I agree. Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the RPD's plausibility findings are in error.\n[21] While the RPD is entitled to make findings based on rationality, common sense, or plausibility, such findings must be reasonably set out and supported by the evidence. The RPD findings are based on the plausibility of the actions of her employer and her agents of harm. It is an error to speculate about the actions of a reasonable persecutor or agent of harm.46 Moreover, implausibility findings are inherently subjective assessments that are largely dependent on an individual decision-maker's perceptions of what constitutes rational behaviour.47 It is because of this arbitrariness that implausibility findings should only be made in the \"clearest of cases\", where: (1) The facts are outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected; or (2) The documentary evidence demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner alleged.48 In my view, it is not outside the realm of possibility that the Appellant's employer would issue her a letter confirming the period of her employment, or that the employer would keep her on to perform cleaning tasks during the child abuse investigation. There is nothing in the objective evidence to support such findings. This is not the clearest of cases.\n[22] Moreover, the first RAD panel had already determined that a very similar plausibility finding made by the first RPD panel was in error. Specifically:\nThe RPD reasoned that the school where the PA [Principal Appellant] worked would not have continued to allow her to work around children (whether as a teacher or a cleaner) if she was the subject of a child abuse investigation [...]\nThe RPD's plausibility finding was not made in the clearest of cases. I could agree with the RPD if there were no evidence to the contrary. This is not the case. There is a letter from the PA's husband explaining that the police have questioned and detained him while looking for the PA. They questioned him about the PA's abuse and communicated their intent to arrest her.49\n[23] In redetermining the claim, the RPD did not explain why it was making this same finding which was already determined to be incorrect by the RAD. The RPD erred.\n[24] Counsel also argues that the RPD's plausibility finding related to the failure of the PSB to seize her passport misapprehends the objective evidence.50 I agree. The RPD referred to Item 10.7 in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for China in support of its finding that \"a person under investigation and surveillance by the police is required to surrender their passport to the authorities.\"51 However, Item 10.7 states that \"Chinese citizens who are under criminal detention have their ID and travel documents confiscated by the authorities.\"52 It also clarifies that \"it is unclear whether ID and travel documents are seized when a citizen is under investigation but has not been formally detained.\"53 I agree with Counsel's argument that this nuance is critical because the Appellant \"was never 'under criminal detention'\" and there are examples in the objective evidence of individuals who were questioned by Chinese authorities, but were never detained, who did not have their passports seized.54 In the circumstances of this appeal, I draw no adverse inference based on the failure of the PSB to seize the Appellant's passport.\n[25] Regarding the RPD's finding that the absence of a summons undermines the Appellant's credibility,55 I agree with Counsel's argument that the objective evidence indicates a summons \"may\" be issued, and that the issuance of a summons is discretionary and procedures are not always followed in practice.56 Federal Court caselaw warns against making assumptions about whether Chinese authorities would issue a summons.57 When the objective evidence \"provides that a summons 'may' be issued, it is not reasonable to determine that a failure to present a summons is so unlikely as to damage an Applicant's credibility [emphasis in original].\"58 In the circumstances of this appeal, I find that the absence of a summons does not undermine the Appellant's credibility.\nThe Appellant's delay in claiming is not determinative\n[26] The RPD found that the Appellant's nearly nine-month delay in claiming undermines her credibility.59 Counsel argues that the RPD misapprehended the length of the Appellant's delay and that an adverse inference on this basis is in error.60 While I agree with the RPD that the Appellant's delay in claiming does nothing to advance her claim, I do not find that this is determinative. I do not find that this delay rebuts the presumption of truthfulness of the Appellant's otherwise credible allegation that she was repeatedly targeted and threatened by X.T. and the PSB, as alleged. I also agree with Counsel the delay is seven-months, not nine-months.\n[27] I also note that the RPD drew an adverse inference based on the Appellant's daughter's decision not to claim protection.61 This is an error. The Appellant is not responsible for her adult daughter's decision. She remains on her student visa in Canada. I draw no adverse inference.\nThe RPD erred in assessing the corroborative evidence\n[28] The RPD assigned letters from the Appellant's husband, husband's lawyer, and neighbour little evidentiary weight.62 Counsel argues that this finding is in error.63 I agree.\n[29] While a Claimant's lack of credibility can extend to their supporting documents,64 corroborative evidence should not be disbelieved simply because a Claimant is not believed.65 Otherwise, a decision-maker risks reasoning in a way that \"begs the question at issue; it is impermissible to reach a conclusion based on certain evidence and dismiss the remaining evidence as inconsistent with that conclusion.\"66\n[30] Moreover, as set out by the Federal Court in Magonza, weight can only be assessed as a function of credibility and probative value:\nThus, weight is a function of credibility and probative value or, if one likes to see this in the form of an equation, weight = (credibility) x (probative value).\n[...] To explain this in mathematical terms, if the letter's credibility is zero (it is not authentic), then its weight is zero times its probative value, which always equals zero. In contrast, if the letter is authentic and has high probative value because its contents are closely linked to a conclusion of persecution, it can only have significant weight.67\n[31] In assigning the supporting evidence \"little evidentiary weight\" despite its probative value, the RPD erred. A document is \"either authentic or it is not. If it is not authentic, it should be given no weight.\"68 I can correct the RPD's error in my independent assessment. Having already set aside the RPD's negative credibility findings, I give this evidence full weight in my assessment.\nCredibility summary\n[32] Having independently assessed the entire Record, I find that the Appellant has credibly established her allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\nUnchallenged RPD finding that the Appellant lacks a nexus is correct\n[33] The RPD found that the Appellant's claim does not have a nexus to a Convention ground.69 Counsel does not identify any error in this finding, and I find none in my independent assessment. I find the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution by reason of her race, nationality, political opinion, religion, or particular social group. Having failed to establish a nexus, the Appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA. I will assess her claim under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nThe Appellant has established her claim against China\n[34] Having conducted my own assessment of the Record, I find that the Appellant has established her subsection 97(1) claim against China, and that she does not have access to state protection or a viable IFA.\nThe Appellant faces a personalized risk to her life under subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA\n[35] Having independently assessed the evidence, I find that the Appellant faces a personalized risk to her life that is not faced generally by others in China, under subsection 97(1)(b).\n[36] The analysis of subsection 97(1)(b) claims involves two stages. In my earlier decision70 recently identified as a Jurisprudential Guide (JG),71 I summarized these stages as follows:\nFirst Stage: Determine the risk faced by the Claimant\n* Clearly identify the nature of any ongoing or future risk.\n* Clearly identify the basis (or initial reason) for the risk.\n* Clearly identify the degree of the risk (or proximity to the risk). Consider any relevant factor, such as:\no The severity and number of incidents; and\no Any pattern or link between the incidents; and\no Any change over time.\nSecond Stage: Determine whether the risk is faced generally by others\n* Compare the nature and degree of the risk faced by the Claimant with the nature and degree of the risk faced generally by other individuals in or from their country.\n[37] This framework builds on the Federal Court cases of Portillo and Correa.72\n[38] First Stage: The Appellant was personally threatened with death on multiple occasions. X.T. assaulted her and threatened that that she will die for abusing her son.73 In XXXX 2019, her agent of harm also warned her that she will ruin her life until she is dead in jail.\"74 In XXXX 2019, she was pursued on the street by men who work for the Deputy XXXX who accosted and threatened her with harm. Once the police became involved, the matter escalated. Even after the Appellant fled China, her husband continues to be contacted by Chinese authorities. The initial basis for this personal risk-false allegations as revenge for disciplining a misbehaving student from a powerful family-is distinct from the nature of the risk itself-risk to life.\n[39] I find that the risk to the Appellant has increased in degree over time. It progressed from assaults and death threats at her place of employment, to a pursuit in the streets and at her home, as well as police interrogations of her husband even after she fled China. The Chinese authorities denied the Appellant's husband food and water. In my view, this is significant. There is a pattern of events that are connected through repeated threats and targeting. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant faces a personal risk to her life.\n[40] Second Stage: I find that the Appellant's risk to life is distinguishable in nature and degree from the risk faced generally by others in China. The general population in China does not currently face a risk to their life as revenge for disciplining a misbehaving student from a powerful family. In my view, the Appellant faces a high degree of proximate risk to her life. I note that the question is not whether others could eventually find themselves in the Appellant's position but, rather, whether others generally are in that position now.75 I find that the Appellant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that she faces a personalized risk to her life that is not faced generally by others in China, under subsection 97(1)(b).\n[41] Given that I find the Appellant's allegations credible, on a balance of probabilities, I further find that the risk that she faces is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions. Her pursuit by the PSB in China is based on false allegations in order to protect the interests of a powerful person, the Deputy XXXX of XXXX City. The Appellant's risk to life is also not caused by the state's inability to provide medical care. This satisfies subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the IRPA.\nNeither adequate state protection nor IFA are available to the Appellant\n[42] I further find that the Appellant does not have access to adequate state protection or a viable IFA in China, satisfying subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(i) and (ii) of the IRPA. It would be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to seek the protection of the state because it is the state that she fears. The Chinese government exercises its power throughout the whole of its territory. As such, the Appellant does not have a viable IFA anywhere in China.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJ. Pollock\nJ.

He alleges a fear of returning to China based on his religion, as a follower of the Church of Almighty God.1 In 2017, he alleges that his friend introduced him to the Church of Almighty God. In XXXX 2018, he alleges that he began attending an Almighty God house church. In XXXX 2018, he alleges that the Chinese Public Security Bureau (PSB) arrested a practitioner and his friend went into hiding. In XXXX 2019, he alleges that he fled China for Canada on an improperly obtained passport with the help of an agent. He made his Canadian refugee claim after his agent returned his genuine identity documents.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellant's claim, finding that he is not credible based on the following concerns: (1) He was inconsistent about whether he practiced in 2 or 7 house churches in China; (2) He was inconsistent about the time of day that he attends church service in Canada; and (3) His testimony about church service in Canada is vague. The RPD also found that his corroborative evidence is insufficient to establish the genuineness of his belief and that he failed to establish a sur place claim. The Appellant argues that the RPD Decision is incorrect. He has not submitted any new evidence on appeal, and I cannot hold a hearing.2\n[4] I am reviewing the RPD decision on the standard of correctness as I do not find the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage.3 The RPD does not have a meaningful advantage simply because it held an oral hearing.4 I have the complete RPD Record, including the RPD hearing audio-recording and transcript. My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. Having independently assessed the entire Record, I find that the RPD's credibility findings are incorrect. When the evidence is assessed in totality, I find that the Appellant has credibly established his Almighty God religion, on a balance of probabilities.\nDECISION\n[5] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES AT THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[6] The Minister did not intervene in the Appellant's claim before the RPD or the RAD. Further to the Federal Court's decision in Alazar, I have considered whether \"the case has materially shifted away from the RPD's decision and the appeal as it was framed by the [person subject to the appeal]\" such that procedural fairness requires me to notify the Minister before rendering my decision.5 I find that no such issue has arisen. The Appellant argues that the RPD's credibility findings are incorrect. He also repeats his fear of the Chinese state. China exercises power throughout its territory. The absence of state protection and an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) reasonably stems from the Appellant's fear of the state in China. Each determinative issue in this appeal has been raised in, or reasonably stems from, the Appellant's submissions. The RPD Record and Appeal Record were provided to the Minister.6 The Minister has sufficient notice of the issues in this appeal. There is no procedural fairness breach to the Minister in my finding that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nThe Appellant has credibly established his claim, on a balance of probabilities\nThe Appellant has established the genuineness of his faith, on a balance of probabilities\n[7] The RPD determined that the Appellant is not credible about his alleged religious practice in China because he was inconsistent about the number of house churches he attended in China as well as the time of day that he attends church in Canada.7 In my view, the Appellant's inability to recall with precision the exact number of house churches that he attended in China - whether 2 or 7 - as well as his inability to consistently recall the time of day that he attends church in Canada are details easily impacted by the fallibility of memory. I am also mindful that the Appellant has 9 years of formal education.8 The Appellant was consistent about the substance of his church attendance in China and Canada. The RPD also determined that the Appellant provided vague testimony about his religious practice in Canada.9 The Appellant alleged that members his practice group in Canada have different viewpoints about a passage in the Church of Almighty God text, The Words Appear in the Flesh. While he could explain his own views, he could not recall the differing views held by others in his practice group. In the RPD's view, the Appellant's inability to explain an alternate view is not commensurate with his alleged church attendance. Counsel argues that this finding is in error because \"[t]here is a difference between not remembering all of the details of one practice session and not knowing the precepts of one's faith\" and \"[t]he fact that the Appellant could not recall what his fellow members said on one occasion does not mean that he lacks religious knowledge.\"10 I agree. As Counsel points out, the Appellant provided the following detailed testimony about his practice in Canada:\n* His most recent experience with his Almighty God Church group took place on the weekend prior to the hearing when he spread the gospel at the Pacific Mall and told passersby about the Era of Kingdom.\n* On the weekend before spreading the gospel, he and his Church of Almighty God group gathered to study, pray, and eat and drink God's word. In particular:\no The group discussed the Church of Almighty God text, The Word Appears in the Flesh.\no The group discussed the birth of the Almighty God.\no Group members took turns discussing and providing different viewpoints about a passage from the Almighty God text.\no The Appellant provided his interpretation of the passage, being that when the Almighty God appeared, she appeared as a woman, and that this was the second time that God had appeared as a human being. He also said that Almighty God came to earth to save and free us, and thar she would finish the Era of Grace and to lead us to the Era of Kingdom.11\n[8] The RPD's finding is in error.\n[9] The RPD determined that the Appellant demonstrated knowledge of Church of Almighty God teachings.12 Having independently assessed the Record, I agree. I find that the Appellant has presented evidence of detailed, genuine religious knowledge. He correctly testified about a number of important tenants in the Church of Almighty God faith, including his favourite part of The Words Appear in the Flesh; the three eras (ages), including the Era of Law, the Era of Grace, the Era of Kingdom; when God appeared as a woman; how God defeated Satan; and the significance of lightening.13 In my view, the Appellant has presented sufficient evidence of sincere religious knowledge that is commensurate with his practice history and 9 years of education. I also find that his church letter, wife's letter, and photographs assist in establishing his claim.14 He has credibly established the sincerity of his faith.\n[10] In my independent assessment, I find the Appellant has credibly established his allegations, including his genuine faith as a practitioner of the Church of Almighty God, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe Appellant has established his claim against China\n[11] Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution upon return to China as a practitioner of Church of Almighty God, his fears are well-founded, and he does not have access to state protection or a viable IFA.\nThe Appellant's claim against China is well-founded\n[12] The Chinese state has declared the Church of Almighty God to be Xie Jiao, or an 'evil cult.'15 The Church of Almighty God is viewed as \"hostile to the government and dangerous\" and it is \"'persecuted' in China.\"16 Being active \"in any capacity in the [Church of Almighty God] CAG is regarded as a crime in China, and it exposes [one] to serious jail penalties.\"17 Practitioners are subject to arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture, and extra-judicial killing.18 The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) designated China a County of Particular Concern based on based on systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.19 The USCIRF notes that the Chinese government \"escalated its persecution of the Church of Almighty God, reportedly arresting thousands of its members throughout China and torturing many for practicing their faith.\"20 Having independently assessed the evidence, I find that the Appellant's claim is well-founded and he faces a serious possibility of persecution in China.\nNeither adequate state protection nor IFA are available to the Appellant\n[13] It would be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to seek the protection of the state because it is the state that he fears. The Chinese government exercises its power throughout the whole of its territory. As such, the Appellant does not have a viable IFA anywhere in China.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] The appeal is allowed.

He claims that as he is involved in a land dispute, he is a Convention refugee\/person in need of protection. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that he had an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Bengaluru. He has appealed this decision. Having reviewed the record, I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Appellant bases his claim on the following.\n[3] He was born on XXXX XXXX, 1997, and lived in a village in XXXX, Punjab. His father and his brothers inherited land from his grandfather. His great-grandfather thought that he should have inherited the land.\n[4] In 1986 his uncle was murdered by the Appellant's great-uncle and his sons. They were arrested but were acquitted. In 2013, his father went to work and never returned. His disappearance was viewed that this was linked to the land dispute.\n[5] The land is now in the name of the Appellant's mother. The great uncle and his sons threatened the Appellant and his family. They tell the Appellant's mother to give them the land or they will kill her sons. The great uncle is rich and one of his sons has a connection to a member of legislative assembly (MLA).\n[6] The Appellant has been attacked three times because of this land dispute. The first attack was in XXXX 2015 when he and his brother were returning to work. The Appellant reported this to the police, but they did not help. The Appellant believes that it is because of the son's connection with the MLA. The second was in XXXX 2016. Thereafter, the Appellant's brother went to Dubai. The Appellant went to Dubai as a tourist. After returning to India, he was attacked again in XXXX 2019. He came to Canada and claimed protection.\n[7] The great uncle has passed away, but the sons still want the property. When they see the Appellant's mother, they tell her to give them the property or they will kill her son.\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellant had an IFA in Bengaluru and denied the claim appeal. The Appellant has appealed to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). Upon appeal, he has not provided new evidence; nor has he requested an oral hearing. Without new evidence, the RAD does not have jurisdiction to hold a hearing.1\n[9] The RAD has provided notice to the parties that it may consider other issues such as state protection and the current version of the National Documentation Package (NDP).\nANALYSIS\n[10] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 In this case, I do not find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral evidence, and I do not see any reason to depart from this standard in this case.\n[11] I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and arguments.3 This review includes reviewing transcripts of the entire hearing. A recording of the hearing is on record.\nThe RAD will consider whether the Appellant is a person in need of protection\n[12] The agents of harm in this appeal are the Appellant's great-uncle and his sons. Their interest is in the land that is in the mother's name. There is not sufficient evidence to find that the Appellant is facing persecution because of any of the grounds listed in the definition of a Convention refugee. For this reason, the RAD will consider whether the Appellant is a person in need of protection in accordance with section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In the definition of whether a person is in need of protection, it is clear that an internal flight alternative is a determinative consideration.\n[13] The RPD found that the Appellant's account of persecution was credible. I note that the corroborative evidence is not consistent with regards to the attacks; there is more supportive evidence for the attack in 2015, and less for 2016 and 2019. Nonetheless, I find that the Appellant's account of events in India is credible.\nThe Appellant has an IFA in Bengaluru\n[14] The analysis for assessing an IFA has two parts according to the Federal Court in Rasaratnam.4 The first step is to determine whether there is a serious possibility that the Appellant will be persecuted, or whether he faces, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to his life, torture, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA. The second step is to consider all of the Appellant's individual circumstances and the conditions in the proposed IFA to determine whether it would be unreasonable to seek refuge in the IFA. An Appellant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or undergo undue hardship in travelling there and staying there. The hardship associated with relocation is not the kind of undue hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable. The standard is high and requires proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in travelling to and in living in the IFA location.5 An IFA will only be viable if both criteria are met.6\n[15] The RPD raised Bengaluru properly as an IFA. Having done so, the burden of proof shifts to the Appellant to show that it is not a viable alternative.\nThe Appellant is not a person in need of protection in Bengaluru\nThe Agents of Harm do not have the motivation to seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru\n[16] The Appellants argue that the behaviour of the agents of harm has shown a sustained motivation to persecute. The agents of harm have periodically harmed the Appellant for years. His mother is harassed by the agents of harm who tell her to give them the land or they will kill her sons. The last time that they threatened her was at temple two months before the hearing which occurred on April 13, 2022.7 When the agents of harm see her, they threaten her.8\n[17] However, the confrontation in the temple in about XXXX 2022 is the last confrontation on record. There is not any evidence of a confrontation since then. Further, while I find that this is evidence of a risk in the Appellant's hometown, it is evidence of a localized risk. The affidavits, the Appellant's narrative and the weight of the evidence in general leads to a conclusion that the risk of harm is localized to the town of XXXX, or, at most, the area of the Punjab. There is not sufficient evidence that there is a threat outside of this area or in Bengaluru.\n[18] The Appellant argues that even if he does not own the land, the agents of harm use him for persecution. The agents of harm have an interest in the property. The property is in the name of the Appellant's mother. It is not clear whether she could sell the property as it is also in the name of the Appellant's father.9 However, the Appellant himself does not own the property. I accept that there have been repercussions for him, but his link to the property is indirect. Further, I must consider the nature and the frequency of the harm resulting to his indirect relationship with the land to assess whether it would likely result in a forward-looking risk of harm envisaged by section 97. In this appeal, I have found that it is not.\n[19] Further, there is not sufficient evidence to find that, although it has been going on for years, the behaviour of the agents of harm is increasing. Rather, the motivation of the agents of harm is, at best, one that results in harm for the Appellant on an infrequent basis even when he is in the village itself. As an example, he lived in his home for about three months after the last attack. While he spent the first few weeks at home, he still went out with his uncle two or three times.10 He then returned to work. I have considered the evidence that his uncle and his boss were with the police, but the Appellant was not in hiding at that time. There is not evidence of another incident with the agents of harm. I find that this is a significant amount of time to be active in a location where the agents of harm would know where he is. There is not sufficient evidence that there was a barrier to them being able to harm the Appellant; and they did not do so.\n[20] Given that the Appellant would be in Bengaluru, there is not sufficient evidence to find that they would have the motivation to go there to harm him there.\n[21] However, even if they did have the motivation to seek and harm the Appellant in Bangaluru, there is insufficient evidence that they would have the means to do so.\nThe agents of harm do not have the means to seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru\n[22] The Appellant argues that one of the sons has a relationship with the XXXX MLA. Further, this relationship would enable the agents of harm to seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru.\n[23] However, in the appeal, the evidence about the MLA is vague. Although the Appellant had sufficient opportunity to provide sufficient evidence that it is likely that this MLA could help the agents of harm to harm the Appellant in Bengaluru, he has not done so. There is not evidence of the name of the MLA or which party he belongs to. There is not evidence of whether he is still in the legislature or not. How the son is connected to the MLA is not shown in the evidence. In short, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that it is likely that this relationship would assist the agents of harm to seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru.\n[24] Further, while the agents of harm have financial resources, the Appellant has not shown how this would lead to a greater likelihood that they would have the means to find and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru. He has not shown how the agents of harm would use this resource to seek the Appellant in a different state. The Appellant testified that the agents of harm had connections outside of the village and paid people to do \"dirty deeds.\"11 However I find that this evidence, too, is vague. He did not cite any examples or provide any information about who these people were and where they were located. It is not sufficient evidence to find that it is likely that the agents of harm would be able to mobilize people to harm him in Bengaluru.\n[25] The Appellant has the burden of proof to show that there is likely a risk to life, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. He has had every opportunity to provide evidence. He was represented both at the RAD and at the RPD. There is insufficient evidence of any barrier to provide evidence. However, he has not discharged this burden.\n[26] While the police in the Appellant's hometown might not be helpful, it is unlikely that there would be a need for help as the agents of harm would not seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru.\n[27] The Appellant argues that the MLA could use his influence to find him through the tenant verification system; however, I find that there is not sufficient evidence to find that this is likely. He quotes the opening paragraph of an Immigration and Refugee Board Response to Information Request which states that tenant verification is to maintain a database for people living in a particular area.12 He argues that one does not need to be searched for a crime by the police to be found through the tenant verification system. Rather, the agents of harm could find him through the MLA as he would be registered with the police. However, I have pointed out the issues with the evidence regarding the MLA; there is not enough information on record to find that there is a likelihood that he or she could help the agents of harm. Further, it is speculative to conclude that an MLA would use his influence to locate the tenant registry in Bengaluru. There is not sufficient evidence to find that it is likely that this would occur.\n[28] Further, the Appellant is not being sought by the police; hence, registering with the tenant verification is not likely to expose him. Similarly, should he use his Aadhaar card, there is not sufficient evidence to find that there is a likelihood that the agents of harm could locate him.\n[29] The Appellant did not dispute findings regarding population and location. Having reviewed the record, I see no reason to interfere with that finding to prevent an injustice.13 Having performed an independent review of the record, I do not find a reason to interfere with the RPD's findings that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that there is an MLA who has influence over the police.\nIt is reasonable for the Appellant to relocate and live in Bengaluru\n[30] Each analysis of whether there is undue hardship must take into consideration an appellant's individual characteristics. In this appeal, the Appellant is young; he is about 25 years old. There is not a record of any health concerns. He has a XXXX XXXX education. He is Sikh. He speaks some Hindi and Punjabi.\n[31] Upon appeal, the Appellant did not challenge RPD's reasonableness findings. Appellants who do not challenge the RPD's findings do so upon their own peril.14 Having reviewed the evidence, I do not find that there is a reason to find otherwise. As an example, it is likely that the Appellant could find work in Bengaluru. At the hearing, the Appellant stated that there was the possibility that he could find work there.15 He has worked in XXXX16 and as a XXXX in Canada.17 The evidence leads to the conclusion that he could find work in Bengaluru.\n[32] There are issues with housing in India; but as it is likely that the Appellant would find work, it is also likely that he would have the means to acquire housing.\n[33] The main languages in Karnataka are Kannada, Urdu and Telugu; however, Hindi is spoken by 43.6% of the population in India and is the predominant language.18 I do not find that this is a sufficient challenge to present the life-threatening type of hardship that meets the threshold of undue hardship.\n[34] For these reasons, I find that even on a cumulative basis, the Appellant would not face undue hardship should he have to relocate and live in Bengaluru. It is not unreasonable for him to do so.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPatricia Broad\nPatricia Broad\nJanuary 11, 2023\nDate\n1 Section 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Celi\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I allow this appeal for the reasons that follow.\n[2] This is an appeal filed by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Minister) with respect to the claims filed by the Respondents, XXXX XXXX XXXX (Mr. S) and his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX (Ms. S), who are citizens of India. The Respondents fear that, if they return to India, they will be persecuted by certain leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Party and the Punjab police acting on their behalf (together, the agents of persecution).\n[3] The Respondents used to be members of the SAD Party but, in XXXX 2016, they began to support the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been the ruling party in Punjab state since 2017. The Respondents alleged that leaders from the SAD Party threatened them so they would not adversely affect their vote bank. They alleged that the SAD leaders started attacking them by using the police and that the police targeted them because they were attending AAP rallies and assisting others to attend those rallies. In 2017, Mr. S and his cousin were arrested by the police and falsely accused of being militants supporting the Khalistan movement (the name given to the independent state sought by Sikh nationalists). A few months later, Mr. S. was attacked by unknown persons who threatened to kill him for speaking out against the SAD Party. While Mr. S was away from home one day in XXXX 2017, the police raided his house and threatened Ms. S. The Respondents fled to Delhi to stay with a relative and they allege that the police attended at their relative's house to look for them. With the assistance of an agent, they left India to claim refugee protection in Canada in April 2018.\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the Respondents to be credible and it concluded that they did not have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in the city proposed by the RPD, that being Bengaluru. The IFA test has two prongs. The RPD did not consider the first prong of the IFA test. Instead, it found that the IFA test failed on the reasonableness prong, which is the second prong of the test.\n[5] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Minister) appealed the RPD's decision on the basis that it failed to take into account the employment experience that the Respondents have gained in Canada over the past five years when assessing whether the difficulties they would have in finding employment in Bengaluru would be so serious as to place their lives and safety in jeopardy.\nDECISION\n[6] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1 I agree with the Minister that the Respondents would have a viable IFA in Bengaluru.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[7] The Respondents' application to extend their work permit submitted by the Minister is admitted as new evidence under subsections 110(3) and 171(a.5) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[8] Neither the Minister nor the Respondents requested an oral hearing. I find that the new evidence admitted on appeal does not satisfy the conditions for the holding of an oral hearing.2 The new evidence relates to the alleged reasonableness of Bengaluru as an IFA for the Respondents. It does not raise any issues regarding their credibility.\nANALYSIS OF MERITS\nRPD erred in finding that the Respondents would not have a viable IFA in Bengaluru\n[9] The legal test for assessing whether a claimant has a viable IFA has two prongs.3 Under the first prong, the decision-maker assesses whether, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondents would face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA location or a likelihood that they would be subjected personally to any of the types of harm that would make them persons in need of protection there. Both prongs must be satisfied in order to make a finding that a claimant has a viable IFA.\nNo need to consider Mumbai as a viable IFA location\n[10] The Respondents' counsel argues that the \"pith and substance\" of the Minister's appeal was aimed at arguing that the RPD erred by failing to consider Mumbai as an IFA location. I do not agree.\n[11] The essence of the Minister's appeal is that the RPD erred in failing to consider the work experience that the Respondents have obtained in Canada when assessing whether it would be reasonable for them to relocate to an IFA location. The Minister's position was that the Respondents would have a viable IFA in Bengaluru, the IFA city proposed by the RPD. In addition, the Minister argued that the Respondents would have a viable IFA in Mumbai. Mumbai is one of the major metropolitan cities that the RPD frequently proposes as an IFA and the Minister argues the RPD should also have considered that city as a potential IFA location.\n[12] I do agree with the Minister that it is difficult to understand why the RPD would not have proposed Mumbai as a potential IFA city in this case. However, in my view, it is unnecessary to consider any submissions as to whether the Respondents would have a viable IFA in Mumbai. I accept the Minister's submission that the RPD erred in finding that the Respondents would not have a viable IFA in Bengaluru.\nRPD did not conduct an analysis under the first prong of the IFA test\n[13] The Minister noted that the RPD did not conduct an analysis under the first prong of the IFA test. It argued that neither the SAD Party nor the Punjab police would have the means or motivation to locate the Respondents if they were to return to India today and relocate to Bengaluru. The Respondents' counsel disagrees and argues that the RPD did consider the first prong of the IFA test, which he also refers to as the \"safety prong.\"\n[14] I agree with the Minister that the RPD did not apply the first prong of the IFA test since it found that the IFA test failed on the reasonableness prong of the IFA test (that is, the second prong).4 The passages quoted by the Respondents' counsel in which the RPD assessed whether the Respondents' lives and safety would be in jeopardy form part of the analysis under the second prong of the IFA test, not the first prong. As noted above, under the second prong, a decision-maker must assess whether it would be unreasonable to expect claimants to relocate to an IFA location. In order to establish that an IFA location is unreasonable, claimants must establish that their lives and safety would be in jeopardy in the IFA location. This was the \"safety\" analysis carried out by the RPD in its decision.\n[15] For the reasons set out above, I agree with the Minister that the RPD did not address the first prong of the IFA test. Presumably, the RPD determined that it did not need to address the first prong of the IFA test because it found that it would be unreasonable to expect the Respondents to relocate to Bengaluru. For the reasons set out further below, I find that this conclusion was made in error.\nRespondents have failed to satisfy the first prong of the IFA test\n[16] I agree with the Minister that the agents of persecution identified by the Respondents (that is, members of the SAD Party and the Punjab police) would not have the means and motivation to locate the Respondents in the IFA cities to persecute them if they were to relocate there today. I also do not agree with the Respondents' counsel that the Respondents would face a serious possibility of persecution in Bengaluru because they are supporters, or perceived supporters, of the Khalistan movement.\nSAD Party lacks means and motivation to track the Respondents to Bengaluru\n[17] The Respondents' counsel does not make any argument to respond to the Minister's position that the SAD Party or its members would not have the motivation or means to locate the Respondents if they relocated to Bengaluru today.\n[18] I agree with the Minister's position that the SAD Party has limited power and influence outside of Punjab state. Moreover, the SAD's influence has even diminished within Punjab state as the 10-year rule of the SAD\/BJP alliance in Punjab ended five years ago in 2017 and the SAD finished in third place in that election. In addition, there was no evidence of anyone from the SAD Party having any contact or communication whatsoever with the Respondents or their families since they left India over five years ago. Therefore, the evidence does not establish that anyone from the SAD Party would have either the means or motivation to locate the Respondents if they were to return to India and relocate to Bengaluru.\nPunjab police lack the means and motivation to track the Respondents to Bengaluru\n[19] The Minister argues that the Punjab police lacks the motivation and means to track the Respondents to Bengaluru if they were to relocate there today. The Respondents' counsel disagrees. On the issue of motivation, he notes that the RPD accepted as credible that the police raided the home of the Respondents' relatives in Delhi to look for them in 2017. On the issue of means, he argues that the police would have the means to locate the Respondents in Mumbai through the tenant verification process and through the use of surveillance technology. He makes no arguments in relation to the means available to the police to locate the Respondents in Bengaluru. However, in the paragraphs that follow, I address his arguments relating to Mumbai and apply them to the IFA of Bengaluru.\n[20] No motivation established: I do not agree with the Respondents' counsel that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the police would have the motivation to locate the Respondents if they were to return to India today and relocate to Bengaluru.\n[21] To begin, it is important to keep in mind that the primary agents of persecution identified by the Respondents were leaders of the SAD Party who were upset that they had changed their allegiance to the AAP. At all times, the Respondents testified that the police were acting at the behest of the SAD leaders when they levied false accusations against Mr. S. When the RPD asked Mr. S why the police was interested in him and his brother, he replied that it was because he and his brother had been going to AAP rallies and assisting people to attend those rallies.5 He testified that the police told him and his brother to not \"move away from our party.\"6 He also testified that, when he and his brother were detained, the police told them, \"do not support the other party (AAP).\"7 Therefore, it was the Respondents' consistent evidence that the police were targeting Mr. S on behalf of the SAD Party due to his support for the AAP.\n[22] While it is true that the RPD accepted as credible that the police raided the home of the Respondents' relatives who they stayed with in Delhi in or around 2017 to look for them, there was little evidence of any such searches since then. The affidavit that the Respondents filed from Mr. S's cousin in Delhi states that the police raided her house to look for Mr. S around the time he lived with them in 2017 and they left after they were paid a bribe. She then says \"since then, police have come to our home and we paid bribes\" without any further detail about these alleged visits.8 Likewise, the affidavit from Mr. S's sister makes allegations of police harassment that are similarly lacking in detail as she says only that \"police harassed my husband, GS, to coordinate with the police to find out the whereabouts of my brothers... we also pay bribes to the police.\" Again, there is no detail as to when this alleged harassment occurred and what form the harassment took. At the hearing, Mr. S testified that the police continued to ask his family about his whereabouts and leave once his family pays a bribe.\n[23] In my view, the evidence gives rise to an inference that, unfortunately, Mr. S's family has become a source of bribe payment for the police. The evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India makes clear that, if the police are intent on forcing someone to appear at a police station, they have various means at their disposal to do so.9 There was no evidence of any such tools being used by the police. Instead, they periodically visit Mr. S's relatives to ask about him and leave once they receive bribe money.\n[24] Overall, I do not find that there is sufficient evidence in this case that the police would have the motivation to expend the time and resources necessary to track the Respondents to Bengaluru if they were to return to India and relocate there today. The NDP for India indicates that there is little interstate police communications except in cases of major crimes like smuggling, terrorism, and some high-profile organized crime.10 As noted above, the evidence in this case was the police levied false allegations against Mr. S due to his change in support from the SAD to the AAP. In my view, his circumstances do not amount to the kind of \"major crime\" that would provide the police with the motivation to engage in the kind of interstate communications that would be necessary to track them down if they were to return to India and relocate to Bengaluru today.\n[25] No means established: I also do not agree with the Respondents' counsel that the police would have the means to track the Respondents down in Bengaluru through the tenant verification process or through the use of surveillance technology.\n[26] The only argument made by the Respondents' counsel with respect to the tenant verification process is that landlords are legally required to carry out tenant verification through their local police. While this is accurate, NDP contains mixed evidence as to whether police actually conduct tenant verification checks.\n[27] While India does have laws requiring the registration of new tenants, the NDP for India indicates that the actual verification of tenant backgrounds with the police in their home state is very limited because police are ill-equipped and short-staffed. A research report in the NDP on the tenant verification system and police databases reproduces a quote from a former deputy Delhi commissioner of police in an India Today article in which they stated that tenant verification is \"done for the psychological satisfaction, nor for actual background check.... The cops don't make any effort to follow up with the concerned police station of other states.\"11\n[28] The same research report does reproduce a quote from a Station House Officer in XXXX, speaking anonymously to the Indian Express newspaper, who said that that they sent information sheets to the area Station House Officer and that they receive replies from some neighbouring states such as XXXX and even XXXX XXXX.12 However, I prefer the information set out above from the former Delhi police commissioner of police over the anonymous Station House Officer quoted in the Indian Express article given his higher position and location in one of the IFA cities. This information indicates that police do not make an effort to follow up with police in other states regarding tenant verification.\n[29] In any event, even if the police did conduct a tenant verification check, the most recent evidence in the NDP indicates that they now would conduct such checks by consulting the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network Systems (CCTNS) database.13 However, in this case, even if the police forces in the IFA cities conducted a criminal check for the Appellants, they are unlikely to find anything, given that the evidence did not establish that the Appellants' personal information likely appears in the CCTNS database.\n[30] For the above reasons, I agree with the Minister that there is no serious possibility that the Punjab police would be able to track the Respondents through the tenant verification process.\n[31] I also do not agree with the arguments made by the Respondents' counsel as to how he believes the police would be able to locate the Respondents through the use of surveillance technology. The passage from the NDP quoted by Counsel refers to the Indian government's use of surveillance to monitor internet and social media use as well as telephone calls. This evidence does not apply to this case since the Respondents alleged no fear of the government of India.\n[32] The passage also states the police can ask telephone providers to triangulate the location of a mobile phone using cell phone towers or by securing details of an email account. In this case, there was no evidence regarding the Respondents' mobile phone or email usage and whether the police would have any information about any mobile phones or email addresses they might be using if they returned to India and relocated to Bengaluru. Therefore, I do not agree with the Respondents' counsel that the evidence supports his assertion that there is a serious possibility that the police would be able to track the Respondents to Bengaluru through surveillance technology.\n[33] For the above reasons, I agree with the Minister that the evidence does not establish a serious possibility that the Punjab police would have either the motivation or means to track the Respondents to persecute them if they return to India and relocate to Bengaluru.\nNo serious risk of persecution as real or perceived Khalistan supporters\n[34] The Respondents' counsel argues that the documentary evidence shows that \"as Khalistan supporters\"14, the Respondents' safety is clearly at risk everywhere in India. I disagree for several reasons which I set out below.\n[35] First, the Respondents are not Khalistan supporters. Therefore, the sources relied upon by Counsel to the effect that Khalistan supporters are not safe anywhere in India do not apply to the Respondents' profile as they are not Khalistan supporters. The respondents are supporters of the AAP, which is currently the ruling party in Punjab state. There was no evidence that they had ever been Khalistan supporters and Mr. S testified that they are not supporters of Khalistan.15\n[36] Second, I do not agree with Counsel that the Respondents would face a serious possibility of persecution as perceived Khalistan supporters if they were to relocate to Bengaluru. As noted above, the Respondents are not Khalistan supporters nor have never been Khalistan supporters. The evidence does not establish a serious possibility that anyone in Bengaluru would perceive them to be Khalistan supporters and persecute them for this reason. While it may be that the Punjab police accused Mr. S of being a Khalistan supporter in 2017, for the reasons set out above, the evidence was that they levied this false allegation against him because he had shifted allegiances from the SAD to the AAP. Moreover, as detailed above, the evidence does not establish a serious possibility that the Punjab police would have the means and motivation to track the Respondents if they were to relocate to Bengaluru today.\n[37] For all of the above reasons, I do not find that the Respondents have met their onus of establishing that they would face a serious possibility of persecution or a likelihood of serious harm if they were to relocate to Bengaluru.\nRPD erred under second prong of the IFA test\n[38] Under the second prong of the IFA test, a decision-maker must assess whether it would be unreasonable in all the circumstances to expect a claimant to relocate to one of the IFA cities. The threshold for unreasonableness is very high and requires that a claimant's life and safety be in jeopardy. 16\n[39] The RPD found that the Respondents' lives and safety would be jeopardized if they were to relocate to Bengaluru. It found that the claimants are not highly educated and that they only had work experience in India as a XXXX and XXXX, respectively. It also noted that the Respondents only speak Punjabi and the member appeared to accept their explanation of having been able to maneuver through life in Canada without speaking either official language because an interpreter is provided for them for official matters such as going to the hospital or getting medicine.\n[40] The Minister argued that the RPD erred in failing to take into account the work experience that the Respondents have gained in Canada in its analysis under the second prong of the IFA test. The Minister relied upon the new evidence I have admitted to argue that the Respondents have been able to gain work experience in Canada despite their limited education and language abilities. The Respondents' counsel did not respond to the Minister's arguments under the second prong of the IFA test.\n[41] I agree with the Minister that the RPD erred in only taking into account the work experience that the Respondents had gained before leaving India and not taking into account their experience working in Canada. I also agree that the new evidence admitted demonstrates that the Respondents have been able to gain work experience in Canada (in particular, in the province of Quebec) despite the fact that they do not speak French or English. While the Respondents may have some difficulties finding work in Bengaluru, the evidence does not establish that such difficulties are likely to be so serious as to put their lives and safety in danger.\n[42] Sikhs living outside the Punjab have access to housing, employment, health care, education and freedom to practice their religion and that they do not generally face difficulties relocating to other areas of India.17 Bengaluru is a major demographically diverse city. It has a population of over 13 million and it is the fastest growing metropolis in India. It is also located in the fourth most favourable state to work for women in India. As noted by the Minister, the Respondents have been working in a XXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada. They failed to establish that they would not be able to find similar work in Bengaluru. They have also failed to establish that there are any other factors that would be so serious as to place their lives and safety in jeopardy in Bengaluru.\n[43] For all of the above reasons, the RPD erred in finding that it would be unreasonable to expect the Respondents to relocate to Bengaluru. It also erred in finding that they would not have a viable IFA in that city.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] For the above reasons, the appeal is allowed and the RPD's decision is set aside. I substitute my own determination that the Respondents are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJo-Anne Pickel\nJo-Anne Pickel\nFebruary 10, 2023\nDate\n1Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He fears harm from the XXXX XXXX (XXXX) of his former employer. He also fears persecution in Jordan due to his Palestinian origin.\n[2] The procedural history of this matter is accurately set out in paragraphs 2 through 9 of the Decision of the Refugee Protection Decision (RPD) dated June 13, 2022, which denied the Appellant's claim.\n[3] The RPD determined that the Appellant was not excluded from refugee protection under Article 1F(b) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The determinative issue at the RPD was credibility. The RPD found that the accumulation of contradictions, inconsistencies, and omissions regarding material elements of the Appellant's claim supported a negative conclusion about his credibility. The RPD found that while the Appellant alleged in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form that he feared harm from his former girlfriend's family in Jordan and his employer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia), at the hearing he confirmed that he feared one person, the XXXX at his former employer in Saudi Arabia, due to the Appellant's alleged refusal to participate in money laundering through the importation of XXXX containing money. The RPD found that the Appellant's testimony on this issue was vague and internally inconsistent and that the corroborative evidence did not sufficiently overcome the evidentiary deficits that arose from the credibility analysis. Finally, the RPD found that the Appellant in his circumstances would not face discrimination amounting to persecution if he returned to Jordan.\n[4] The Appellant is not represented by counsel on the appeal. He submits that the RPD erred in its credibility analysis. He submits that the RPD failed to make clear credibility findings and instead cast a nebulous cloud of unreliability around his evidence and testimony. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in impugning his credibility based on BOC omissions as he was not required to update his BOC before the RPD hearing. He asserts that the RPD ignored relevant testimony and country conditions evidence of the risks of deportation to Jordan considering his criminal record based on false prosecution and his fear of his former XXXX who has an incriminating video of him XXXX XXXX, thus failing to consider the totality of his risk profile considering all of the grounds cumulatively. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in concluding that he does not face discrimination amounting to persecution as a Palestinian in Jordan. Finally, the Appellant submits that the RPD member \"has personal problems with Palestinians\"1 which I have considered as an allegation of bias against the RPD Member. The Appellant has filed new evidence and seeks an oral hearing on the appeal.\n[5] I have conducted an independent assessment. In so doing, I have considered the Record, the Appellant's evidence including his testimony, and his submissions on appeal. For reasons that follow, I find that the Appellant's allegations of bias are without merit. Further, I find that the RPD's overall assessment of the Appellant's credibility was correct and that he has not established on a balance of probabilities that he faces a risk of harm as defined in subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). Further, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution as a Palestinian in Jordan. In sum, I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[6] The following is a summary of the Appellant's allegations from his BOC form and narrative.\n[7] The Appellant is a citizen of Jordan. His mother was born in Jordan, while his father was born in Palestine. The Appellant was born in Saudi Arabia but has no entitlement to Saudi citizenship. He alleges that as a Palestinian he is treated as a second-class citizen in Jordan.\n[8] The Appellant attended university in Jordan, XXXX XXXX to attend a XXXX XXXX XXXX He has a bachelors' degree in XXXX and a diploma in XXXX.\n[9] In 2007\/2008 the Appellant became involved with a woman whose parents were opposed to their relationship. The parents forced the woman to lodge false charges of assault against him. In XXXX 2008 he was convicted of assault in Jordan.\n[10] From 2012 to 2015 the Appellant worked in Saudi Arabia as a XXXX XXXX for a company. In 2015, he changed employment and began working for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX) as an XXXX with various positions including XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He reported to a XXXX, MYA-S.2\n[11] In XXXX 2017, the XXXX sent the Appellant to XXXX XXXX XXXX to pick-up a XXXX for transport back to Jordan. The Appellant told the contact in XXXX, MA, that he wanted to have the XXXX XXXX by a XXXX. MA told him that the XXXX was stolen and loaded with money, and that his employer was involved in money laundering and drug and arms smuggling. The Appellant called the XXXX and told him what MA had reported. MYA-S confirmed the money laundering story but told him not to worry about signing for the XXXX. The Appellant refused to take the XXXX back to Jordan as instructed.\n[12] When the Appellant returned to Saudi Arabia, MYA-S questioned why the Appellant had not signed for the XXXX and attempted to get him involved in the money laundering operations of the business, telling him he would be protected by the company's contacts in the Saudi Arabian government and that he would become a partner of the business.\n[13] The Appellant alleges that MYA-S tried again to recruit him to engage in the company's illegal activities. MYA-S came to his house and told the Appellant that he would be sent to XXXX, XXXX in the United States (US) to sign for two XXXX, one destined for Jordan and the other to Saudi Arabia. The Appellant understood the XXXX would contain cash. MYA-S told him he needed to do what was being demanded of him. The Appellant believed that the company could have him killed if he refused. He also believed that he was at risk in Saudi Arabia as his status there was temporary, and in Jordan, because MYA-S, a Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship, was married to a Jordanian woman, had a business in Jordan and was influential.\n[14] The Appellant agreed to go to XXXX with the intention of fleeing to Canada once in the US. MYA-S had bribed the Appellant with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Appellant went on the XXXX and then fled to Canada.\n[15] The Appellant alleges that he fears MYA-S for failing to comply with the demand that he participates in money laundering activities. He alleges that he also fears that MYA-S would disclose to the Saudi authorities that he XXXX XXXX XXXX with MYA-S and his friend, H.A.S, the manager of XXXX XXXX in Saudi Arabia. The Appellant alleges that he XXXX with these men and had picked-up the XXXX XXXX for them. He alleges he did not know what the XXXX was when the men put it XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and took a video while he was XXXX XXXX.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[16] I can only accept new evidence that: arose after the RPD rejection of the claim; or was not reasonably available at the time of the rejection of the claim; or one could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the rejection of the claim.3 If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.4\n[17] The Appellant presents as new evidence: (i) a WhatsApp message exchange dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, between the Appellant and \"XXXX XXXX\" who the Appellant indicates is MYA-S, translated; (ii) email correspondence with his Counsel at the RPD dated May 31, 2022; and (iii) the Appellant's unsworn affidavit reviewing the evidence in (i) above.5\n[18] I note that the Appellant made submissions regarding the admissibility of the proposed new evidence under both subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, and Rule 29 of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) Rules. The Appellant did not submit any evidence after the perfection of the appeal and therefore I have not considered Rule 29. Rather, I have assessed whether the evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and the Singh\/Raza test.\nEvidence that is rejected\n[19] Item (iii) the Appellant's unsworn affidavit repeats the contents of the WhatsApp messages above and indicates that he told his Counsel about them on May 31, 2022, as per item (ii) above. He states that his Counsel asked him to give her a copy which she would have translated and sent to the RPD but that he could not afford to pay a translator so he did not send it.\n[20] The Appellant's affidavit itself does not contain new information; rather he provides submissions as to the relevance of the WhatsApp exchange, why he included a series of untruthful statements in his WhatsApp reply to MYA-S and why he did not provide the WhatsApp exchange prior to the RPD rejection of the claim. The affidavit does not contain new evidence and will not be accepted as such. However, I have considered the affidavit as submissions.\n[21] In addition, a Wikipedia entry on \"XXXX in Saudi Arabia\" appears in the Appeal Record.6 The Appellant has not identified it as new evidence or provided any submissions on how it meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, such as why it was not provided prior to the RPD rejection of the claim given that the Appellant's evidence is that he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Saudi Arabia, nor does he explain how the document meets the Singh\/Raza requirements of newness, credibility, and relevance. As such, it is not accepted as new evidence.\n[22] Finally, a document appears in the Appeal Record that was not submitted into evidence at the RPD which sets out arguments about what occurred during the Appellant's Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) interviews.7 I have not accepted this document as new evidence but I have considered it as submissions on the appeal.\nEvidence that is accepted\n[23] The Appellant submits that he did not file the WhatsApp message prior to the rejection of his claim because he could not afford to pay an interpreter. This is not reflected in the email, item (iii) above. In the email, the Appellant asks his Counsel for an update, advises her that he still does not have a renewed work permit, has no access to healthcare, and that MYA-S got his cellphone number and contacted him. He asks for Counsel's advice on whether he should change his number and his information on social media platforms. The Counsel's reply email is not reproduced in full. The portion that is included in item (iii) does not address the issue of the translation of the WhatsApp message.\n[24] Nonetheless based on these documents I accept the Appellant's submission that the WhatsApp message was not reasonably available prior to the RPD rejection of the claim because he could not afford the translation of the document, and the correspondence with his Counsel confirms that he did not have a work permit, and therefore lacked the funds to pay for translation. In these circumstances, I find items (ii) and (iii) meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. Having reviewed the WhatsApp messages, I accept that they appear to be messages sent on the WhatsApp platform between the Appellant and his alleged agent of harm. The Appellant has provided a translation of them by a member in good standing of the Society of Translators and Interpreters of British Colombia. The emails appear to be correspondence between the Appellant and his former Counsel's office. I, therefore, find that the WhatsApp messages and email exchange meet the Singh\/Raza requirements of credibility and relevance. They are accepted as new evidence.\n[25] The evidence I have accepted does not raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellant, nor does it justify allowing or rejecting the claim. As such, the requirements for the conduct of an oral hearing set out in subsection 110(6) of the IRPA are not met and no oral hearing can be held.\nANALYSIS\n[26] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.8\nThe Appellant is not excluded under Article 1F(b)\n[27] Based on my independent analysis of the Record before me and the Appellant's evidence and testimony, I agree with the RPD's conclusion that there is no credible evidence to support a finding that the Appellant has committed a serious non-political crime, and thus he is not excluded under Article 1F(b). I agree with and adopt paragraphs 27 through 38 of the RPD Decision which address the exclusion issue.\nAllegations of bias are without merit\n[28] Before proceeding further, I will address the Appellant's allegations of bias vis-a-vis the RPD Member.\n[29] A claimant or appellant is entitled to have their claim or appeal determined by an impartial and independent decision-maker. The duties of an impartial decision-maker include discretion, independence, objectivity, and impartiality. The decision-maker is required to exercise the discretion conferred by the statute. Decision-makers should be independent from those who appoint them and pay their salary. Based on my analysis of the Appeal Memorandum, the Appellant is not challenging the RPD panel's discretion and independence, but rather her impartiality.\n[30] A decision-maker must act with objectivity and impartiality, in other words, without bias. Bias is defined as a \"...preconceived opinion; a predisposition to decide a cause or an issue in a certain way, which does not leave the mind perfectly open to conviction.\"9 The test for bias was articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada as follows:\nWhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that the [decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.10\n[31] The Appellant submits that the RPD Member \"has personal problems with Palestinians.\"11 To support his assertion, he states that she failed to note that the Appellant is listed on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) card he filed as evidence, and that the card verifies his status as a refugee.12 I accept that in the Decision the RPD noted that the Appellant's father is listed in the card but failed to indicate that the Appellant too is listed there, although she plainly recognized this when reviewing the document with the Appellant at the hearing. I find that nothing turns on this oversight. It is clear from the Decision that the panel was aware that the Appellant is of Palestinian origin, and is also a citizen of Jordan, which is not disputed by the Appellant. The Appellant submits that as a Palestinian Jordanian citizen, he is nonetheless a refugee, and faces discrimination amounting to persecution. While the Appellant is listed on the UNRWA card, and there is no dispute that there are differences drawn between Palestinians and \"East Bankers\" in Jordan, there is no evidence that the Appellant, a Jordanian citizen who is a professional XXXX and highly educated, lived in a refugee camp, or would live in a refugee camp if he returned to Jordan. The RPD noted that Palestinians living in refugee camps may face discrimination in Jordan, but this is not the Appellant's situation.\n[32] Further, in conducting my independent assessment, I have reviewed the Record, including the audio transcript of the two sittings, March 2, 2022, and March 4, 2022. In my view, there is nothing in the Record that would lead an informed person to think that it was more likely than not that the RPD panel whether consciously or unconsciously would not decide fairly for any reason, including in light of the Appellant's profile as a Palestinian. The Member's conduct during the hearing was appropriate and respectful. She asked relevant questions and provided the Appellant an opportunity to fully present his case. At no point did the Appellant's Counsel who was present throughout the RPD hearing object to the conduct or questioning of the RPD Member. I recognize that there were instances where the RPD Member became frustrated as she was of the view that the Appellant had not answered the question posed, however, I find the general tenor of the hearing was respectful and appropriate.\n[33] I have considered the RPD findings on the allegation of discrimination amounting to persecution which was based on a consideration of the Appellant's personal circumstances together with the objective evidence. The RPD analysis of this issue is detailed and considered. Having reviewed the Record, the Appellant's evidence including his testimony, and the objective evidence, I agree with the RPD assessment that the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution as a Palestinian in Jordan. My reasons on this issue are further addressed below.\n[34] In conclusion, I do not find that an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through, would think that it is more likely than not that the RPD panel, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly. I find the Appellant's submission that the RPD is biased or has a problem with Palestinians to be without merit.\nSubmissions not related to credibility\n[35] Before addressing credibility, which is determinative of the appeal, I will review certain portions of the Appellant's submissions that do not pertain to credibility.\n[36] The Appellant's submissions are based in part on the submissions made by his Counsel on the first RAD appeal in May 2021. As such, some of the submissions are responsive to the decision by the first RPD panel that heard his claim.13 The determinative issue before the first RPD panel was Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). In his Appeal Memorandum on the present appeal, the Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of his risk in the proposed IFA and in Jordan generally and erred in its determination on the second prong as to the reasonableness of relocation to the IFA. The second RPD panel did not address IFA because it did not find the Appellant's allegations credible. For reasons set forth here, I agree with the determination by the second RPD panel that the Appellant has not presented sufficient credible evidence that he would face a serious possibility of persecution if he returned to Jordan. As such, it is not necessary for me to address IFA or the Appellant's submissions on IFA.\n[37] The Appellant also makes submissions that are responsive to the issue of exclusion under Article 1F(b) of the Convention, which is not challenged on the appeal since it was decided in the Appellant's favour. However, I understand that the Appellant may be making these arguments to establish that while the purchase of XXXX is not criminalized in Canada, it is considered a serious crime in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, in order to demonstrate the peril he alleges he would be in if the XXXX disclosed this activity to the authorities in either country.\n[38] The Appellant also disputes the accuracy of the CBSA interview notes regarding the false prosecution and states that he was not claiming asylum based on fear of his former girlfriend's family which he alleges was behind what he considers to be a false prosecution. The RPD confirmed that the Appellant feared harm from MYA-S, not the former girlfriend's family, and the Appellant has not challenged this finding on appeal. Therefore, it is not necessary for me to further address this submission.\nThe Appellant's credibility\n[39] The Appellant's submissions generally, and on the issue of credibility, include long excerpts from the RPD Decision and are somewhat disjointed. I have carefully reviewed and considered his submissions, which may be summarized as follows: the RPD erred in making peripheral and unclear findings of credibility, failed to consider the totality of the evidence and rejected key pieces of his testimony and evidence, ignored evidence that explains apparent inconsistencies, and then made negative credibility findings; incorrectly made negative credibility findings based on omissions in his BOC since there is no positive obligation on claimants to update the BOC, and failed to consider his overall risk profile in assessing whether he would face a risk if he returned to Jordan.\n[40] The Appellant also asserts that the RPD erred in determining that if he returned to Jordan, he does not face a serious possibility of discrimination amounting to persecution as a Palestinian. This issue is addressed following my findings on the Appellant's credibility.\n[41] Having considered the totality of the evidence in the Record and the Appellant's testimony at the RPD, I agree with the RPD assessment that the Appellant confirmed in his testimony that he feared one person, his XXXX. I also agree with the RPD assessment that the Appellant's claim revolves around a relatively small fact pattern concerning the Appellant's alleged refusal to participate in two efforts to import XXXX with money in them, from XXXX, and then XXXX. While I disagree with some of the RPD credibility findings which I will address first, overall, I agree with the RPD assessment that the Appellant has not established his allegations that he would face harm by the XXXX, as defined in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, on a balance of probabilities, if he were to return to Jordan.\nMaterial Contradictions: when the Appellant learned about the deal in XXXX and whether the Appellant drove with the XXXX or sat in the car\n[42] I find that the RPD erred in its assessment of the evidence on these issues, and I cannot uphold its findings.\n[43] The RPD impugned the Appellant's credibility because at his first RPD hearing before the former presiding RPD Member, he stated that he drove in the XXXX's car in Jordan when he was informed of the XXXX plan, whereas during the March 2, 2022 sitting of the second RPD hearing, he stated that he just sat in the car, which is supported by a letter filed by the Appellant's brother.14 The Appellant explained that when he said he had \"ridden\" in the car with MYA-S, he meant that he sat with MYA-S in the car, that the interpreter at the second RPD hearing made an error and started to say, correctly, that he \"went\" in the car but changed it to \"rode\" which is an incorrect translation of what he said in Arabic. I am not in a position to comment on the Arabic interpretation at the hearing and the Appellant has not alleged that the interpretation at the hearing was a problem in general. However, I accept his explanation on a balance of probabilities because it is clear in the audio recording that the interpreter first said the Appellant \"went\" in the car and then changed the interpretation to say he \"rode\" in the car.\n[44] Further, I cannot uphold the RPD findings on the apparent contradiction regarding where the Appellant learned of the XXXX plan (Saudi Arabia or Jordan). The RPD determination on this issue largely hinges on its interpretation of paragraph 7 of the Appellant's narrative and whether the Appellant states that he learned of the XXXX plan in Saudi Arabia or Jordan. The Appellant testified that after the XXXX incident, MYA-S told him, in Saudi Arabia, that he would have a \"second chance\" to participate again in a similar scheme, but that he was not advised of the XXXX scheme until both men were in Jordan for the Eid holidays. I find that the Appellant's testimony is not inconsistent with paragraph 7 of the narrative. On my reading of paragraph 7 it is ambiguous as to where the XXXX scheme was disclosed. The Appellant does state that the XXXX \"actually came to my house in Jordan to give me directions about the XXXX XXXX job.\"15 When the Appellant states in paragraph 7 that he was to be given another chance to participate, it is not clear where that was communicated. I recognize, as noted by the RPD, that the Appellant agreed with the CBSA Officer Christopoulos who asked if the Appellant learned of the XXXX plan in Saudi Arabia. When asked to explain this discrepancy, the Appellant repeated his testimony that he was told in Saudi Arabia he would be given a second chance but learned of the plan in Jordan. Given the ambiguity in paragraph 7 of the narrative, I find it was an error to draw a negative inference on this matter.\nVague and vacillating testimony\n[45] The Appellant submits that the RPD credibility findings cast a nebulous cloud of unreliability and were generally unclear or peripheral. I do not agree with this overall characterization of the RPD findings as it made a series of specific credibility findings based on material omissions and inconsistencies, which are correct, as discussed further below.\n[46] The RPD did make a general observation that the Appellant's testimony was often vague and vacillating and cited a specific example discussed below. Having carefully reviewed the Appellant's testimony, I find that there are multiple examples of the Appellant's vacillating testimony, whereby he provided testimony to support one aspect of his allegations, while simultaneously contradicting or undercutting another allegation, from which I draw a negative credibility inference.\n[47] For example, to support his allegations respecting the risk posed by the XXXX, the Appellant testified that he feared going on the XXXX because he feared the XXXX might have a surprise for him in the form of someone on the XXXX who would harm him. When asked why he would go on the XXXX anyway, the Appellant stated that it was safe actually, because there were 3000 people XXXX XXXX and thus too large a crowd in which he could be targeted.\n[48] Another example is the Appellant's evidence regarding what was to happen after the XXXX. The Appellant insisted that the XXXX through his employer had made and paid for his travel arrangements. He claimed it was part of the plan for him to go to a hotel and await instructions, however, he admitted that he did not have a hotel booking for after the XXXX. His explanation for the lack of a hotel booking was because someone was to pick him up after the XXXX and take him to a XXXX to deal with the XXXX and that he would be staying there, contradicting his allegation that he was to first go to a hotel. He stated that the XXXX told him in advance he would be staying at a XXXX, and he feared going to a XXXX because it was not a public place and thus would be unsafe. As discussed further below, there is nothing about this plan in the Appellant's BOC narrative. I find based on this contradictory and vacillating testimony, coupled with the BOC omission and absence of corroborating digital communications or threats after the Appellant left XXXX, that there was no plan for the Appellant to arrange for a shipment of XXXX to launder money, as alleged, on a balance of probabilities. I find it more likely than not that the Appellant added the allegation about going to a private XXXX location as an embellishment, to suggest a higher level of risk to his safety.\n[49] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in paragraphs 105 and 106 of its Decision and that there is corroborating evidence to indicate that XXXX paid for his travel to XXXX, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and for the XXXX. Even if XXXX paid for his travel as claimed by the Appellant, these documents do not corroborate his allegations that he was to sign for XXXX that were full of cash, at the behest of the XXXX and therefore I give them some limited weight as they support that the Appellant travelled to XXXX and went on a XXXX. However, I note that these documents also run counter to the Appellant's argument that part of the overall arrangement was that he was to go to a hotel and await instructions because if this was the case, as discussed above, it is reasonable to expect that the hotel booking would be included in the arrangements.\n[50] I note that the RPD drew a negative inference because the Appellant offered vacillating testimony on how he was to learn the details of the XXXX XXXX arrangements once he arrived in the US-by email or other digital communication. I find the exchange on this specific issue included repeated miscommunications between the RPD panel and the Appellant. However, the salient point from this exchange is that the Appellant testified that he was to receive instructions via a phone call, WhatsApp, or Facebook communication, and later testified that he had no evidence of a missed phone call or WhatsApp or Facebook communication and thus is unable to corroborate his allegation. This is further addressed below.\n[51] In sum, I agree that the Appellant offered vacillating and inconsistent testimony on material allegations, from which I draw a negative credibility inference.\nMaterial Omissions: threats and blackmail; whether the Appellant received multiple calls and messages from his XXXX after he fled XXXX\n[52] The RPD found that the Appellant's BOC narrative contained material omissions. I agree with the RPD analysis on the omissions. I find the omissions from the BOC, coupled with a lack of probative evidence to support the Appellant's allegations that he faces an ongoing threat of harm from the XXXX, are central to my determination that the Appellant has not demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that he would face an ongoing risk of harm from the XXXX if he returned to Jordan. My reasons follow.\n[53] The RPD drew a negative inference because the Appellant did not include in his narrative the following testimony: when he met with the MYA-S in Jordan, he threatened to use the video of the Appellant XXXX XXXX XXXX against him, threatened that he would be on a blacklist, and the family of the woman he was engaged to in Jordan would not accept him in their family; and he received multiple threatening communications from the XXXX after he fled XXXX. The RPD also drew a negative inference because the Appellant did not include in the narrative that he fled XXXX because he was terrified MYA-S or his agents would kill him and that he would be killed at the XXXX where he was supposed to pick up the XXXX. There is no mention of the XXXX in the BOC narrative, which the Appellant testified was of particular concern to him as it was a non-public place.\n[54] The Appellant explained that he did not know he ought to have included the details about the threats of harm and blackmail in the BOC narrative, an explanation rejected by the RPD because he had experienced Counsel, who had assisted him with making other amendments to his narrative. The Appellant submits that his Counsel only helped with the last two pages of his narrative because he was detained while he was preparing the first part with the help of an interpreter whose job is not to assist with the BOC. The Appellant submitted that his Counsel at the first RPD hearing said that the reason the BOC does not include all the information is that the Appellant was in custody, however, this does not explain why these allegations were not included in the additional narrative prepared after the Appellant was released from custody and filed by the Appellant's Counsel on the first RPD proceeding.16 Like the RPD, I do not accept the Appellant's explanation as reasonable.\n[55] I find that the RPD was correct to make a negative credibility finding regarding these omissions from the BOC. These omissions share a common theme: they all relate to the Appellant's alleged ongoing fear of reprisal and harm from MYA-S, which is central to his allegations. I agree with and adopt the RPD findings regarding these omissions, set out in paragraphs 82 to 86, and 88 to 91 of its Decision. I find that these omissions undermine the credibility of the Appellant's allegation that he fears harm and reprisal from MYA-S if he were to return to Jordan.\n[56] The Appellant alleged that he feared that the XXXX would use the XXXX video as blackmail to force him to participate in money laundering. He stated this fear but did not set out any specific instances of actual threats of blackmail in his narrative. When the RPD questioned him on this, the Appellant testified that he had been threatened with blackmail in Jordan when the XXXX plan was communicated, as described above. The Appellant's alleged fear of the XXXX and the latter's use of this video is central to his allegations and yet he failed to include this highly material allegation in his BOC narrative, referring to it only when the RPD noted an absence of any allegations of particular instances of blackmail. I draw a negative credibility inference from this omission.\n[57] Similarly, the Appellant does not state in the BOC narrative that he fled XXXX because he feared that the XXXX or his agents would kill him. Again, this is a material allegation that goes to the heart of his claim that he has a forward-facing risk of harm, yet it was omitted from the BOC. I make a negative credibility finding from this omission.\n[58] When the RPD asked the Appellant if the XXXX ever acted on his threats of harm, he testified that the XXXX withheld the consent required by the Saudi Arabian authorities so that he could apply for a new job, with XXXX. This is a material allegation-an alleged instance of the XXXX exercising power and control over the Appellant-and yet it was omitted from the BOC. When asked why this was omitted, the Appellant stated that he did not know he had to put this allegation in his BOC narrative and had mentioned it to a CBSA officer. I draw a negative inference from this omission as it is highly material to the Appellant's claim that the XXXX threatened to harm him and poses a forward-facing risk if he returned to Jordan.\n[59] The Appellant also submits that the omitted testimony was covered in his interviews with the CBSA and therefore they were otherwise provided in the Record and should not be considered omissions. I have reviewed those interviews and they do not set out the detailed allegations to which the Appellant testified regarding the XXXX trip and the threat to use the XXXX video, and do not assist to explain the omissions from the BOC. In the interview with Officer Christopoulos, the Appellant states that he was to go to XXXX to pick up XXXX containing money. He said that the \"exact episode of XXXX was about to be replicated in XXXX. I was told when I take the flight to XXXX airport, go to a hotel from there, somebody will contact me and introduce himself to me, exactly the way which has been transpired in my travel to XXXX XXXX\"17 The Appellant goes on to tell the officer that the only person he heard from upon arrival in XXXX was MYA-S who contacted him to confirm he had arrived. The Appellant then stated that MYA-S had told him that the call would come to the hotel after the XXXX, but he did not go to a hotel nor receive a call and fled to XXXX. He did not tell the officer that the deal was to take place at a XXXX.\n[60] In his interview with Officer Wunderlich, the Appellant stated that he did not refuse to go to XXXX because MYA-S had videos of him XXXX XXXX XXXX, however, he did not state that they blackmailed him with threats to use the video against him if he did not go, as alleged in his testimony.18\n[61] These material omissions are coupled with an absence of corroborating evidence to support the Appellant's allegations that he received threats of harm from MYA-S after he fled XXXX having failed to deal with the XXXX.\n[62] As referenced briefly above, the Appellant testified that he expected to receive electronic communication regarding the plan with the XXXX in XXXX at approximately 5:30 to 6:30 pm following the conclusion of the XXXX at 5:00 pm, but he turned his phone off. The RPD invited him to file any evidence of having received such a communication. On the second hearing day, the Appellant confirmed that he did not have a missed voicemail, WhatsApp or Facebook call during these hours, or other evidence of electronic communication of these plans or communication regarding his failure to follow through on the plans regarding the XXXX. The Appellant therefore did not proffer any corroborating evidence of a digital communication after the XXXX either communicating the plan or asking why he was not responding to communications as expected.\n[63] The Appellant testified that he received threats through Facebook 3 or 4 times. Having reviewed the Appellant's Facebook and WhatsApp messages in the Record, nothing in those communications indicates that he was being threatened. Further, the Appellant remained employed by XXXX for some weeks after he fled XXXX, and as noted by the RPD, he continued to be in touch with his former employer which more likely than not explains the ongoing contact.\n[64] The WhatsApp messages dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, accepted as new evidence appear to have been initiated by the XXXX (identified as \"XXXX XXXX\" on Facebook). The XXXX asks \"How are you\" at the beginning. He asks the Appellant to call him. The Appellant then sets out what has happened to him in Canada through the refugee application process. In his appeal submissions, he admits that he embellished these. The XXXX does not threaten him in the message. He states that they will talk when the Appellant is back in Jordan. I do not find that this WhatsApp exchange of messages supports the Appellant's allegations that he faces a risk of harm by the XXXX if he returned to Jordan.\n[65] The Appellant alleges that he received a threatening audio message from H A-S and that the reference to \"Iraq\" in H A-S's message is a reference to the XXXX.19 The message from H A-S. is cryptic, referring to \"Iraq\" and \"Carrefour.\" The Appellant has not provided evidence to explain how this message is probative of his allegation that he was being threatened by the XXXX or H A-S.\n[66] In addition to the lack of evidence of threats of blackmail before or after the XXXX trip, there is a lack of concrete evidence regarding the power and position of the alleged agent of harm, MYA-S, and as I have found above, I have drawn a negative inference regarding the alleged threats of blackmail before the XXXX trip given their omission from the BOC narrative.\n[67] The Appellant testified that MYA-S is a Palestinian Jordanian, married to a Jordanian woman. The Appellant has made general allegations that MYA-S is an individual with power and influence, and despite being Palestinian, has \"wasta\" (meaning access to power and influence) in Jordan, because he has money. However, he has provided no specific evidence to support this. While the Appellant suggested it was significant that MYA-S's wife is Jordanian, he provided no evidence about her family or about how they might wield power against him. The Appellant testified that he did not know exactly how big MYA-S's power in Jordan was but then said when he learned that the XXXX from XXXX would enter through customs, he knew his power was \"very strong.\"20 When asked to explain how he knows this, the Appellant stated that MYA-S has contacts in the Jordanian customs authority. I do not find this to be probative of the Appellant's claim that MYA-S has significant power or influence in Jordan such that he would have power over the Appellant. The Appellant has not explained how contacts in the customs authority would translate to authority and influence over him. Further, if MYA-S wields influence and power in Jordan, one might expect there to be instances where he has done so to affect others, however, the Appellant provided no examples of MYA-S's influential, threatening, or violent behaviour towards anyone else. In sum, the Appellant alleges that MYA-S is untouchable and above the law in Jordan due to his power and influence but has provided no concrete evidence of this.\n[68] Furthermore, when asked by the RPD, the Appellant had no information that MYA-S is connected to a broader criminal organization (and the Appellant specifically denied any knowledge that the XXXX company, which he states MYA-S left after the Appellant came to Canada, is itself involved in criminal activity).\n[69] The Appellant alleges further that MYA-S fears him because he knows about his illegal activities, yet the Appellant claims that he himself has no power and influence in Jordan, while he asserts that MYA-S is above the law. I find this allegation to be speculative. There is no evidence to support it and it contradicts the Appellant's own allegations about the power dynamic. I also note that the Appellant allegedly has information about MYA-S's criminal activities and drug use and therefore is implicated in any narrative he might disclose about the Appellant.\n[70] Finally, the Appellant confirmed that he has no evidence that MYA-S has contacted or threatened his family in Jordan since he fled to Canada.\n[71] In sum, there is no credible evidence that the Appellant was blackmailed or threatened by MYA-S at any time, including before or after the XXXX trip, nor is there credible evidence that MYA-S poses an ongoing threat of harm to the Appellant if he returned to Jordan.\n[72] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred by failing to address a serious issue raised regarding his former Counsel and an interpreter putting fake evidence in his file. I have examined the relevant portion of the audio recording of the hearing.21 The RPD asked if the Appellant had reported the issue regarding potential fraud by his former Counsel and the interpreter. The Appellant's Counsel stated that this was a criminal matter, that the former Counsel was facing serious criminal charges and this matter was minor compared with the charges the prosecution decided to proceed on. Counsel confirmed that the allegations against the interpreter had not yet been reported to the RPD, and the RPD panel stated that she would report it. I find no fault in the RPD's handling of this matter. The former Counsel's alleged placement of false evidence in the Record and the interpreter's alleged involvement was not relevant to the RPD assessment of the Appellant's claim, nor is it relevant on appeal.\n[73] In conclusion, I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant faces a risk of harm as defined in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, by his alleged agent of harm.\nDiscrimination amounting to persecution as a Palestinian in Jordan\n[74] The RPD concluded that while persons of Palestinian origin face some discrimination in Jordan, the level of discrimination does not, even when considered cumulatively, and in the context of the Appellant's particular circumstances, rise to a well-founded fear of persecution for persons bearing his profile, namely a highly educated Jordanian citizen who does not live in a refugee camp, who is of Palestinian origin.\n[75] The Appellant submits that the RPD failed to take into account his entire profile in determining whether he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Jordan. He notes that not only his father, who was born in Palestine, but his entire family including the Appellant himself, is listed on the UNWRA card, which he asserts demonstrates that notwithstanding his Jordanian citizenship, there is still racism in Jordan, he is identified as a Palestinian, and is subject to unequal treatment. He submits that in addition to his allegations of discrimination in education and employment for example, the RPD failed to consider that he has a criminal record based on false prosecution, that the family of his former girlfriend was able to influence the exercise of state power against him, and that Palestinians in Jordan have little \"wasta.\"\n[76] I note that Palestinians in Jordan bear differing statuses. I have not considered the treatment of Palestinians in the categories of \"ex-Gazan,\" or Palestinians who have fled the Syrian civil war, who may face persecution in Jordan, as the Appellant does not fit these profiles.22 Based on the evidence in the Record, the Appellant is in the group of Palestinians and their children who migrated to Jordan and the Jordan-controlled West Bank after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and received full citizenship.23 The Appellant holds a Jordanian passport and Jordanian national identity number, which is noted on his passport.24 According to the documentary evidence, Palestinians can be in possession of documents other than those issued by UNRWA, including Palestinians with Jordanian citizenship and the right to a Jordanian passport. UNRWA operates two forms of eligibility-the eligibility to register with UNRWA and the eligibility to receive UNRWA services.25 There is insufficient evidence before me to determine into which category the Appellant falls, but regardless there is no dispute that he possesses Jordanian citizenship and a national identity number. Based on the objective evidence including the June 2020 Danish Immigration Service report on Palestinian refugees in Jordan,26 individuals such as the Appellant who have a full passport and national identity number are considered Jordanian citizens and are not at risk of having their citizenship revoked.\n[77] I have considered the Appellant's submissions, the Record, and the audio-recording of the RPD hearing. I have also considered the evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Jordan and for the Palestinian Territory (Occupied) regarding the situation of Palestinians in Jordan. The issues, evidence, and arguments before me are the same as those before the RPD. Based on my independent analysis, I agree with and adopt the RPD's findings in paragraphs 117 to 126 of its Decision and I conclude, as did the RPD, that the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution in Jordan on account of his Palestinian heritage. In paragraphs 119 to 123 the RPD canvasses and correctly summarizes the objective evidence regarding education, property ownership, business activity, and social discrimination in respect of Palestinian citizens in Jordan.\n[78] The documentary evidence27 indicates that while Palestinians in Jordan may be treated differently than non-Palestinian Jordanians, and face what the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) describes as \"low level\" official discrimination in some areas, I do not find that they face systemic discrimination amounting to persecution in Jordan. For example, while Palestinians are underpopulated in public sector employment, they dominate in the private sector.28 There is no evidence in the Record to establish on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant faced discrimination in employment in Jordan amounting to persecution. Jordanian Palestinians are entitled to the same healthcare and have the same health status as other Jordanians, can own property, and can attend public and private schools.29 There does seem to be discrimination against Palestinians in accessing post-secondary education and the Appellant indicated that he had to XXXX XXXX for his university education, but in my view, this does not rise to the level of persecution. He was able to complete a XXXX degree and a certificate in XXXX in Jordan.\n[79] I recognize that there is evidence in the NDP that Palestinians may face discrimination in terms of state protection.30 The Appellant submits that his false prosecution initiated by the family of his former girlfriend demonstrates that he was discriminated against as a Palestinian. There is insufficient evidence on the Record for me to find on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant was subject to false prosecution, nor do I find that the evidence on the Record demonstrates on a balance of probabilities that he was prosecuted because he is Palestinian. The incident occurred in 2008. The Appellant was able to complete his university education thereafter and obtain a further educational certificate. I do not find that the evidence in the Record on this issue supports a finding that the Appellant was subject to discrimination rising to persecution or to a finding that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of discrimination amounting to persecution if he returned to Jordan.\n[80] In sum, I find that the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of discrimination amounting to persecution if he returned to Jordan.\nCONCLUSION\n[81] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nSoraya Farha\nSoraya Farha\nMarch 23, 2023\nDate\n1 Appellant's Record, at p. 46.\n2 Personal identifiers have been removed, except where necessary to explain the reasoning of the decision.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended, at ss. 110(4).\n4 Singh v.

They claim to fear the Punjab police, and members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress party (Congress) and Shiromani Akali Dal-Badal (SAD-B) due to the principal Appellant's support for Shiromani Akali Dal-Amritsar (SAD-A). The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the Appellants have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Kolkata and New Delhi and rejected their claim in a decision dated June 23, 2022.\n[2] The Appellants appeal the RPD's decision to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).1 The Appellants ask that the RAD set aside the decision of the RPD and substitute its own determination that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. In the alternative, the Appellants request that the matter be referred to a different panel of the RPD for redetermination.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The principal Appellant is a 46-year-old Sikh man from Punjab. He is married to the associate Appellant, aged 38, and they are the parents of the minor Appellants, ages 15 and 11.\n[5] The adult Appellants are members of the SAD-A which advocates for the independent Sikh home state of Khalistan. As members of SAD-A, the principal Appellant engaged in activities such as putting up posters, attending demonstrations and going from village to village speaking to small groups of people. As noted by the RPD, he was not a leader of SAD-A, and has never stood for election. He was also openly critical of the corrupt policies of the other political parties. Due to their support of SAD-A, it is alleged the adult Appellants were threatened and assaulted by members of opposing political parties.\n[6] The principal Appellant was arrested on false charges of assaulting a community member in 2014. He was eventually acquitted in 2017. The adult Appellants were also detained by the police in 2014 on allegations of disturbing the public peace. This issue was resolved when the Appellants agreed to a one-year peace bond. It is alleged that the associate Appellant's detention resulted in her loss of honour in Indian society.\n[7] It is for these reasons that the Appellants left India in XXXX 2018, and made claims for protection in September 2019.\n[8] Their hearing before the RPD was held on May 26, 2022.\nORAL HEARING\n[9] The Appellants have not requested an oral hearing, and the legislative criteria for an oral hearing before the RAD have not been met. Oral hearings can only be convened by the RAD when new evidence which is admissible on appeal raises a serious issue with respect to the Appellants' credibility that is central to the decision, and if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claims.2\n[10] No new evidence has been presented and therefore an oral hearing cannot be held.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[11] The standard of correctness applies to this appeal as set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica.3 This requires an independent assessment of the refugee claim to determine whether the RPD was correct in its findings and determinations.4 While deference can be afforded to the RPD on specific issues when it enjoys a meaningful advantage over the RAD in making findings of fact or mixed fact and law, such an advantage does not arise in the present case. Upon my review of the transcript, I find the RPD decision is based solely on evidence found in the record.\nANALYSIS\n[12] Following my independent assessment of the record, including reading the transcript of the RPD proceedings, I agree with the RPD and find the Appellants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. I find the Appellants have a viable IFA in New Delhi and Kolkata. In making my decision, I have considered the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the IRB.5\nIFA\n[13] In Rasaratnam,6 the Court of Appeal held that, with respect to the burden of proof, once the issue of an IFA is raised, the onus is on the claimants to show that they do not have an IFA.\n[14] In order to find that the Appellants have a viable IFA in India, I must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that they would not be subjected personally to a danger of torture, or to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA, and that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, to seek refuge there.7 Consequently, if there is a safe haven for the Appellants in their own country, where they would be free of persecution or harm, they are expected to avail themselves of it unless they can show that it is objectively unreasonable for them to do so.\nThere is not a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm to the Appellants in New Delhi or Kolkata\n[15] There can only be a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm if the agents of harm have both the means and the motivation to locate the Appellants in the proposed IFA.8 I find the Appellants have not established that the agents of harm would be motivated to find them in New Delhi or Kolkata.\n[16] India is a large country covering 3 million square kilometres, and has a population of over 1.3 billion people.9 New Delhi has a population of 32 million10 people, and is located approximately XXXX kilometres away from the Appellants' former home in XXXX XXXX. Kolkata has a population of 13.2 million11 people and is located over XXXX XXXX XXXX kilometres away from the Appellants' former home. In saying this, I am aware the court12 has found that population and distance alone are not indications of safety.\nThe Punjab police are not agents of harm\n[17] Before addressing the availability of an IFA, I must identify the agents of harm. The Appellants assert that there are multiple agents of harm including members of opposition political parties, Hindu nationalists, and the Punjab police. For reasons to follow, I find the Appellants have not established that the Punjab police are agents of harm. In the event I am incorrect, I find the Appellants have not established that the Punjab police would be motivated to pursue them in an IFA.\n[18] The RPD correctly noted that India police are subject to political influence, and that corruption exists within Indian law enforcement. It also noted that aside from not acting on the principal Appellant's complainants, there is no evidence that the police have acted inappropriately with the Appellants or have interacted with them at all since 2014. When the police did show an interest in the Appellants, it was at the behest of complaints registered by other private individuals and not because of any law enforcement initiative.\n[19] The Appellants argue that the country condition evidence indicates that the police \"keep track of\" or \"monitor\" Khalistan supporters. They point to country condition evidence which asserts that the police will not admit to arresting people for supporting Khalistan, but rather the police will attribute the arrest to supporting militants or illegal activities or will blame Khalistan supporters for crimes when they cannot find the true perpetrator. This is not what has occurred in the present case. In this case, the evidence indicates that the Appellants had conflict with members of their community. Twice the neighbours registered complaints with the police, and the police responded to those registered complaints.\n[20] The Appellants provided evidence, including documentary evidence, that the principal Appellant had been wrongly accused of an offence in 2012 and was acquitted of the same in 2017. The principal Appellant testified that the charges were laid because \"they\" did not want him speaking at Khalistan rallies. The documentary evidence he provided indicates the charges were unrelated to his political activities. According to the acquittal judgment, the principal Appellant and three other men got into an altercation with a neighbour, XXXX XXXX outside of the dairy. The altercation was alleged to have started after the principal Appellant said bad words to the neighbour's wife, XXXX XXXX. In his defence, the principal Appellant claimed the complaint was the result of a party faction within the village (a faction being a split within a larger group).\n[21] There is no mention of Khalistan, the SAD-A, militant activities, or other illegal activities in the court decision or the First Information Report (FIR) upon which the case was based. The other two accused claimed they were falsely accused because of their affiliation with a milk producer's association. The third accused died before trial. Even if I accept that the principal Appellant was falsely accused by his neighbour, the acquittal documents do not support his assertion that he was falsely accused because of his support for Khalistan. Further, there is no indication that the police were behind any false accusation.\n[22] The adult Appellants were both arrested in 2014. There is no evidence to suggest that the second arrest, which resulted in a peace bond, was related to the principal Appellant's political activities. According to the decision of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, the adult Appellants were accused of abusing, harassing, and threatening XXXX XXXX in 2014, which was bad for the general public. At the initial hearing, the Appellants claimed they were falsely accused and promised to submit proof of the same. At the resumption of the matter in XXXX 2015, the Appellants admitted the accusations against them, and agreed to keep the peace for one year and \"not create any difficulty towards the general public.\" In her decision, the judge deemed no further investigation was needed.\n[23] I find the principal Appellant's acquittal indicates that the local justice system worked as it should and was protective of the Appellant's rights. I also find the resolution of the second matter via a consent peace bond is also evidence that the local justice system is not persecutory.\n[24] Accordingly, I find on a balance of probabilities that the police are not agents of harm and I find they have no interest in the Appellants either in Punjab or an IFA.\nThe principal Appellant's position within SAD-A is insufficient to motivate the agents of harm to pursue them in an IFA\n[25] The RPD found that the principal Appellant was a low-level member of SAD-A and, as such, would not be targeted in an IFA. The Appellants argue that the updated National Documentation Package (NDP) on India indicates that Sikhs who openly call for an independent Khalistan may face violence, threats, and intimidation throughout India.\n[26] The evidence before me indicates that the Appellants had a conflict with members of their community. On two occasions between 2012 and 2014, the neighbours laid a police complaint against the Appellants. On the first occasion, the court found the prosecutor failed to meet the burden of proof. On the second occasion, the Appellants admitted to wrongdoing and the matter was resolved by the issuance of a one-year peace bond.\n[27] Even if I accept that the conflict between the Appellants and members of their community was due to Appellants' allegiance to SAD-A, there is no evidence before me that the agents of harm would be motivated to look for the Appellants in an IFA as they have shown no interest in the Appellants since 2014.\n[28] The Appellants argue that the RPD missed the mark in this regard. They argue it is not an issue of whether the existing agents of harm will search for the Appellants outside of Punjab, but rather whether their vocal support of Khalistan will attract the attention of the authorities and Hindu nationalist parties who are already present in the IFA locations. In other words, the Appellants argue that their Khalistan advocacy will attract the attention of new agents of harm. This argument is speculative. The Appellants have failed to establish that the authorities\/police in their former community have any interest in them, thus, it is speculative to argue that the authorities in an IFA would have any interest in them.\nThere is no evidence that the Appellants faced a risk of harm after the peace bond was issued in 2014\n[29] The adult Appellants were detained in XXXX 2014, and eventually agreed to one-year peace bond in XXXX 2015. In their written evidence, the Appellants did not mention facing any risk of harm after that date and the principal Appellant testified that he had not been detained by the police at any point after 2014.\n[30] When confronted with the lack of evidence of persecution post 2014, the principal Appellant indicated that he had been \"assaulted so many times\" but because these incidents were not documented he was prevented from mentioning them. He also testified, \"[the arrests] kept on happening, [these] things are not recorded, we have not mentioned those because police can arrest without FIR as well.\" The Appellants had legal advice when completing their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and, therefore, I find they would have been advised to include all arrests and all instances of physical assault in their BOC. When the associate Appellant was asked if anything happened to her after 2014, she said that opposition party members, including the people who had previously sought the peace bond, would come to their house, and threaten to kidnap and kill their children. I find the testimony pertaining to ongoing assaults, ongoing arrests, and ongoing threats to kidnap and kill their children, all of which were omitted from the Appellants' written evidence, are embellishments and, therefore, are not demonstrative of an ongoing motivation to pursue the Appellants in an IFA.\nThe agents of harm took no steps to approach the Appellants when they reavailed to India in 2018\n[31] The adult Appellants travelled to Canada in XXXX 2017. The associate Appellant returned to India in XXXX 2017, and the principal Appellant returned to India in XXXX 2018. They remained in India until XXXX 2018. There is no evidence before me that any agent of harm tried to approach the associate Appellant after she reavailed in XXXX 2017. Likewise, there is no evidence before me that any agent of harm tried to approach the principal Appellant after he reavailed in XXXX 2018.\n[32] I find the lack of contact between the agents of harm and the adult Appellants from the dates of their reavailment to the date they finally left India speaks directly to a lack of interest in the Appellants and lack of motivation to locate the Appellants in an IFA.\n[33] Having found the Appellants have failed to establish that the agents of harm would be motivated to look the Appellants in New Delhi or Kolkata, it is not necessary for me to address whether they would have the means to do so.\nIt is reasonable for the Appellants to relocate to New Delhi or Kolkata\n[34] Having found the Appellants have not established that the agents of harm would be motivated to find them in New Delhi or Kolkata, I must now determine whether it would be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for them to relocate there, and I find it would not be.\n[35] The Federal Court of Appeal set a very high threshold for the \"unreasonableness test,\" requiring nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life or safety of the Appellants. Further, there must be actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.13 In other words, the Appellants must present credible evidence that an IFA is untenable.14\nEmployment and Accommodation\n[36] The adult Appellants are reasonably educated. Both adult Appellants have a XXXX XXXX education and are literate. The principal Appellant finished up to Grade XXXX XXXX and the associate Appellant finished Grade XXXX. The principal Appellant claims to have worked as a XXXX XXXX in India. In his Schedule A, he claimed to have worked for over XXXX years as a XXXX XXXX. He has more than XXXX years work experience in Canada as a XXXX XXXX. The associate Appellant has work experience in Canada as a XXXX in a XXXX.\n[37] The adult Appellants are both of working age and there is no evidence before me to indicate they are not healthy.\n[38] I find on a balance of probabilities, given their education and their work histories, the Appellants would be able to find employment in New Delhi and Kolkata. Based on my finding that the Appellants could find work in New Delhi and Kolkata, I also find that they would have the resources needed to secure adequate accommodation.\nLanguage\n[39] The adult Appellants speak Punjabi. From the hearing, I could discern that they have some capacity in English. Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu are commonly spoken in New Delhi.15 In West Bengal the most commonly spoken languages are Bengali, Hindi, and Santali.16 English is considered a subsidiary official language in India and is used for national, political, legal, and commercial communication.17 The court decisions submitted by the Appellants were written in English.\n[40] While I understand that the Appellants will not be able to fully rely on Punjabi in the IFAs, I find they would be able to communicate there as they have done in Canada.\nReligion\n[41] Almost every major Indian city has a Sikh community.18 The Indian Constitution not only prohibits discrimination based on religion, but also guarantees the right to freely profess and practise religion.19\n[42] The Appellants argue that harassment and violence against religious minorities are increasing across India and religious freedom in India has become limited. I acknowledge that a rise in Hindu nationalism has coincided with increased violence and discrimination against religious minorities.20 I also acknowledge that Sikhs face localized discrimination, and many have been accused of being separatists, but the evidence before me indicates that when Sikhs do face localized discrimination, such issues can be adequately addressed by the local courts or police.21\n[43] I do not believe any discrimination they may face based on their Sikh identity will make New Delhi or Kolkata untenable for them. I also find the Appellants will be able to practise their religion in New Delhi and Kolkata.\nThe detention of the associate Appellant\n[44] The associate Appellant testified that as the subject of a police detention, she has suffered a loss of honour in India. I acknowledge that to be a serious concern for her. However uncomfortable it might be for her to return to India, I find returning with her husband and sons will ameliorate some of that discomfort and such discomfort does not rise to the threshold of jeopardizing her life or safety. Further, it is unlikely that people in her new IFA communities will ever learn of her previous encounter with the police.\n[45] In conclusion, I find any hardship faced by the Appellants in New Delhi or Kolkata will not jeopardize their lives or safety and, thus, it would be reasonable for them to relocate there.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJennifer A.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a citizen of Mexico. His romantic relationship with the girlfriend of a high-ranking member of a criminal group provoked the member's anger. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, he was assaulted and threatened while at his female friend's house. The next day, the agent of harm called him and repeated his threats. That evening, the appellant filed a police report and received protective measures against his agent of harm. The agent of harm failed to show up following multiple summonses before various proceedings. When the appellant followed up with the authorities, the danger he faced was confirmed to him. His agent of harm called to tell him that it was careless for him to go to the authorities, and he continued to utter threats. The appellant became suspicious after seeing several vehicles with tinted windows pass by his home, which led him to leave the state of Chiapas for the state of Veracruz on XXXX XXXX, 2017. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, his agent of harm called and threatened him again, saying that he knew he had left Chiapas. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, he returned to his city to prepare for his departure and took steps to obtain his passport. He returned to Veracruz and stayed there until XXXX XXXX, before leaving Mexico for Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXThe Refugee Protection Division (RPD) determined that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection given that he has an internal flight alternative (IFA) in La Paz, Baja California.\n[2] The appellant's memorandum argues that the RPD erred in its decision in that:\n- the agent of harm's gang has ties with another group present in the IFA;\n- the gang has the means to find him; and\n- the IFA is unsafe.\n[3] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is the IFA.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in determining that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[5] The appellant submitted the following new evidence:\n- New evidence 1: excerpt from the Mexican government's website on the Unique Population Registry Code (CURP)\n- New evidence 2: excerpt from the Mexican government's website on birth certificates\n- New evidence 3: excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council website dated July 12, 2021\n- New evidence 4: excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council website dated July 4, 2022\n- New evidence 5: excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council website dated August 15, 2022\n- New evidence 6: article from the Naci\u00f3n 321 newspaper dated August 9, 2017, titled, \"Who is Raul Florez, the drug trafficker linked to Rafael Marquez and Julion Alvarez?\"\n- New evidence 7: article from the Univision newspaper dated August 14, 2022, titled, \"These three Mexican cartels are reportedly responsible for the travel alert in California\"\n- New evidence 8: article from the Univision newspaper dated August 13, 2022, titled, \"Jalisco cartel threatening violence in northern Baja California: US citizens urged to take refuge\"\n- New evidence 9: undated statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nThe appellant's evidence is admitted in part\n[6] Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA), I can only allow evidence:\ni) that arose after the RPD rendered its decision;\nii) that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii) that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented to the RPD before the decision was rendered.\niv) If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before admitting it.2\nNew evidence 1: excerpt from the Mexican government's website on the Unique Population Registry Code (CURP)\n[7] The excerpt from the Mexican government's website on the Unique Population Registry Code existed before the RPD rendered its decision. As it was available on the website, it does not constitute new evidence; the national package also refers to it. This new evidence is rejected.\nNew evidence 2: excerpt from the Mexican government's website on birth certificates\n[8] The excerpt from the Mexican government's website on birth certificates existed before the RPD rendered its decision. As it was available on the website, it does not constitute new evidence; the national package also refers to it. This new evidence is rejected.\nNew evidence 3: excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council website dated July 12, 2021\n[9] The excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council existed before the RPD rendered its decision. The appellant could have presented it after the hearing and before the decision was rendered. This new evidence is rejected.\nNew evidence 4: excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council website dated July 4, 2022\n[10] The excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council existed before the RPD rendered its decision. The appellant could have presented it after the hearing and before the decision was rendered. This new evidence is rejected.\nNew evidence 5: excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council website dated August 15, 2022\n[11] The excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council did not exist until after the RPD rendered its decision. As a result, the appellant could not have presented it before the decision was rendered. It is new evidence. The Overseas Security Advisory Council is a credible source, and the evidence is relevant as it relates to security in Baja California, the identified IFA. This new evidence is admitted and numbered A-1.\nNew evidence 6: article from the Naci\u00f2n 321 newspaper dated August 9, 2017, titled, \"Who is Raul Florez, the drug trafficker linked to Rafael Marquez and Julion Alvarez?\"\n[12] The article existed before the RPD rendered its decision. The appellant could have presented it before the decision was rendered. This new evidence is rejected.\nNew evidence 7: article from the Univision newspaper dated August 14, 2022, titled, \"These three Mexican cartels are reportedly responsible for the travel alert in California\"\n[13] The article appeared after the RPD rendered its decision. As a result, the appellant could not have presented it beforehand. This is new evidence from a credible source, and it is relevant as it pertains to the issue of safety in the identified designated IFA. This new evidence is admitted and numbered A-2.\nNew evidence 8: article from the Univision newspaper dated August 13, 2022, titled, \"Jalisco cartel threatening violence in northern Baja California: US citizens urged to take refuge\"\n[14] The article appeared after the RPD rendered its decision. As a result, the appellant could not have presented it beforehand. This is new evidence from a credible source, and it is relevant as it pertains to the issue of safety in the identified IFA. This new evidence is admitted and numbered A-3.\nNew evidence 9: undated statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[15] The statement is undated. However, it pertains to events that took place between 2017 and 2021, before the decision was rendered. The appellant provided other statements and could have presented this one. There is no explanation in the memorandum as to why it could not have been presented earlier. It is rejected.\nANALYSIS\n[16] My role is to review all the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.3 The appellant's problems with his agent of harm, who is an influential member of a criminal gang, stem from a romantic relationship with the member's girlfriend. When the relationship was discovered, the appellant was assaulted and threatened, and although the appellant filed a report and requested police protection, the threats did not subside. Although the appellant tried to go into hiding in another city, his agent of harm continued to contact him and told him that he was watching out for him.\nThe agent of harm's gang has ties with another group present in the IFA and therefore has the means to locate the appellant\n[17] According to the appellant's memorandum, the RPD erred in identifying an IFA in La Paz, Baja California. The RPD justified this choice by the considerable distance between the IFA and the source of the problems. It also noted that the agent of harm lacked the ability to locate the appellant that far away. In addition, it considered that there was insufficient evidence to establish that his agent of harm has the motivation to carry out his threats against him.\n[18] First, the appellant argues that the agent of harm belongs to a criminal organization linked to others nationwide. This would allow for a strategic alliance. The RPD considered the evidence of this affiliation to be rather speculative. Moreover, the fact that the agent of harm is a member of a criminal gang was itself considered speculative in that the appellant allegedly found out about it through his girlfriend, and was not implicitly or explicitly informed of this by the main person concerned. Second, the RPD also noted that aside from the initial altercation and the three telephone threats, the agent of harm's behaviour does not support the conclusion, on a balance of probabilities, that he took action personally or through others to find the appellant or to carry out his threats.\n[19] At first glance, the appellant's credibility is not an issue. As a result, certain facts can be extrapolated from his testimony and his written account. His girlfriend told him about the dangerous nature of the agent of harm and his probable ties with a notorious group. At the same time, the agent of harm threatened to kill, kidnap and dismember him. He told him that he had already done it to others, and there is evidence of similar acts in the area. This is in fact the modus operandi of criminal groups. Moreover, when the appellant turned to the authorities for help, he was told by the very people who should have protected him that he was in a precarious situation, that his agent of harm was furious, and that there was no real protection from such individuals. In addition, the agent of harm disregarded the summonses he received and boasted about them to the appellant, suggesting that he did not fear repercussions for these breaches. This adds to the argument that the agent of harm is somewhat important and enjoys a degree of protection from the authorities, as a police officer told the appellant. On a balance of probabilities, the agent of harm is fairly heavily involved with a criminal organization which, on a balance of probabilities, is as his girlfriend told him.\n[20] Ties with other criminal groups have not been established. However, the documentary evidence reports that cooperation exists among various organizations. A major criminal operation such as the one the agent of harm reportedly belongs to involves a certain association with other larger organizations. As a result, I consider that, on a balance of probabilities, the agent of harm has access to other resources and is therefore able to track down the appellant in the IFA.4\nMotivation to find him\n[21] The RPD concluded that the agent of harm does not have the motivation to locate the appellant, noting that:\n- there were only three threatening telephone calls between discovering the affair and the appellant's departure for Canada;\n- there was no escalation or other direct or indirect threats, even though the agent of harm was in a position to locate him or carry out the threats; and\n- the lack of communication combined with the passage of time shows a lack of interest in the appellant.\n[22] The memorandum does not contain any arguments against this conclusion regarding the agent of harm's motivation, which I consider to be correct.\nThe internal flight alternative is considered unsafe\n[23] The appellant's memorandum argues that the IFA identified by the RPD is unsafe, citing as new evidence an excerpt from the Overseas Security Advisory Council website dated August 15, 2022. This excerpt, titled \"Security Alert: Baja California Norte (Mexico), Shelter in Place Lifted\" mentions existing conditions and suggests that US citizens reconsider all travel due to crime and kidnapping in the region.\n[24] The RPD noted that the identified IFA is relatively populated and located XXXX XXXX XXXX km from the appellant's home, and that violence in the region generally affects individuals involved in the drug trade, a risk that does not pertain to the appellant.\n[25] The identified IFA is not without risk of violence. According to the Mexico Peace Index,5 Baja California Sur ranks 19th out of Mexico's 32 states in terms of peacefulness. However, it recorded a 75 percent improvement in both firearms crimes and homicides with a firearm. It should also be noted that Baja California Sur is among the states with the highest levels of positive peace, which is a measure of the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies.6 As for violence, it is generally drug-related and affects those involved in the drug trade.7 However, groups can rely on resources to track people of interest in order to seek revenge. Personal vengeance is one of the motivating factors that can lead a gang to look for someone outside their region and justifies using corrupt law enforcement officers to obtain information about the person.\n[26] The IFA is relatively safe. In this case, the agent of harm did not demonstrate any motivation to find the appellant. Considering the personal nature of his affront to the agent of harm, the lack of action or escalation suggests that, on a balance of probabilities, the appellant will not be subjected to a risk to his life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture in the IFA.\n[27] The appellant's memorandum does not raise any arguments against the RPD's conclusions regarding the second prong of the IFA. The appellant has a XXXX XXXX in XXXX with significant work experience in a variety of fields, with no cultural, religious, language or socio-economic barriers. The conclusion that these factors make his relocation to the IFA objectively reasonable is correct. Lastly, the psychological factor raised in connection with relocating to the IFA was duly analyzed by the RPD, and its conclusion in this respect is also correct.\n[28] Accordingly, while the agent of harm may be a member of an organization with ties to others that would enable him to locate the appellant in the IFA, the lack of motivation with regard to a personal situation leads to the correct conclusion that the appellant will not be subjected to a risk to his life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture in the IFA. Given the appellant's personal experience and circumstances, his relocation would be objectively reasonable.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD's determination that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nRichard Sheitoyan\nRichard Sheitoyan\nJanuary 10, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Subs. 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n2 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They claim to fear their former husband\/father and members of the Dharma Gurus because of erroneously imputed religious faith. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the Appellants not to be credible, and rejected their claims in a decision dated August 18, 2022.\n[2] The Appellants appeal the RPD's decision to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).1The Appellants ask that the RAD set aside the decision of the RPD, and substitute its own determination that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. In the alternative, the Appellants request that the matter be referred to a different panel of the RPD for redetermination.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The principal Appellant is a 50-year-old Hindu woman from Gujarat. The associate Appellant is her daughter, aged 13.\n[5] The principal Appellant was married to XXXX XXXX XXXX (VAP) and they are the parents of the associate Appellant.\n[6] It is alleged that VAP started an extramarital affair in XXXX or XXXX 2019, and concurrently became abusive to the principal Appellant. In XXXX 2019, the Appellants moved to the home of the principal Appellant's parents where they stay until XXXX 2019.\n[7] The Appellants alleged that VAP wants to kill the principal Appellant because she has allegedly disgraced the family's honour and reputation. It is further alleged that VAP is wealthy and his wealth has allowed him to foster close ties to politicians, police, and influential religious leaders.\n[8] In XXXX 2019, three unidentified men attended at the home of the principal Appellant's parents looking for the principal Appellant and threatening to kill her. They were scared off by her father. When her father attempted to file a police report, the police told him that there was a complaint filed against his daughter on the grounds she had converted to Islam, and was spreading negative messages about Hinduism. They further advised that the only reason she was not arrested was because the police were friendly with VAP. Around that time, the principal Appellant learned that VAP was involved with another woman, and he was the person responsible for spreading rumours about her religious conversion.\n[9] In XXXX 2019, the Appellants' home was raided again by three unidentified men. This time the men claimed that the principal Appellant had dishonoured their god. The principal Appellant's father was able to scare the men away by shooting at them. After this incident, the Appellants fled to Canada on a temporary resident visa (TRV) previously applied for in XXXX 2019.\n[10] The Appellants made a claim for protection shortly after arriving in Canada. Their hearing before the RPD was held on August 8, 2022.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[11] The new evidence is not accepted. According to the law,2 the Appellants may only present evidence that arose after the rejection of their claims or that was not reasonably available, or they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejections. If the evidence meets one of these requirements, it must also be new, credible, and relevant to be admissible.3\n[12] It is for the Appellants to make a full and detailed submission in their memorandum about how any proposed new evidence meets the requirements of the law, and how that evidence relates to them.4\nThe new evidence shall not be admitted\n[13] The new evidence the Appellants seek to submit consists of:\na. Affidavit from the principal Appellant, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022.5\n[14] The affidavit contains explanations and justifications for the answers provided during the hearing. The affiant retracts her claim that the whispering heard during the hearing was from her daughter's iPad in another room and now claims it was her daughter and son speaking outside of her door.\n[15] Nothing in this affidavit postdates the rejection of the Appellants' claims or was not reasonably available to the Appellants at the time of the rejection. Further, it is expected that the Appellants provide fulsome, accurate and non-misleading answers at the hearing.\n[16] Accordingly, this affidavit may not be accepted as new evidence. I shall treat it as submissions.\nORAL HEARING\n[17] The Appellants have requested an oral hearing. They argue that since credibility is at the core of the RPD decision, the RAD should convene an oral hearing to properly assess the Appellants' credibility. The legislative criteria for an oral hearing before the RAD have not been met. Oral hearings can only be convened by the RAD when new evidence which is admissible on appeal raises a serious issue with respect to the Appellants' credibility that is central to the decision, and if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.6\n[18] No new evidence has been admitted and, therefore, an oral hearing cannot be held.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[19] The standard of correctness applies to this appeal as set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica.7 This requires an independent assessment of the refugee claim to determine whether the RPD was correct in its findings and determinations.8 While deference can be afforded to the RPD on specific issues when it enjoys a meaningful advantage over the RAD in making findings of fact or mixed fact and law, such an advantage does not arise in the present case. Upon my review of the transcript, I find the RPD decision is based primarily on evidence found in the record. The RPD referred to physical actions taken by the principal Appellant, such as muting her microphone, during the hearing. These actions are not disputed by the Appellants and, therefore, I accept certain actions did occur.\nANALYSIS\n[20] Following my independent assessment of the record, including reading the transcript of the RPD proceeding and listening to the recording of the hearing, I agree with the RPD and find the Appellants not to be a Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The RPD correctly found the Appellants failed to establish that they face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[21] In making my decision, I have considered the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board (Gender Guidelines)9 and the Chairperson's Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues (Child Guidelines).10\nCredibility\n[22] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.11 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.12 The existence of contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence can be a valid basis for a finding of lack of credibility.13 I may also consider the vagueness of a claimant's evidence based on common sense and rationality in regard to the surrounding circumstances.14 For reasons given below, including inconsistencies in the evidence about the principal Appellant's marital status, and whether she sought a divorce, and evidence that the principal Appellant was coached during the hearing rebut the presumption of truthfulness.\nThe principal Appellant was coached during the hearing\n[23] The RPD correctly drew a negative credibility inference from evidence that the principal Appellant received coaching during the hearing. When asked how she obtained a custody letter signed by her former husband, the principal Appellant gave inconsistent and evolving answers. At this point she muted her microphone and, when asked to unmute herself, she immediately asked to take a break. When she returned from the break, she was asked a follow-up question. She paused after the question was interpreted and during that pause whispering could be heard. When asked to explain the whispering, the principal Appellant said it had come from her daughter's iPad in another room. The RPD did not accept this answer and found that she was coached. The Appellants argue that she was not coached, and that the whispering was done by her son and daughter who were just outside her door.\n[24] I have listened to the recording of the hearing, and I can hear the whispering clearly. Although, I cannot discern what was whispered, from the volume of the whisper, I can discern that the whisperer was in very close proximity to the microphone used by the principal Appellant. The RPD asked a question, the question was interpreted, whispering could be heard, and then the principal Appellant answered. Based on the timing of the question, the intervening whisper, and the principal Appellant's eventual response, I find on a balance of probabilities that she was coached.\n[25] In trying to determine whose voice was heard, the RPD asked the principal Appellant who was currently in her home to which she responded it was only herself and her daughter. The RPD then said it sounded like a man's voice and the principal Appellant confirmed no men were present in her home. In their memorandum, the Appellants concede that the adult son\/brother was also present. The principal Appellant was directly asked who was present and, by her own admission, she chose to mislead the RPD. I do not accept a state of nervousness is a reasonable explanation for deliberately misleading the RPD. I find this deception undermines the principal Appellant's credibility.\n[26] The Appellants argue that there was whispering in the background for less than 10 seconds, and that is an insufficient basis from which to find the principal Appellant was coached. I do not agree with this assertion. The recording establishes, on a balance of probabilities that she did receive coaching on at least one occasion. Further, the record establishes that shortly before the whispering episode, the principal Appellant appeared confused, was unable to answer a question, asked for some time and then muted her microphone. The moment she was asked to unmute her microphone, she asked for a break. Given that I have found evidence on the record that she was coached, I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that she was coached while she muted her microphone. The Appellant argues the evidence establishes that, at most, she was coached for less than 10 seconds, however, I find that the record establishes that she was coached twice.\n[27] The RPD reviewed the recent case law on misconduct during virtual hearings. It has been determined that interference in the fact-finding process by abusing or taking advantage of a virtual examination strikes at the integrity of fact-finding and may not be tolerated.15 In another case, the Federal Court16 upheld a negative credibility finding made by the RPD in an instance where one applicant whispered answers to another applicant. The Appellants argue that these cases can be distinguished from the case at hand as in those cases the coaching was more clearly captured, and went on for a longer duration.\n[28] I find that any coaching undermines the integrity of these proceedings and cannot be tolerated. Furthermore, the principal Appellant has provided two separate explanations for the whispering which I find to be untrue. The first explanation was the noise came from her daughter's iPad in another room, while the second explanation was that the noise came from her son and daughter speaking in another room. I find neither of these explanations to be true because the source of the sound was immediately adjacent to the principal Appellant's microphone. Accordingly, I find the coaching, which was clearly heard, undermines her credibility and her explanations, which I find to be unreasonable, further undermine her credibility.\nThe status of the principal Appellant's marriage\n[29] The RPD correctly drew a negative credibility inference from the inconsistencies in the Appellants' evidence about the principal Appellant's marital status, and her efforts made since 2019 to obtain a divorce. The principal Appellant provided inconsistent evidence with respect to her marital status and inconsistent and evolving evidence about steps taken to obtain a divorce. When asked why she claimed to be married in her immigration forms, the principal Appellant claimed she needed to do so because she was not yet divorced. The RPD did not find this explanation to be reasonable as the principal Appellant had referred to herself as separated in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form which was completed around the same time. The principal Appellant was asked several times whether she sought a divorce, and each time the answer was slightly different. The RPD found the evidence about whether the principal Appellant ever sought a divorce to evolve.\n[30] I cannot uphold the RPD's finding that the inconsistency in the principal Appellant's evidence about her marital status undermines her credibility. In her BOC and in her testimony, she consistently claimed that she and her husband separated in XXXX 2019. In the Generic Applicantion, she stated she was married to VAP. This was technically true and remains technically true. The RPD seems to indicate that she was asked to choose from married, single, separated, divorced, and widow options but I cannot find that reference myself. The principal Appellant was legally married at the time she filled out her Generic Application, and therefore her claim to be married does not undermine her credibility.\n[31] However, I do find the principal Appellant's testimony about the steps taken to obtain a divorce to be inconsistent, vague, and evolving. I find these inconsistencies undermine her credibility. The principal Appelant claimed to be at risk because VAP wanted to end her life in order to marry his new girlfriend. When asked if she considered divorcing her husband to allow him to marry his girlfriend, the principal Appellant said she did not have time to think about divorce because her life was in danger prior to leaving India. When asked if she considered getting a divorce in Canada, she said since they were living separately she had not considered it. She went on to say that if VAP had requested a divorce she would have accepted it. When asked why she had not considered getting a divorce during her three years in Canada, she claimed that she had tried to get a divorce in India but her husband would not give her one because of his reputation. The RPD then asked the principal Appellant to confirm that she had attempted to get a divorce and she confirmed the same. When asked when she had attempted to get a divorce, the principal Appellant started to recite events from her narrative including when three masked men came to her father's house and her father's response. The RPD repeated the question and pointed out that earlier she testified to have never considered a divorce while in India. She then said her father had approached VAP who allegedly said he would never agree to a divorce because of his reputation. She then immediately went on to refer to the police and religious gurus. For a third time, the RPD asked her to describe what steps she took to obtain a divorce in India, to which she said her father discussed the topic with VAP but VAP refused.\n[32] The principal Appellant testified that she never considered getting a divorce in India because she was trying to save her life. She also testified that she made attempts to get a divorce while in India. Despite making several efforts, the RPD was unable to get the principal Appellant to explain this discrepancy. These two statements cannot be reconciled.\n[33] The principal Appellant's marriage to VAP is foundational to her claim. She should be able to clearly and consistently answer questions about whether she considered divorcing VAP and, if so, what steps she took. I also find that her need to preface her answers by going back to unrelated facts in her narrative makes it sound like she memorized her narrative as opposed to spontaneously recounting her lived life, and that undermines her credibility. In addition, I find the discrepancy in the evidence about whether the principal Appellant attempted to get a divorce in India which was not reasonably explained undermines her credibility in general.\n[34] The RPD made other negative credibility findings about how the Appellants obtained certain documentary evidence. I do not need to address those findings as I find the credibility findings made above to be determinative.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJennifer A.

He is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated August 31, 2022, dismissing his claim for protection. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in assessing his claim, and he asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow his appeal and determine that he is a Convention1 refugee or a person in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,2 or to send the matter back to the RPD for redetermination.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Appellant was falsely accused by police of association with terrorists because his son's friend, XXXX XXXX (G.S.), was under suspicion of involvement with militants. When the Appellant was in Saudi Arabia, police arrested XXXX XXXX (H.S.) and G.S in XXXX 2019, causing the Appellant to return to facilitate his son's release. The police continued to harass and question the Appellant and his family about his son. The police made accusations that he is collecting funds in Saudi Arabia and Canada to support militants. The Appellant's house was raided in XXXX 2019 and he was arrested, and when released with a bribe, he was told to report monthly and to bring his son. The Appellant tried to obtain help from the district commissioner. The police went to his house again, however, the Appellant was not at home. The Appellant then decided to travel to Canada in XXXX 2019. The Appellant states that since he fled India, the police continue to visit his wife in search of him two or three times per year.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee, and he is not a person in need of protection, in that his removal to India would not subject him personally to a risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\nTHE ROLE OF THE RAD\n[4] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.3 In doing so, I have carried out my own independent analysis of the RPD Record, including the RPD's reasons and decision and the transcript of the RPD hearing, to determine whether the RPD erred.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[5] The Appellant does not request new evidence be admitted in this appeal. Owing to the fact that no new evidence has been admitted, I have no authority to hold a hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The RPD found that the determinative issue was the availability of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Mumbai or Bengaluru.\n[7] The Appellant states that the RPD erred in its IFA analysis.\nWhether the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Mumbai or Bengaluru\n[8] Under the test, both prongs must be met once an IFA has been identified. The burden of proof is on the Appellant to establish that there is no IFA. In assessing an IFA, the Appellant's circumstances and profile must be taken into consideration. For the second prong, the Appellant must overcome a very high threshold to demonstrate that the IFA location is unreasonable by providing evidence that the Appellant's life and safety would be jeopardized by relocating to the proposed location.4 The Federal Court of Appeal has stated:\nWe read the decision of Linden J.A. for this Court as setting up a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.5\nWhether the RPD erred in finding that there was No Serious Risk of Harm under the First Prong of the Test\n[9] The first prong of the IFA test states that there must be a finding that there is no serious possibility that the Appellant will be persecuted in the proposed IFA or that the Appellant will not be personally subject to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, believed on substantial grounds to exist, in the IFA.\nRPD's findings\n[10] The RPD found as credible that the Punjab police were looking for the Appellant's son, that the Appellant was selected when his son could not be found, he was accused of collaborating with militants, that he left his village, and that the police continued to look for him even though he had left for New Delhi, and that the police continue to look for him two or three times per year.\n[11] The RPD also found that there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of an affidavit from the village sarpanch and a letter from a medical clinic.\n[12] The RPD found that the Appellant does not have a profile that indicates he is a person of interest to the Punjab state police such that they would pursue him in the IFA locations. The RPD found that the evidence is not sufficient to establish that the Punjab police are motivated to pursue the Appellant in the proposed IFA locations noting that he has been away for three years. The RPD found that the police are not sufficiently motivated to pursue him outside their local area to the IFA locations thousands of kilometres away from his village after he left. It found that that he has not established that his name appears on any police database nor that he has a profile of high interest to the police, and that he had no issues leaving the country.\n[13] The RPD found that, although the police make inquires about him two or three time a year since 2019, it found that the frequency of visits over a three-year period indicates that the police do not have sufficient motivation to find the Appellant throughout India.\n[14] Owing to the fact that it found that the Punjab police are not motivated to pursue the Appellant to the IFA locations, the RPD found that it is not necessary to assess whether the police have the means to locate the Appellant in those locations.\nAppellant's submissions\n[15] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in finding that the agents of persecution do not have the motivation to pursue him.\n[16] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred because he has been accused of militancy or \"terrorism\" which is classified as a \"major crime\" that warrants interstate police communication. The Appellant states that the RPD erred in finding that he has not been accused of a major crime as per the objective evidence6 since he has been \"accused, arrested, persecuted and harassed on allegation of militancy\/terrorism,\" that would incite the mobilization of interstate police resources.7 The Appellant submits that other RAD decisions have confirmed this finding.\n[17] The Appellant submits that the continuing motivation of the police confirms that the police are sufficiently motivated to continue visiting and harassing the Appellant's family members as recent as XXXX of 2022. The Appellant submits that the objective evidence8 confirms that even without a formal charge of a First Information Report (FIR), pro-Khalistan supporters are perceived as advocating for terrorism and are closely monitored by authorities.9\n[18] The Appellant submits that the caselaw states that where the agent of persecution is the police, there is no viable IFA. As such, the Appellant submits that because the police have accused him of militancy and supporting terrorism, he faces persecution by government authorities and as such does not have viable IFA. Therefore, the Appellant submits that the agents of persecution have the means to locate him in the proposed IFA and the RPD's finding that there is no motivation is incorrect.\n[19] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred by determining the viability of the proposed IFAs despite confirming the credibility of his allegations. The Appellant submits that the RPD's finding is in contravention of the principles in the Ali case10 where the Court said that it would not be reasonable to expect family to place their own lives in danger by either denying knowledge of the Appellant's whereabouts or misleading the persecutors. The Appellant submits that his family cannot be expected to continue to put their own lives at risk which would force him to hide in his new location from his family.\nFindings on Prong One of the IFA Test\n[20] In my independent assessment of the evidence, I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant has not established that the agents of persecution neither have the motivation nor the means to pursue the Appellant in one of the proposed IFAs.\nThe Appellant has not established that the Punjab police have the motivation to pursue him in any of the proposed IFAs\n[21] I find that the RPD is correct in finding that the Appellant has not established that the Punjab police have the motivation to pursue the Appellant in Bengaluru or Mumbai. I find that the Appellant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that the Punjab police have any continuing interest in him.\n[22] As I understand that the Appellant's submissions, the Punjab police remain motivated to pursue him throughout India because he has been accused of associating with militants and gangsters, and because militancy and terrorism is classified as a major crime, the Punjab police will invoke the necessary resources for inter-state communication. I do not agree with this submission.\n[23] First, the Appellant facilitated the release of his son with a bribe because he was detained in XXXX of that year on the allegation that his friend, G.S., was working for militants. The Appellant was then detained in XXXX 2019 because the police were looking for his son. The Appellant was released after his detention again with the facilitated through a bribe.11 In April of that year, the police went to the Appellant's house though he was not at home, and that he had subsequently fled to New Delhi, and eventually to Canada. Although being detained, the Appellant testified that he has never been charged with a crime and has no criminal record.12 In my review of the RPD Record, there is no evidence that the Appellant was formally arrested, charged or that a FIR was issued against him. There is no evidence that the Appellant is a person of interest to the Punjab police, except that the police made some accusations against him in 2019.\n[24] Second, the Appellant was detained once, but released with a bribe, and was told by the police to periodically report back them. It is not reasonable that, if the Punjab police really were concerned that the Appellant was associating with terrorist and militants, he would be released with a bribe. From the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC), the last visit from the police that caused the Appellant to flee to New Delhi was because he complained about the police to the district commissioner, as opposed to being connected to any militant group.13 Further, the Appellant testified he was able to leave India without incident with the help of an agent.14\n[25] Third, the Appellant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence pertaining to the specific nature of the allegations made against him by the police. In my review of the RPD Record, I find that the accusations made by the police and the Appellant's understanding of those accusations, to be vague and generic in nature. In the Appellant's BOC, he mentions that the police accuse him of \"associating with militants\"15 and the affidavit from the village sarpanch16 does not provide any more specific information other than stating that the Appellant was accused of associating with militants and gangsters. Moreover, the RPD asked a number of questions to clarify the nature and content of the accusations. The Appellant replied as follows:\nMEMBER: Okay and what does that mean, what does being a terrorist mean?\nCLAIMANT: It just means that you spoil the atmosphere of the area where you are living.\nMEMBER: But who are these terrorists in your hometown, by that I mean, what is a terrorist there, put it in context?\nCLAIMANT: They were there you know before many years before in our village they were there.\nMEMBER: What kind of terrorists are they? What do they want?\nCLAIMANT: Yes, well some of them are like - they push drugs, et cetera.\nMEMBER: Okay, so if the police accused you of being a terrorist. What did you understand that to mean even at the time?\nCLAIMANT: Police was just saying that you've got relations or connections, with the terrorists.\nMEMBER: Does that mean with drug dealers or what are terrorists there?\nCLAIMANT: Well, people that you know roam around with weapons freely or they push drugs or they sort of loot other people or steal from them.17\n[26] I find that the Appellant's testimony is vague and does not disclose that he is being directly accused of any specific terrorist or militancy act, such as working for a pro-Khalistan group. Contrary to the Appellant's submissions, I therefore find that the Appellant has not established that the police considers that he committed a \"major crime\" so as to invoke the need for inter-state resources. Instead, the police made general accusations and then released upon the payment of a bribe. The Appellant cites the objective evidence that the Punjab police remains interested in pro-Khalistan supporters, even if no FIR is filed. However, the Appellant has not provided any specific evidence, whether in his testimony or documentary evidence, that he was accused of being a pro-Khalistan militant. Moreover, the vagueness of the accusations he describes makes it unclear if the accusations are related to militants or drug dealers or both.\n[27] The Appellant states that the \"RAD decisions have confirmed this finding\" although it is unclear what finding he is referring to and the RAD decisions are not referenced.\n[28] The Appellant quotes extensively from the objective evidence to establish that those persons who are accused of supporting a separate Khalistan are monitored. However, I find that the Appellant does not fall within the category of persons contemplated in the objective evidence. The objective evidence states that those accused of supporting Khalistan are under scrutiny and often charged in terrorism related offences.18\n[29] The Appellant further quotes the objective evidence stating that those pro-Khalistan supporters will be tracked when moving to another state. However, I find that the Appellant's references must be taken into context. The document states:\nAccording to sources, the police \"keep track of\" (Emeritus Professor 29 Apr. 2022) or \"monitor\" Khalistan supporters (Associate Professor 4 May 2022; Representative 12 May 2022). According to the Associate Professor, security services are more likely to focus on Sikh separatists because they represent \"a perceived political threat to the unity of India\" (Associate Professor 4 May 2022). According to the Emeritus Professor, individuals who attend SAD(A) speeches will be tracked by the police and Khalistan activists who participate in activities such as demonstrations, meetings or posting on social media will be monitored (Emeritus Professor 29 Apr. 2022). The same source further stated that individuals who move to another city will continue to be tracked since that information will be shared (Emeritus Professor 29 Apr. 2022).19\n[30] In my review of the objective evidence, the sources are directed to political activists or those that participated in pro-Khalistan activities, while in the present appeal, there is no evidence that the Appellant had any involvement in such activities and there is no evidence that the Punjab police even accused the Appellant of being \"pro-Khalistan.\" The Appellant testified that he has not been involved in any political activities while in India.20 In his testimony, the Appellant did not indicate that he would be tracked owing to the police accusations, as the RPD asked him if he considered going to another part of India, and \"Because I've already made a trip to Canada. I kind of looked around Canada when I had come in 2018.\" 21 Hence, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant would not be tracked considering there were only vague accusations against him, and that in fact, he had never participated in any political activities while in India. I note that there is no reference in the Appellant's narrative, testimony or documentary evidence that suggests he was involved in \"pro-Khalistan\" activities.\nThe Appellant will not have to be in hiding in the proposed IFAs\n[31] The Appellant cites jurisprudence where it found that it would not be reasonable to expect family members to place their own lives in danger by denying knowledge of the claimant's whereabouts.22 I find that the circumstances of the present appeal are different than the caselaw cited by the Appellant. In the Ali case, the agents of harm were members of a terrorist group who threatened violence and death against the claimants and their families. As in this appeal, the Courts have held that claimants are not in hiding where they have not provided any evidence to suggest that their family would undermine their safety in the IFAs as it is their onus to establish that there is a likelihood of their whereabouts being disclosed to the agents of harm.23 In the present case, there is no evidence that the Appellant's family is required to hide the Appellant's whereabouts to keep them safe as the Appellant did not testify that there were threats of violence or actual violence against the Appellant's wife by the Punjab police since he left India. Although the police occasionally seek information from the Appellant's wife, there is no evidence that she is in danger of withholding information. I recognize that the Appellant's narrative states that his wife was assaulted in 2019, the Appellant testified that the police visited her, and that \"of course she felt threatened.\"24 I note that the Appellant's wife did not provide any evidence by way of a letter or affidavit and hence, there is little detailed information concerning more specifically what the police are asking and the context of their visits. However, the Appellant did testify that the police do not know that he is in Canada,25 and hence, his location has not been disclosed for over three and one-half years.\nThe proposed IFAs are viable even though the police are the agents of persecution\n[32] The Appellants put forth the submission, based on the Li26 case, that no IFA is available where the agent of persecution is the police, and having been accused of having links to militants, he is not safe anywhere in the country. In my review of the caselaw, however, I do not agree that police involvement in and of itself negates the need to undertake an IFA analysis.\n[33] Even if the police are the agents of persecution, the onus remains on the Appellant to provide sufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm, such as whether the police have a continue interest to pursue them.27 An IFA analysis must be based on the facts and circumstances of the matter such as the national reach and structure of the police authorities, the level of interest by the police and other relevant considerations. In this case, the police have demonstrated an interest to make occasional inquiries within his village, there is no evidence that the Punjab police have an interest in pursuing him in any other state and employ inter-state mechanisms to locate the Appellant.\n[34] The Courts have held that while a person has a well-founded fear of persecution by government authorities in one part of the country, does not necessarily mean there is a well-founded fear of persecution by the same agents in another part of the country. In He,28 the Court stated:\nIf an internal flight alternative can exist where the alleged persecutor is a state agent (see Saini v Canada (MCI), [1993] FCJ No 280, 151 NR 239 (FCA)), it is not unreasonable to consider that the Applicant would be safe from state persecution in a particular region of China, despite abuses that may occur elsewhere in the country.29\n[35] Hence, it is necessary to review the viability of relocating a claimant to another part of the country based on whether the person would face a serious risk of persecution or harm in that location. As I have found, the Appellant's profile and the level of interest by the Punjab police is such that the police would not engage in resources to search for the Appellant in another state. I also note that the objective evidence indicates that, in general, a person fearing state and non-state actors, including rogue state actors, is likely to be able to internally relocate to another area of India.30\nThe Punjab police do not have the means to track the Appellant in the circumstances of this appeal\n[36] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred as it did not make findings on whether the Punjab police have the means to locate him in one of the proposed IFAs. I find that the RPD did not err in this regard because if the police do not have the motivation to pursue the Appellant, a RPD finding that I have found to be correct, the issue of whether they have the means to do so is not germane. Nevertheless, I will undertake a brief analysis of whether the Punjab police have the means to locate the Appellant.\n[37] In my review of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India pertaining to the ability of the police to locate someone in another state, I find that the objective evidence is mixed, and it is necessary to review the particular circumstance of each case.\n[38] According to a recent document in the NDP, there is little inter-state police communication except for major crimes such as terrorism and organised crime.31 The same document states that police systems between districts and states are not integrated, creating \"[i]slands of technology\" which can only communicate within a state or district and this is makes tracking of persons difficult and the record of success by the police is mixed.32 The document indicates that India does not have a centralized registration system in place to check the whereabouts of inhabitants within their own state or in other states, although there is a good degree of cooperation among the police services.33 I note that the police in India are under state, rather than federal, jurisdiction, and, hence, each state and union territory had responsibilities for their own separate police forces.\n[39] The objective evidence also indicates that the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) is being implemented over time. The document shows that 97 percent of the police stations have network connectivity, indicating that over 90 percent of the police stations are able to conduct searches in the national database and are able to register FIRs in the CCTNS.34 The implementation of the availability of the CCTNS is tempered by whether it is actually be used. A document in the NDP states the emphasis of publicly available data is on connectivity and compliance and not the use of the system noting that there is no available data indicating the frequency with which investigators access the CCTNS database or the utility of authorities' CCTNS access to their investigations in practice.35\n[40] As noted, I therefore find that the evidence as to whether the police have the capacity or means to track persons between states is mixed, and that the police authorities are able to track those that have committed serious crime such as rape, murder and armed robbery.36 I have already noted that the evidence in this appeal is that the Appellant testified that he was never charged with any offence and he does not have a criminal record. There is no evidence to indicate that any FIRs have been registered against the Appellant, including complaints or warrants. The objective evidence indicates that there is no official record of extra-judicial arrests in any official criminal databases, including the CCTNS.37 Not only were the Appellant's detention extra-judicial, but he was released with the payment of a bribe. As such, I find that there is no evidence that the Appellant's name or information is captured within any police database. In summary, I find that even if the police wanted to use the CCTNS to track the Appellant, the Appellant has not established that he would be in the database given he has not been charged with any offence and there is no evidence an FIR has been registered against him.\nAadhaar Card\n[41] I find that the Appellant cannot be located through the use of the Aadhaar Card. A Response to Information Request researched by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada found in the NDP indicates that, according to the governing legislation, there is no legal access to Aadhaar data in any police database, including the CCTNS.38 I find, based on the information in the NDP, that the Appellant has not established that he can be tracked by obtaining an Aadhaar number.\nTenant Registration\n[42] According to the objective evidence, the tenant registration system is intended to detect whether a person has any criminal record.39 The document indicates that the system is mandatory and the tenant verification programme exists in Mumbai and Bengaluru.40 However, according to the same source, the police force is ill-equipped and short-staffed to actually carry out verifications.41 One source noted that the one of the states uses of CCTNS is the verification of tenants, but that CCTNS used for this purpose varies widely between states and that the police do not make any effort to follow up with the concerned police station of states.42 I find that the agents of persecution would not be able to use the tenant registration system to track the Appellant.\n[43] In summary, I find that the Appellant has not demonstrated that the Punjab police have the capacity or the motivation to pursue the Appellant. I find that the Appellant has not established that he will face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, in the proposed IFAs.\nDid the RPD err in finding that it was not unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to one of the proposed IFAs under the Second Prong of the Test?\nRPD's findings\n[44] The RPD found that the Appellant has not established that he would face undue hardship in the proposed IFAs to render his relocation objectively unreasonable.\n[45] The RPD found that the Appellant is well placed to find work in Bengaluru or Mumbai given his employment history. The RPD found that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant, as a Sikh and who speaks Punjabi, to relocate to one of the proposed IFAs.\nAppellant's submissions\n[46] The Appellant did not provide specific submissions with respect to Prong Two of the IFA test.\nFindings on Prong Two of IFA test\n[47] Under the second prong, there is a very high threshold requiring actual and concrete evidence of conditions which would jeopardize the life or safety of the Appellant in temporarily relocating to either of the identified proposed IFAs.43 I find that the RPD did not err in finding that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to any of the proposed IFAs.\nFindings\n[48] I agree with the RPD's finding that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to one of the IFAs.\n[49] According to the objective evidence, there are over 20 million Sikhs among India's total population of 1.2 billion.44 Although there are examples of discrimination, documents in the NDP indicate Sikhs generally do not face systemic problems in India based on their identity.45\n[50] The Appellant testified that, other than language, there was no other reason why he could not locate to one of the proposed IFAs.46 However, the objective evidence indicates that although the majority of Sikhs reside in Punjab, there are populations of Sikhs in other states. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant's language abilities does not make it objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to one of the proposed IFAs.\n[51] The Appellant also testified that he has work experience in Saudi Arabia and in Canada47 and when asked if he could obtain employment in one of the IFAs, he responded that he did not know.48 I find that the Appellant has a reasonable opportunity to seek employment in one of the proposed IFAs.\n[52] I have also reviewed the evidentiary record to review the Appellant's personal circumstances and I found no mental health, medical or other circumstance that would make his relocation to India objectively unreasonable.\n[53] After an independent assessment of the evidence, I conclude that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Mumbai or Bengaluru. I find that he does not face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, or a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in one of the proposed IFAs. I find that it would not be objectively unreasonable in all of the circumstances for the Appellant to relocate to one of the proposed IFAs.\nCONCLUSION\n[54] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPaul Muldoon\nPaul Muldoon\nJanuary 18, 2023\nDate\n1 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97.\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The appellants fear harassment and threats from the appellant's ex-husband, who they allege ordered the appellant's gang rape in XXXX 2017. The associate appellant also alleges that his life is at risk because he was falsely arrested and detained in XXXX 2017 for drug and weapons possession.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellants' claim based on credibility concerns and because it concluded that the appellants had an internal flight alternative (IFA) in the cities of Chandigarh and Delhi.\n[3] The appellants are appealing the RPD's decision and argue that the RPD erred in finding that they were not credible and that they would not face a serious possibility of persecution if they relocated within India. They are asking the Refugee Appeal Division to allow the appeal and either refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination or substitute its own determination.\n[4] The determinative issues in this appeal are credibility and the existence of an IFA.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD's decision is correct. The appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\nDecision of the Refugee Protection Division\n[6] The RPD concluded that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the appellants would face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Delhi or Chandigarh.\n[7] The RPD noted that the appellant recited almost verbatim the content of the written account in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) and had difficulty testifying in detail about her situation in India. Despite the allegations that her ex-husband would still be motivated to harm her and her brother, she stated that they have not heard from him in four or five years, even though he is one of the associate appellant's in-laws. The RPD concluded that the ex-husband's threats against the appellants were speculative. In light of the appellant's vague and evasive testimony regarding the custody arrangements with respect to the minor appellant and the measures her ex-husband took to obtain custody of their son, the RPD was of the opinion that the ex-husband was neither interested in obtaining custody of the minor appellant, nor able to do so. It therefore concluded that the appellant and the minor appellant could relocate within India.\n[8] With respect to the associate appellant, the RPD also found his testimony evasive and concluded that he was unable to explain the connection between his sister's ex-husband and his arrest for drug and weapons trafficking. It found that there was insufficient reliable and credible evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the police had an interest in the adult appellants. It considered that the evidence instead showed that the police were interested only in extorting the family, in particular because the Indian police are underfunded.\n[9] With regard to the reasonableness of the IFA, the RPD concluded that, considering their specific circumstances, the appellants had not demonstrated any conditions that would jeopardize their lives or safety in either Delhi or Chandigarh.\nAppellants' arguments\n[10] Regarding the RPD's credibility findings, the appellants argue that their allegations are presumed to be true and that there was no reason in this case to doubt their truthfulness.1 They note that a tribunal should make implausibility findings only in the clearest of cases and that it must be careful in doing so, because of cultural differences.2 They argue that the RPD was overzealous in its analysis of their credibility and the IFA.\n[11] The appellants submit that the conclusions regarding the motivation of their agents of harm are speculative. According to them, the ex-husband's timing and lack of legal action provide no basis to conclude that he is not interested in finding the appellant elsewhere in India. They argue that the RPD had to consider his past actions, the fact that the police are still inquiring about their whereabouts and the blood relationship between the minor appellant and his father.\n[12] The appellants allege that the agents of harm are sufficiently motivated to find them. They also submit that the RPD had no concrete evidence to conclude that the police's interest at the time was purely financial and that it minimized the facts on the record.\nANALYSIS\n[13] My role is to examine all the evidence and determine whether the RPD's decision is correct.3 I therefore conducted my own independent analysis of the record to determine whether the RPD erred, as the appellants argue in their appeal memorandum. To that end, I considered all the evidence on the record, the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board and the recording of the RPD hearing held on July 29, 2022.\nInternal flight alternative\n[14] The test for determining whether an IFA exists is two-pronged.4 Under the first prong, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.\n[15] Under the second prong, the IRB must determine whether the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n[16] Both prongs must be satisfied to conclude that an IFA exists.\nFirst prong\nMotivation of the appellant's ex-husband\n[17] The appellants have failed to demonstrate that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment. The recording of the hearing shows that they struggled to provide convincing testimony regarding the ex-husband's alleged actions against them. However, considering the evidence corroborating their allegations, I am of the opinion that the RPD was right to assess the IFA.\n[18] At the hearing, the appellant stated that, after she gave birth to her son, her ex-husband never asked how they were doing and did not care about anything.5 She also stated that she had last spoken to him when the divorce was settled,6 in 2014. In addition, her ex-husband did not contest the divorce, and the divorce judgment arose from their mutual consent to dissolve the marriage.7\n[19] The evidence on the record does not suggest that the appellant's ex-husband attempted to regain custody of his son or to maintain a conjugal relationship. Indeed, despite the appellant's allegations, she did not demonstrate that her ex-husband is interested in going after her to obtain custody of his son; he has not made any attempts in that regard since 2014.\n[20] The appellant testified that her ex-husband had said during the divorce that he wanted his son. When asked to explain why her ex-husband did not try to obtain custody of his son if he wanted him, the appellant answered that her ex-husband was taking drugs, had a lot of debt and could not financially afford to do so.8 When asked about the steps that her ex-husband had taken to obtain custody of his son, the appellant confirmed that his only attempt was when he asked her to give him his son.9\n[21] The associate appellant stated that he had received threatening calls from his former brother-in-law and that he had not spoken to him in approximately four and a half years.10 He also stated that, since arriving in Canada, that is, since XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, the only thing he has heard about the ex-husband was in relation to the attack he had allegedly ordered against his sister. He therefore did not know what had happened to his sister's ex-husband, despite his in-laws' ties to the ex-husband's family.\n[22] The associate appellant also explained that he suspected his former brother-in-law of being involved in his arrest because the brother-in-law had asked in vain for his wife to return.11 He also asserted that his wife, who had stayed in India, saw the ex-husband lurking in the neighbourhood. However, this allegation is neither in the appellants' written account12 nor in the amendment provided in XXXX 2019.13 I do not find this allegation to be credible. This is a material fact that should have been reported in the appellants' BOC Form.\n[23] A determination of whether a claimant is in need of protection requires an objective assessment of risk, rather than a subjective evaluation of the claimant's concerns.14 The appellants have not been in contact with the ex-husband since 2014. They both assume that he is responsible for the associate appellant's arrest and the attack on the appellant. The argument that he still poses a risk to the appellants is purely speculative. The appellants have not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that the ex-husband is currently interested in them. Their family members who stayed in India have not had any contact with him or faced any reprisals from him. Nothing supports a conclusion that he is trying to get his wife back or regain custody of his son.\n[24] For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the RPD correctly concluded that the evidence on the record does not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the appellant's ex-husband has the motivation to pursue them.\nMotivation of the police with respect to the associate appellant\n[25] I agree with the RPD's conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the police are interested in the associate appellant.\n[26] The associate appellant stated that he had not been formally charged,15 that he had been released from detention after some wealthy people paid a bribe and that a condition had been imposed that he report to the police station each month. When asked who the wealthy people were, the associate appellant merely replied that they were wealthy people who had helped him by paying and having him released,16 which does nothing to clarify their identities.\n[27] In addition, the associate appellant stated that he reported to the police station three times, and added a rather important piece of information that was not included in his written account. He testified that he was threatened at the police station on XXXX XXXX, 2017. When the RPD asked about those threats, he stated that his legs had been thrashed with a stick and that he could no longer walk.17 He was also unable to state whether he had faced any consequences after he stopped reporting to the police station in XXXX 2017, repeating several times that he had left India on XXXX XXXX, 2017.18\n[28] I concede that these credibility issues may be insufficient to rebut the presumption of the truthfulness of the allegations that the associate appellant was arrested and detained for drug and weapons trafficking. However, considering that he was allegedly released after a bribe was paid, that the authorities did not formally charge him and that, according to his testimony, he does not appear to have suffered any reprisals for not complying with the condition to report to the police station each month, I consider that he has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he has the profile of a person of interest to the Punjab police, let alone to the police in other states. Furthermore, despite the 14 or 15 alleged police visits, his wife and children, who stayed in India, are still living at the same place and have not taken any special measures to protect themselves against police harassment or any potential reprisals.\n[29] In this context, I do not share the appellants' view that the RPD minimized the events in question with respect to the motivation of the police and that their motivation is merely monetary. The facts on the record do not establish that the police would search for the appellant beyond his village. The onus was on the associate appellant to demonstrate that the police are motivated to search for him as far as Delhi and Chandigarh. He has not done so. The case law has established that, if the persecutor has no desire to find, pursue and\/or persecute an individual, or interest in doing so, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no serious possibility of persecution or risk to the lives of the persons concerned.19\n[30] Consequently, I consider that the RPD correctly concluded that the police are not motivated to find the associate appellant. He has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he will be subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the police in either Delhi or Chandigarh.\n[31] In light of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in its analysis of the first prong of the IFA. The appellants have not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that they face a serious possibility of persecution, or that they will be subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in either Delhi or Chandigarh.\nSecond prong\n[32] I agree with the RPD's conclusion regarding the reasonableness of the proposed IFAs. The appellants have not provided actual and concrete evidence of any conditions that would jeopardize their lives or safety in the cities of Delhi or Chandigarh. In addition, the appellants are not contesting this conclusion, which is correct.\n[33] Considering the foregoing, I conclude that the appellants have not demonstrated that they would face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to relocate to Delhi or Chandigarh.\n[34] The RPD's decision is correct.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD's determination that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAnne-thierrie T\u00e9treault\nMe Anne-Thierrie T\u00e9treault\nFebruary 10, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Rico Quevedo v.

He lived with his family in XXXX in the Bekaa Valley, an area that is well-known for its significant Hezbollah presence and influence. He has XXXX XXXX and work experience in XXXX with a specialization in XXXX, including XXXX.\n[3] He claims to fear returning to Lebanon owing to repeated attempts by Hezbollah members to recruit him in XXXX 2021, given his very specific set of skills and expertise. He also claims that the discrimination he faces, as a stateless Palestinian in Lebanon, amounts to persecution.\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) did not dispute the credibility of the Appellant's assertions but found that his fear of being forcibly recruited by Hezbollah was speculative and did not relate to a Convention ground. It further found that the discrimination the Appellant would face, owing to his race and nationality (or lack thereof) as a stateless Palestinian, would not rise to the level of persecution.1 These findings are all contested on appeal2, and I will explain why I agree with the Appellant that they are incorrect. I find that the RPD erred in its assessment of the evidence, including the country conditions evidence.\n[5] The determinative issue before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) therefore relates to the Appellant's forward-looking risk if he returns to Lebanon. I find that he is a refugee.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n[6] The role of the RAD is to intervene when the RPD is wrong in law, in fact, or in fact and law. I reviewed the decision of the RPD by applying the correctness standard.3 I conducted an independent review of the evidence, including the audio-recording of the hearing. As such, I agree with the Appellant that the RPD had no meaningful advantage.\n[7] I am not making a decision about the admissibility of the new evidence tendered by the Appellant as I find that the evidence on the record from the RPD is already sufficient to enable me to reach a decision to grant Convention refugee status to the Appellant without an oral hearing pursuant to ss. 110(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nANALYSIS\n[8] On my own assessment, I find that the RPD incorrectly assessed the Appellant's forward-looking risk of forced recruitment by Hezbollah (see below - i.). I will also explain why the evidence on the record is sufficient to establish a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellant on the basis of his profile as a stateless Palestinian in Lebanon (see below - ii.).\ni. The Appellant's Risk from Hezbollah\na) The Appellant established a forward-looking risk from Hezbollah\n[9] The RPD did not dispute the credibility of the Appellant's assertions but found that his fear of being forcibly recruited by Hezbollah was \"speculative and not grounded in evidence\" as well \"based on hearsay from his family.\"4\n[10] The Appellant argues that the RPD misapprehended the evidence regarding his risk from Hezbollah who made repeated attempts to recruit him. He disputes the finding according to which Hezbollah would not have an enduring motivation in pursuing him despite his knowledge of XXXX and XXXX, repeated attempts to recruit him, and the threats made to him if he refused.\n[11] I agree with the Appellant.\n[12] The RPD is expected to rely on common sense when assessing the Appellant's evidence5 and it seems self-evident that the Appellant's knowledge and skills in XXXX and XXXX would be of high interest to an organization like Hezbollah. He did indeed testify to the fact that this was the basis of their interest and was asked to go to Iran in order train others on operating, assembling, and repairing XXXX.6 I see no reason to believe that the Appellant would no longer be of interest if he returned today, given his very specific, rare, and valuable set of skills.\n[13] It seems to me that finding otherwise rather indicates a lack of familiarity with, or understanding of, country conditions showing the involvement of Hezbollah in various conflicts throughout the region, its extensive security apparatus throughout Lebanon (and beyond), the fact that it controls and gathers all intelligence coming in and out of Beirut international airport (the only international airport in the country), as well as its known practice of recruiting disenfranchised youths and other vulnerable individuals to further its aims.7 It also disregards the Appellant's testimony that he was told his life would be ruined if he refused to work for them.8 The Appellant's belief that he continues to be at risk is further bolstered by the evidence showing that the Bekaa Valley, where he previously resided with his family on the outskirts of a Palestinian refugee camp, is entirely under the control and influence of Hezbollah and its member operate there with impunity.9\n[14] Thus, the Appellant's explanation that large pick-up trucks with tinted windows patrolling the streets in front of his house were likely Hezbollah members attempting to intimidate his family - in an impoverished area where they do not normally patrol10 - is not mere speculation but rather a reasoned inference based on his own direct knowledge and understanding of the socio-political context - which the RPD failed to sufficiently consider or understand.\n[15] Overall, I find that the past threats and interest in the Appellant - given his very specific, rare, and valuable skills - are sufficient to establish that he would continue to be of high interest to Hezbollah if he was to return to an area under their influence and control, on a balance of probabilities. There is no evidence that Hezbollah has lost interest in him or individuals with his specific set of skills.\n[16] I also find that the above-cited evidence establishes that Hezbollah, as an organization, would become aware of his return to Lebanon immediately or soon after his return through the intelligence gathered at Beirut international airport, the only international airport in the country. It further accounts for the fact that they did not continue to seek him through his family following his departure from Lebanon, given that they would have become aware of his departure shortly following the fact. It is therefore not surprising that they have not continued to search for him, through family members, given this.\n[17] In this respect, I find this case similar to that of Ali, where the Justice XXXX explained that the absence of continued efforts by agents of harm [the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) network in that case] could not be equated to a lack interest where the claimants had established a profile that would be of high interest to the TTP, and that the latter were aware of the fact that their targets were outside of the country, and had previously threatened to kill them if they return.11 It was also noted that their family members, who remained in an area under TTP control, could not be expected to put their own lives in danger by denying knowledge of or misleading an agents of harm as to a refugee claimant's whereabouts.12\n[18] Similarly here, I find that Hezbollah would surely become aware of the Appellant's return through the intelligence gathered at the airport and\/or in the Bekaa Valley, and the Appellant's family remains in the same area, an area under the control and influence of Hezbollah. It would not be reasonable for them to be expected to put their own lives in danger if questioned about the Appellant's whereabouts even if he attempted to relocate elsewhere in Lebanon to an area that is currently not under Hezbollah control. I will say more about this below.\nb) No state protection or internal flight alternative\n[19] The country evidence establishes that Hezbollah controls a powerful network extending throughout the country and is able to locate wanted individuals within Lebanon and would have almost no problem locating a person, if they were serious about the matter. They maintain significant influence over parts of the country, and in some areas, the government is unable to enforce law.\"13\n[20] Further, some reports explain that because of the closeness of Hezbollah and the Lebanese General Security, Hezbollah can find anyone in Lebanon through them, and Lebanese security officials could not oppose Hezbollah. It can kidnap people to its secret prison without publicity.14\n[21] Additionally, Hezbollah's role and influence in Lebanese politics has expanded in recent years, thereby consolidating their reach and ability to track down anyone throughout the country.15\n[22] According to a report by the European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity, the increased Hezbollah control of Lebanese politics suggests a growth in influence of Iran and the Assad government in Lebanon.16\n[23] In light of this, the fact that the Appellant's family continues to reside in the Bekaa Valley, and the overall situation for stateless Palestinians of the Appellant's profile in Lebanon, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that operationally adequate state protection is not reasonably forthcoming at this point in time for the Appellant anywhere in Lebanon, and that he would have no internal flight alternative if he returns.\nii. The RPD Incorrectly Assessed the Appellant's Risk as a Stateless Palestinian in Lebanon\n[24] In addition to the above, I find that the Appellant has also established a risk owing to his profile as a stateless Palestinian, and that the RPD incorrectly assessed this as well.\na) The objective situation for stateless Palestinians in Lebanon\n[25] The Appellant argues that Palestinians face harassment and a high risk of arbitrary arrest and detention in Lebanon, as well as discrimination and restrictions on access to employment, education, public health care, social services, and property ownership. He submits that this discrimination and mistreatment rise to the level of persecution and cites case-law establishing that the various forms of discrimination he faces should be assessed cumulatively.17\n[26] I agree.\n[27] As defined by the Supreme Court in Ward, persecution is a \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\"18\n[28] The country evidence indicates that stateless Palestinians generally do not have basic social, economic or civil rights in Lebanon, and that they face discrimination and racism both from the state and broadly in Lebanese society.19 Their right to residency and mobility is subject to arbitrary change, depending on the political context.20 They also face an elevated risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, and torture and kidnapping from both state security forces and various Palestinian factions.21 This is compounded by the fact that torture is a pervasive practice that is routinely used by armed forces and law enforcement agencies.22 The country evidence also establishes that stateless Palestinians have been discriminated against by the Lebanese state for decades, that they face \"deep prejudice\" from community members, and that there are few signs that this will improve.23\n[29] Further, access to employment is very limited for stateless Palestinians, who are barred from working in some numerous professions despite new legislation designed to improve their integration into the labour market, and they also face discrimination and barriers in other fields. The jobs offered to them are often informal, without insurance and very low-paying.24 Their access to health, education and social services is limited.25\nb) The Appellant's particular situation\n[30] The RPD considered that stateless Palestinians are in a situation no different to that of foreign nationals, also facing various restrictions in Lebanon. However, the country evidence shows that stateless Palestinians receive poorer treatment than foreign nationals - in particular owing to the difficulties they face in obtaining and\/or renewing documentation - because they are the only \"foreigners\" who do not have the nationality of a recognized state, and therefore the law, \"deliberately excluded Palestinians from owning, bequeathing, or even registering property\".26 They face \"widespread and systematic discrimination\"27 by Lebanon society; this is not the case for other foreigners or expatriates in Lebanon.\n[31] The RPD also considered that the Appellant's ability to find and maintain employment in Lebanon and his high level of education, despite the various restrictions faced by all stateless Palestinians, was evidence that he would continue to be able to access employment opportunities and that these restrictions did not pose a substantial prejudice that would amount to persecution.\n[32] However, it did not address or consider the Appellant's testimony that he was subjected to exploitation by his employer who took away a significant portion of his salary each month and did not pay him for all the work performed on the sole basis that the Appellant is a stateless Palestinian.28 This is clearly discriminatory and exploitative; I find that the RPD incorrectly and insufficiently considered this. I cannot agree that the Appellant should accept to continue working under exploitative and demeaning conditions and face continued discrimination. In my view, the RPD did not sufficiently consider this factor in its assessment of the cumulative discrimination faced by the Appellant in all aspects of his life in Lebanon. The RPD was required to assess the cumulative impact of all the bases of concern put forward together to determine whether they result in more than a mere possibility of persecution.29\n[33] It also seems to me that the RPD failed to understand the significance of the severe and pervasive discrimination he faced throughout his life, and the Appellant gave emotional and highly personalized testimony attesting to its significant impact on him, and his life.30\n[34] In fact, I find that the RPD failed to consider or understand the implication of statelessness to one's sense of dignity and ability to the effectively exercise basic human rights; instead equating the situation of stateless Palestinians to that of foreigners who happen to be living in Lebanon; this is a fundamentally different situation, and it would be an error to equate the two.\n[35] In Ward, the Supreme Court affirmed that the protection of human rights without discrimination are the principles underlying the 1951 Refugee Convention (Convention31). Human rights and anti-discrimination are therefore central to the assessment of persecution and whether discrimination amounts to persecution in a particular case.32 These are also principles that underlie the objectives of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) that include upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings.33\n[36] I find that this is significant to assessing the Appellant's situation as an individual who has spent his entire life being discriminated against and facing various barriers to accessing basic human rights in all aspects of his life, which he nevertheless managed to overcome to access higher education and employment.\n[37] The Appellant has argued, citing the UNHCR Handbook, that when assessing whether measures of discrimination give rise to a reasonable fear of persecution, it is necessary to consider if they produce, in the mind of the person concerned, a feeling of apprehension and insecurity as regards his future existence.34 I would agree.\n[38] It seems to me that the pervasive restrictions on the Appellant's basic rights, coupled with the real risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, ill-treatment and\/or torture he faces at any moment, throughout Lebanon, is more than sufficient to produce a real feeling of apprehension and insecurity in the mind of the Appellant and that, taken together, they show that a serious possibility of persecution exists if he returns.\n[39] Given the socio-historic nature of discrimination endured by stateless Palestinians living in Lebanon that impacts all aspects of their lives, the severe limits on their basic social and economic rights, and their heightened risk for arbitrary detention, arrests, ill-treatment, and torture by various actors operating in the country, I find that the potential mistreatment and situation that the Appellant faces is both serious and systematic. I find that it amounts to a \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\"35 and therefore persecution; the RPD erred in finding otherwise.\n[40] I therefore find that the Appellant would also face a serious possibility of persecution if he was to return to Lebanon, based on his profile as a stateless Palestinian.\nc) No state protection or internal flight alternative in Lebanon\n[41] As mentioned, both state security forces and autonomous Palestinian security factions are known to subject Palestinian refugees to arbitrary arrest and detention.36 Reports also confirm the widespread use of torture and mistreatment in detention, and government officials enjoy a measure of impunity for human rights abuses.37\n[42] Based on the above, I find clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming or available to the Appellant. Moreover, given that the systematic discrimination against stateless Palestinians is prevalent throughout the country, I find that the situation would be the same throughout the country. I therefore conclude that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the Appellant in Lebanon.\nd) Conclusion regarding stateless Palestinians in Lebanon\n[43] I conclude that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution based on cumulative discrimination in Lebanon, and that the current situation for stateless Palestinians in Lebanon amounts to a sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.38\n[44] In my view, these considerations have the potential to apply widely to other individuals of a similar profile.\n[45] There are several decisions from this Board - both recent39 and dating back several decades40 - as well as from the Federal Court41, recognizing the ongoing cycle of exclusion, suffering, deplorable neglect, misery, insecurity and despair faced by stateless Palestinians in Lebanon.42\n[46] I see no indication that this situation has durably changed, given the above-cited country evidence, and I agree with Justice XXXX's prior assessment that stateless Palestinians in Lebanon face systematic discrimination that jeopardizes their capacity to attain the essentials of a safe and healthy existence.43\nCONCLUSION\n[47] To conclude, I find that the Appellant's profile, skills, race, and nationality (or lack thereof) will place him at risk of persecution or harm if he returns to Lebanon, that this risk extends throughout the country and that no state protection would be forthcoming, as outlined above.\nDECISION\n[48] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nMarch 06, 2023\nDate\n1 RPD Record, RPD Reasons, at paras. 3-46.\n2 Appellant's Record, Appellant's Memorandum, at pp. 82-111.\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of China. She fears persecution in China because of her Christian religion and her perceived political opinion. The Appellant alleges that she intends to convert to Christianity after her release from detention. The Appellant also discovered that her son-in-law is a previously imprisoned political activist while he lived in China and continues to be active in the United States. The Appellant alleges she had no knowledge of her son-in-law's political activities until she was detained.\n[2] This claim has a long and complex history. The Appellant left China on XXXX XXXX, 2022, and traveled to Dubai for medical treatment, accompanied by her son-in-law (YZ). The Appellant used a genuine passport to exit China. After her medical treatment in Dubai, the Appellant traveled to the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and eventually to the XXXX XXXX and Canadian border near XXXX, Canada. The Appellant and YZ intended to travel through XXXX to XXXX, where YZ and the Appellant's daughter reside. The Appellant used YZ's mother's passport and United States green card to travel from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the XXXX XXXX and XXXX. The Appellant was discovered to be using a passport and green card which did not belong to her. The Appellant's genuine passport was found in YZ's belongings. The Appellant was detained by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) on XXXX XXXX, 2022. She remains in detention at the time of this appeal.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the claim on September 27, 2022. The Ministers' representatives for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PSEP) and of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRCC) (herein collectively referred to as \"the Minister\") intervened on the issues of Article 1F(b) exclusion and on credibility. The Minister submits that the Appellant should be excluded because there are serious reasons for considering that the Appellant committed fraud by using a fraudulently obtained passport.\n[4] The RPD rejected the Appellant's claim in its written decision on October 7, 2022. The RPD found that the Appellant was excluded under Article 1F(b) or in the alternative, the RPD found that the Appellant was not credible in her refugee claim allegations.\n[5] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its decision. The Appellant was previously represented by counsel at the RPD hearing. On appeal, the Appellant is represented by an unpaid representative. This representative was previously found to be a Convention refugee based on his political opinion in China.\n[6] The Minister is intervening on appeal. The Minister provided submissions in its Respondent Record. The Minister maintains that the RPD's decision is correct, and the Appellant should be excluded under Article 1F (b) and is not credible in her allegations. The Appellant subsequently provided submissions in reply to the Minister's response.\n[7] The RAD carefully considered all the submissions and evidence in this appeal.\nDECISION\n[8] The appeal is allowed. The RAD substitutes its own decision that the Appellant is a Convention1 refugee.\nNew Evidence Application\n[9] The Appellant presents the following items as new evidence on appeal:\na. Radio Free Asia article dated August 31, 2022, with website address included;2\nb. Rfa.org printout dated November 2022;3\nc. Radio Jamming in China;4\nd. Application for pastor's oral testimony regarding the Appellant's conversion;5\ne. Christianity Ministry Program itinerary;6\nf. Partial transcript and translation of the RPD hearing;7\ng. Response to Information Request (RIR) dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;8 and\nh. \"Guilty plea\" letter to the Minister dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022.9\n[10] According to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),10 the RAD can only accept evidence that meets at least one or more of the criteria under subsection 110(4):\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[11] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, the RAD then must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before it is accepted.11 All three criteria must be met for the new evidence to be accepted.\nSome of the items submitted were already provided at the RPD hearing and are not new evidence\n[12] The Appellant already provided an article about Radio Jamming and a printout of the Christian Ministry program itinerary at the time of the RPD hearing and so this is already evidence that has been accepted.12 The RIR is part of the latest October 31, 2022 version of the National Documentary Package (NDP). The latest NDP is already part of the RPD Record, and therefore, this RIR is not new evidence, as it is already before the RAD on appeal.\n[13] The RAD will consider these items along with the rest of the evidence on the RPD Record in its decision.\nRadio Free Asia article\n[14] The Appellant presents this article which includes the date of publication, web address and author of the article.13 This article was initially submitted at the RPD hearing so the contents are not new. However, the Appellant submits that the RPD drew a negative credibility finding because the web address, date and author of publication was not visible on the printout in its decision. The Appellant submits that the initial printout did not include this information because her browser cut off the web address and date when she first printed the article. The RAD accepts that the Appellant could not have anticipated that the RPD would have drawn negative inferences based on the lack of web address, date, and author. For this reason, the article is accepted under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[15] The RAD also finds that the article is new, relevant and credible evidence. On its face, the article's web address, date and author information appear on the article, and nothing suggests this has been fabricated. This evidence is new in the sense that these details were not before the RPD at the time it rendered its decision, and this evidence is relevant to the Appellant's claim regarding her perceived political opinion. Therefore, the RAD accepts this article and will consider this evidence in its appeal.\nRfa.org printout rejected\n[16] The Appellant provides an updated printout of the website traffic report for Radio Free Asia to demonstrate that her interview with this organization likely came to the attention of the Chinese authorities, given that many of the users who frequent this website are from China. The statistics showing the level of website traffic and usage is dated November 2022.14 The RAD finds that this evidence arose after the RPD decision was signed on October 7, 2022. Therefore, it meets at least one of the criteria under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[17] However, the RAD finds that the contents of this printout are not new. Under the Raza\/Singh factors, evidence must be new in the sense that it contradicts a finding made by the RPD in its decision, proving a fact unknown to the Appellant at the time of the RPD hearing or a situation or event that arose after the RPD hearing.\n[18] In this case, the Appellant provided a printout showing the website traffic between March and July 2022 from rfa.org during the RPD hearing.15 That printout showed that the total website visits in July 2022 was approximately 4.3 million. In the Appellant's printout on appeal, the total website visits in September 2022 was approximately 4.2 million.16 The fact that there are millions of users who view content from Radio Free Asia is not a new fact. This was already considered by the RPD, even if the RPD did not give this evidence much weight. Hence, this printout is rejected as new evidence.\nApplication for pastor's oral testimony denied\n[19] The Appellant explains that her pastor had assisted her in her Christian conversion via WhatsApp and was willing to provide live testimony for her appeal.17 The Appellant provides her pastor's contact information. The Appellant explains that her conversion took place on XXXX XXXX, 2022, after her hearing and before the RPD decision was issued.18\n[20] Respectfully, for new evidence to be accepted under subsection 110(4), the new evidence must have occurred after the RPD decision is signed and not merely after the RPD hearing. After the RPD hearing, a refugee claimant can still provide post-hearing documents before the RPD renders its written decision. The Appellant was represented by her previous counsel for the RPD hearing. There is no explanation why any evidence from the pastor, either in the form of a letter or affidavit, could not have been provided in post-hearing documents before the RPD decision was signed on October 7, 2022. Hence, the explanation of the Appellant having converted on XXXX XXXX, 2022, cannot be accepted as it did not arise after the RPD decision was signed. There is no reason provided for why evidence from this pastor could not have been made available at the time of the RPD decision. As the Appellant was represented by her previous counsel, the RAD finds that it was reasonable to expect that the Appellant would have presented this evidence to the RPD before the decision was rendered. Any explanation of this conversion is rejected as new evidence, as it does not meet any of the criteria under subsection 110(4).\n[21] It appears that the Appellant is also making an application to call her pastor as a witness.19 However, the appeal stage of the refugee claim process is not designed to be a second attempt to prove one's refugee claim. Oral hearings are only granted pursuant to the criteria in subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.20 Hence, oral hearings are not automatically granted to all appellants before the RAD. The RAD can only assess the existing evidence on record and new evidence that meets the requirements under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, and the three requirements as described in the Raza\/Singh decisions by the Federal Court. Therefore, the application to call the pastor as a witness is denied.\nPartial transcript of the RPD hearing rejected\n[22] The Appellant provided a partial transcript from her RPD hearings, arguing that there were significant errors in interpretation which compromised the outcome of her decision.21 The Appellant provided an interpreter's affidavit indicating that in XXXX 2022, she provided the interpreter an email with audio clips of her RPD hearings.22 The interpreter's affidavit is signed XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022.23 The RAD finds that evidence of alleged translation errors arose after the RPD decision was signed and it meets one of the three criteria under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[23] The partial transcript must also be credible, relevant, and new before it is accepted and considered in this appeal. After reviewing this partial transcript, the RAD finds that this is not relevant evidence. The contents of the partial transcript are confusing to review, and it is unclear where the errors occurred and at times, it is hard to decipher who is alleged to have made an error- the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) interpreter, the RPD Member or the Appellant having misunderstood a question. Unfortunately, the format of this partial transcript is poorly organized.\n[24] At times, the interpreter interprets the Appellant's testimony from Mandarin to English.24 Other times, the interpreter interprets the IRB interpreter's translation from Mandarin to English25, or the RPD Member's question from English to Mandarin.26 On other occasions, the interpreter paraphrases the Appellant's testimony and explains what he believes the Appellant meant to say.27 The transcript also does not provide complete sentences in its translation. In one instance, it is unclear whether the RPD Member did not finish its sentence or whether part of the sentence is missing, as the interpreter transcribes the RPD as saying \"well,\" with nothing to follow.28 For a transcript to be submitted as new evidence, providing a fulsome translation of the alleged errors in translation is critical. Since only excerpts are provided in this partial transcript, there is not much context given to some of the questions and responses given, making it difficult to assess the impact of translation error on the overall testimony. As the contents of the transcript and the errors are not clearly conveyed, the RAD finds that it cannot properly assess the relevance of this transcript. For these reasons, the RAD rejects this partial transcript as new evidence.\n\"Guilty plea\" letter addressed to Minister\n[25] The Appellant provided a letter to the Minister dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022, admitting that she is criminally liable for knowingly using identity documents which did not belong to her, so she could reunite with her family.29 The Appellant further explains that she is willing to take \"punishments\" based on her violation of the law. She concludes the letter by indicating that she wishes the RAD to grant her refugee claim.30\n[26] The RAD finds that this letter is dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, which post-dates the RPD decision signed on October 7, 2022. Therefore, it meets at least one of the three criteria under subsection 110(4).\n[27] In its Respondent's Record, the Minister submits that this guilty plea is credible as it is part of the Appellant Record.31 It is relevant because exclusion is central to the issue on appeal. It is new because this is an admission in writing that was not before the RPD.32\n[28] The RAD agrees with the Minister and finds that this letter meets the three criteria under Raza\/Singh. The RAD has concerns about the contents of this letter unrelated to the new evidence analysis. However, the RAD will provide a more fulsome analysis of this letter and give it the weight it is due, later in this decision.\nOral hearing request denied\n[29] The Appellant is requesting an oral hearing pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.33 However, an oral hearing can only be granted for the RAD to question the Appellant on the new evidence which it has accepted. In this case, the RAD has only accepted the Appellant's Radio Free Asia article and the \"guilty plea\" letter to the Minister. The RAD does not find that accepting or rejecting this evidence would justify allowing or rejecting the claim altogether. The RAD finds that this the exclusion analysis as described under Article 1F(b) requires the decision maker to consider many factors aside from a person admitting fault. Furthermore, the RAD does not find the evidence from the article alone to justify allowing or rejecting the claim altogether, as the RAD also relies on other parts of the Appellant's testimony in rendering a final decision on her real or perceived political opinion. Therefore, the RAD rejects the request for an oral hearing.\nStandard of review\n[30] The role of the RAD is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.34\nAppellant is not excluded under Article 1F(b)\n[31] In its independent assessment, the RAD finds that there are serious reasons for considering that the Appellant committed a crime, by using a passport and green card that did not belong to her, to reunite with her family.\n[32] However, the RAD does not find that the Appellant's crime amounts to the threshold of a \"serious crime\". The RAD finds that the RPD erred in weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors and the sentencing range factor. Hence, the RAD does not find that there are serious reasons for considering that the Appellant has committed a serious crime. The RAD's full assessment is below.\nEXCLUSION ANALYSIS\nLegal framework\n[33] The RAD will briefly reiterate the following legal principles guiding its assessment. Article 1F(b), as set out in the IRPA, states the following [emphasis added]:\nArticle 1F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\na) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\nb) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;\nc) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n[34] Section 98 of the IRPA indicates that a person who meets the criteria in section E or F of Article 1 of the Convention is excluded from making a refugee claim and, therefore, not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.35\n[35] Hence, if the Appellant is found to meet the criteria described in Article 1F(b), then she is excluded from being found to be a refugee and having Canada's surrogate protection, and the merits of her claim will not be considered.\nAppellant's identity fraud does not meet the threshold of being a serious crime\n[36] A crime must also meet the threshold of \"serious\" for a refugee claimant to be excluded from making a refugee claim in Canada. To determine whether a crime is \"serious,\" as described in Article 1F(b), the Federal Court of Appeal in Jayasekara indicates that the following factors must be evaluated:\na. elements of the crime;\nb. the mode of prosecution;\nc. the penalty prescribed;\nd. the facts; and\ne. the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction.36\nElements of the crime\n[37] The RPD found that there were serious reasons to consider that the Appellant used this fraudulently obtained passport to gain an advantage for herself, pursuant to section 403(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada (CCC).37 She did not have a valid visa, she was willing to travel though various countries with no valid visa for the purpose of reuniting with her family.38 She was not aware of her son-in-law's political activities until after she reached Canada, so her initial purpose of using a fraudulent document was not connected to her fleeing China for her protection.39\n[38] In this claim, the RAD agrees with the first part of the RPD's assessment. In its decision, the RPD found that the Appellant admitted to using a passport and green card which did not belong to her on her journey to Canada. The Appellant also conceded that she knew these documents belonged to YZ, despite simply following his instructions. The RAD finds that the Appellant's actions meet the elements of the offence as described in section 403(1) of the CCC below [emphasis added]:\nIdentity fraud\n403 (1) Everyone commits an offence who fraudulently personates another person, living or dead,\n(a) with intent to gain advantage for themselves or another person;\n(b) with intent to obtain any property or an interest in any property;\n(c) with intent to cause disadvantage to the person being personated or another person; or\n(d) with intent to avoid arrest or prosecution or to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), personating a person includes pretending to be the person or using the person's identity information - whether by itself or in combination with identity information pertaining to any person - as if it pertains to the person using it.40\n[39] The Appellant admits that she used YZ's mother's identity documents to travel to the United States to reunite with family.41 The RAD finds that the Appellant misrepresented her identity for her own personal gain. Therefore, the RAD finds that if convicted in Canada, the Appellant would likely be found guilty of identity fraud, contrary to section 403(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nMode of prosecution\n[40] The RPD correctly found that section 403(1) is a hybrid offence, meaning that if the Appellant were convicted of identity fraud, she could be prosecuted either by indictment or by way of summary conviction.\n[41] Section 403(3) of the CCC is as follows:\n403 (3) Everyone who commits an offence under subsection (1)\n(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years; or\n(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.42\n[42] If the Appellant's offence were to be prosecuted by way of summary conviction, Section 787 (1) of the CCC indicates the following:\n787 (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, every person who is convicted of an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more than $5,000 or to a term of imprisonment of not more than two years less a day, or to both.43\n[43] The RAD finds that there is a wide range of potential sentences available for the Appellant, depending on whether she would be prosecuted by indictment or by way of summary conviction. The Appellant could receive up to 10 years imprisonment or at the very least, a monetary fine of not more than $5,000.\nPenalty prescribed\n[44] The Appellant has not been charged with any criminal offence in any country, so there has not been any penalty prescribed.\nThe facts\n[45] The facts are not being challenged by any party to this proceeding. The Appellant knowingly used her son-in-law (YZ)'s mother's passport and green card to travel through various countries to her destination in the United States to reunite with her daughter and grandchild. The Appellant did not know about her son-in-law's political profile until after she was detained by CBSA in custody on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022. The Appellant only admitted that the identity documents were not her own when her genuine passport was found in YZ's bag. Her genuine personal identity and citizenship are not in dispute.\nAggravating factors\n[46] The RPD found that there were numerous aggravating factors in the Appellant's claim. They include the following:\na. The Appellant lied to United States Border Officers when questioned about the fraudulently obtained identity documents she used to enter the United States. The Appellant only admitted her wrongdoing once her genuine passport was found in YZ's bag.44\nb. The Appellant traveled under a different identity and used these documents to enter XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and then XXXX XXXX. The repeated use of a different identity is aggravating.45\nc. The Appellant decided to use the fraudulently obtained identity documents to travel after her United States visa was refused in 2019. The Appellant's goal was to reunite with family. The RPD found that this was not a criminal purpose, but also not a compelling one.46\n[47] The RAD agrees that dishonesty to immigration border controls is an aggravating factor. The RAD also agrees that using fraudulently obtained identity documents to travel through multiple countries is an aggravating factor. However, the RAD notes that the use of these identity documents were all part of the same singular journey, to travel to the United States. This is different from a situation where a person may have regularly assumed a false identity to travel on various voyages over the years. While it is aggravating that the Appellant misrepresented her identity to immigration authorities in different countries, the RAD finds that the degree of aggravation is less than it would be, had the Appellant been a perpetual traveller with a false identity.\n[48] The RAD disagrees that the purpose of the Appellant's travel is an aggravating factor. The RAD also finds that reuniting with family is not a compelling reason for mispresenting one's identity. However, while it is not compelling, the RAD also does not find it to be aggravating.\nMitigating factors\n[49] In its decision, the RPD acknowledged mitigating factors including the Appellant's lack of criminal history.47 The RPD also found that the Appellant did not commit identity fraud for criminal purposes, for profit or for the benefit of or direction or in association with a criminal organization.48\n[50] The RAD agrees with the RPD's assessment of the mitigating factors. However, the RAD finds that there are many other mitigating factors which the RPD did not consider.\nNature of offence lacks violence, illicit drugs or weapons\n[51] In assessing the seriousness of the crime, the RAD considers Narkaj, where the Federal Court faulted the RPD for not considering mitigating factors including the absence of violence, the absence of any use of alcohol, drugs, or paraphernalia.49 In Jayasekara, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) provides guidance on the nature of certain offences that could exclude a person from making a refugee claim. The FCA held that the harm caused to the victim or society, the use of a weapon, the involvement of a criminal organization would be relevant factors to consider in assessing seriousness.50 The FCA also considered that the presumption of a serious crime might be considered in offences such as homicide, rape, child molesting, wounding, arson, drugs traffic, and armed robbery.51\n[52] In this case, RAD finds that the RPD did not consider that the nature of the Appellant's crime also lacked violence, drugs, or weapons. The Appellant is not part of an organized criminal group. The nature of the Appellant's actions is not remotely comparable to any of the violent and heinous crimes described by the FCA in Jayasekara. The RAD finds this to be a significant mitigating factor.\nHarm to society is minimal and Appellant did not commit a crime to fulfill a criminal purpose\n[53] The RAD acknowledges that using fraudulently obtained identity documents to travel is harmful to the integrity of a country's immigration system. However, the RAD finds that the harm to Canadian society to be minimal. The Appellant's use of these identity documents was to fulfil a private purpose, namely, to reunite with her family. The Appellant relied on her son-in-law's mother's identity documents without her permission. The Appellant had no economic benefit from her actions and did not economically deprive another person. The Appellant was not entering the United States and Canada to fulfill a criminal purpose. The RAD finds this to be a mitigating factor.\nSentencing range\n[54] In its decision, the RPD considered that YZ was charged under section 131 of the IRPA for counseling the Appellant to misrepresent her identity.52 At the RPD hearing, the Appellant's counsel argued that under section 131, YZ would only be subjected to a maximum of six months imprisonment, which is far below the 10 year or more yardstick for a serious crime.53 Consequently, it is unlikely that the Appellant would receive a higher sentence than YZ. The RPD agreed that the Appellant would be unlikely to receive a higher end sentence than YZ. However, the RPD concluded that sentencing range was only one of the factors to consider in an exclusion analysis. Considering all the factors, the RPD found that the crime committed met the threshold of being a serious crime.54\n[55] The RAD disagrees with the RPD's assessment of the sentencing range as being a minimal mitigating factor. The RAD agrees that the Appellant, if convicted by a court of law in Canada, would likely fall on the lower end of the sentencing spectrum; however, the RAD finds this to be a significant mitigating factor.\n[56] In Febles, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the ten-year or more range is a good indication of the seriousness of the crime and creates a rebuttable presumption.55 Hence, the severity of a criminal sentence generally reflects how seriously a court of law treats the impact of an offender's wrongdoing on its victims and society. The RAD considers this principle and the Appellant's likely low sentence range. Section 403(1) of the CCC is a hybrid offence, meaning that if the Appellant were to be tried for her offence in Canada, she could be prosecuted by indictment or by summary. The RAD considers the very wide range of potential sentences available to the Appellant from a monetary fine to the possibility of imprisonment.\n[57] Given that YZ was charged with an offence under the IRPA with a maximum sentence of up to six months imprisonment, the RAD finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant, if convicted in Canada, would likely receive a sentence well below the ten-year or more spectrum. The Minister has not provided any further evidence on appeal for why the Appellant's crime should be found to be serious despite the likely low sentence. The RAD is guided by the Federal Court's direction in Mohamed, Roshan Akthar Jibreel, and finds that this lower range sentence should not presumptively exclude the Appellant.56\nAppellant's \"guilty plea\" letter is given no weight\n[58] The RAD also considered the Appellant's \"guilty plea\" letter submitted on appeal in assessing the mitigating factors of this claim. The Appellant provided a letter addressed to the Minister, indicating the following:\nI have received a copy of the Notice of Intervention against me on XXXX. XXXX, 2022. I had my counsel read it and explained it to me, and I understand the nature of the intervention and would like to pledge guilty for this matter. I am entering my plea voluntarily. I understand that by pleading guilty, I will be admitting that I committed the crime which [the Minister is intervening].57\n[59] The Appellant further states the following at the end of her letter:\nI am writing this letter to you to ask for mercy and forgive me for my violations. I am willing to take punishments [based] on my violations. I do wish you could give me a chance to enter my refugee claim, I am really [fearful] to return to China. I do wish [the RAD] could approve my refugee claim at the end.58\n[60] In response, the Minister submits that the Appellant's letter confirms that the Appellant should be excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1F(b).59 The Minister further submits that the Appellant seems unaware that the refugee claim analysis ends when a refugee claimant is excluded from refugee protection, pursuant to Article 1F and Section 98 of the IRPA.60 The Minister also submits that this letter demonstrates that the Appellant unequivocally concedes to the offence for which she was excluded.61\n[61] The RAD has serious concerns about the Appellant and her unpaid representative's understanding of this \"guilty plea\", as doing so could contribute to her being excluded from making a refugee claim, defeating the purpose of an appeal. The Appellant does not seem to understand this very important principle, as she ends her letter by asking the RAD to accept her claim after she gives evidence in support of her being excluded and ineligible to make a refugee claim in Canada.\n[62] A plea of guilt could be a mitigating factor in an exclusion analysis if a refugee claimant admitted to wrongdoing prior to her arrival to Canada. For example, if a refugee claimant had criminal charges in her home country and voluntarily pled guilty and accepted responsibility. Pleading guilty after the Minister has proposed that the Appellant to be excluded is not a mitigating factor.\n[63] Most importantly, the Refugee Appeal Division is not a criminal court of law and has no jurisdiction to convict persons of crimes pursuant to the Criminal Code of Canada. To be abundantly clear, no actual convictions or legally binding pleas are ever brought before the Minister or a decision-maker with the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Minister is not a criminal prosecutor with the ability to pursue or withdraw criminal charges against any individual. The only role that the RAD, and every other decision-maker involved in the refugee claim process has, is to decide if there are serious reasons for considering whether a serious crime has been committed, in accordance with the legal principles set out by the Federal Court as described earlier this decision.\n[64] The RAD disagrees with the Minister and does not find it can assign significant weight to this letter. On the contrary, the RAD finds that this \"plea\" letter lacks probative value. Whether the Appellant wants to plead before a criminal court after RAD completes its analysis is not relevant to this appeal. Furthermore, the contents of the letter clearly illustrate that the Appellant and her unpaid representative do not understand the consequences of admitting \"guilt\", given that she is still requesting refugee protection, and this renders the \"plea\" to be less meaningful. For these reasons, the RAD gives this letter no weight in rendering its decision on exclusion.\nAppellant is not excluded\n[65] For the reasons above, the RAD finds that the Appellant is not excluded from making a refugee claim, as the crime of identity fraud does not meet the threshold of a serious crime. While the Appellant may be convicted of committing identity fraud pursuant to subsection 403 (1) of the Criminal Code of Canada, the RAD finds it unlikely, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant would receive ten years or more of imprisonment using YZ's mother's passport.\n[66] The RAD considers the context of the Appellant's actions. The Appellant's misrepresentation was meant to fulfil a single, private purpose of reuniting with her daughter and grandchild in Alaska. Regardless of whether it was the Appellant or YZ's idea to misrepresent the Appellant's identity, the danger to Canadian society is very minimal. This was a non-violent offence. There was no economic gain for the Appellant nor was any person economically deprived. No organized crime was involved. Article 1F (b) of the Convention is not intended to exclude all persons for whom there are serious reasons for considering that they committed a crime. The crime committed must also be serious, and the RAD does not find the Appellant's use of YZ's mother-in-law's passport to meet this threshold. Therefore, the RAD does not find that the Appellant's actions, even if convicted under Canadian law, are sufficient to exclude her from making a refugee claim.\n[67] The RAD will now consider the allegations of the Appellant's refugee claim in its inclusion analysis.\nINCLUSION ANALYSIS\nAppellant has a sur place claim because of her relationship to son-in-law\n[68] The Appellant makes her refugee claim based on her perceived political opinion and her religious conversion to Christianity. The RAD finds that the Appellant has a sur place claim regarding her perceived political opinion, given her relationship with YZ. The RAD will focus its inclusion analysis on this aspect of her claim.\n[69] The RPD accepted that YZ is a political dissident and had successfully claimed refugee status in the United States.62 However, the RPD found that the Appellant's fear of being persecuted by the Chinese authorities for her relationship to her son-in-law to be speculative on a balance of probabilities.63 The RPD considered that the Appellant participated in an interview with the Radio Free Asia program a week after she was detained by CBSA. The RPD found that there was insufficient evidence that the interview was published, on a balance of probabilities, and that it would come to the attention of the Chinese authorities.64 The RPD found that the Appellant and YZ lived very far away from one another when they lived in China, and consequently, the allegation that she would be persecuted for being a family member to YZ was speculative.65\n[70] Respectfully, the Appellant and her unpaid representative provides many submissions on issues and case law unrelated to any part of her claim. The Appellant also references parts of her new evidence to support her submissions in favour of her credibility. However, most of the new evidence has been rejected for the reasons described earlier in this decision.\n[71] In response, the Minister's submissions only concern the issue of exclusion and do not provide any new submissions or arguments regarding the Appellant's credibility.\n[72] Nevertheless, the RAD is still required to consider all the evidence on record. In its independent assessment, the RAD finds that there is sufficient credible evidence that the Appellant would be persecuted by Chinese authorities for her perceived political opinion, due to her family association with YZ.\n[73] None of the following allegations have been disputed by the Minister or in the RPD's decision. The Appellant is YZ's mother-in-law, and she is related to YZ through her daughter's marriage. YZ is a known political dissident in China and was previously expelled from his university and imprisoned due to his political activities before he fled China in 2017.66 YZ has provided scanned copies of the original court judgement and sentence from the Chinese government.67 He and his father have since received asylum in the United States.68 The RAD considers that YZ's family members have also become persons of interest to the Chinese government. YZ's father and grandmother were imprisoned.69 YZ's parents' property has been seized.70 YZ's previous girlfriend has also come to the attention of the Chinese authorities because her of past relationship to YZ.71\n[74] YZ's evidence regarding the surveillance and imprisonment of his family members because of their association with him is consistent with the objective evidence. China's authoritarian regime has become increasingly repressive in recent years.72 Chinese government officials continue to deny holding any political prisoners.73 However, human rights organizations estimate tens of thousands of political prisoners remain incarcerated presently.74 Government security forces also harass and intimidate former political prisoners and their family members. Authorities frequently subject former political prisoners and their families to surveillance, telephone, wiretaps, searches and other forms of harassment and threats.75\n[75] Based on the available evidence, the RAD finds that there is sufficient objective basis to find that the Appellant would come to the attention of the Chinese authorities because of her relationship with YZ, on a balance of probabilities. YZ is a former political dissident who continues to be vocal in his political opinion while living in the United States. Chinese nationals who engage in politically sensitive activities abroad continue to be monitored by the Chinese government.76\n[76] Since YZ fled to the United States, YZ's grandmother, parents and former girlfriend have all come to the attention of Chinese authorities. The RAD finds that this is sufficient basis to find that the Appellant herself could also become a person of interest if she were to return to China, because of her family relationship to YZ and perceived political opinion.\n[77] Furthermore, the RAD also considers that at the time the Appellant initially left China, she only informed them that she was going to Dubai for medical treatment in XXXX 2022.77 The RAD considers that the Appellant has since traveled to Canada and the United States with YZ and plans to reunite with YZ and her daughter. The Appellant cannot be expected to lie to Chinese authorities about her travels and her personal activities if she were to return to China. The RAD considers the overwhelming objective evidence regarding the Chinese government's efforts to monitor political dissidents abroad as well as their family members. The RAD also considers the Chinese government's involvement in transnational repression of its Chinese citizens abroad.78 The Chinese government has used illegal undercover operations to retrieve any of its Chinese nationals who may fall under the very broad category of engaging in corruption.79 The RAD finds that these country conditions give the Appellant a sur place profile due to her perceived political opinion. The RAD finds that the Appellant's travels to North America where YZ is known to reside, puts her at a serious possibility of persecution because of her perceived political opinion, if she were to return to China.\n[78] The RAD finds that the Appellant would not have adequate state protection, on a balance of probabilities, nor would she have a safe and reasonable internal flight alternative, given that the state is the agent of persecution.\n[79] For these reasons, the RAD find that the RPD's decision is in error. The Minister has not met its onus to exclude the Appellant. The RAD finds that the Appellant is a Convention refugee because of her perceived political opinion.\nCONCLUSION\n[80] The appeal is allowed. The RAD substitutes its own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee based on her perceived political opinion.\n(signed)\nM. Lee\nM.

They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated December 6, 2022, rejecting their claim for refugee protection.\n[3] The Principal Appellant acts as a Designated Representative for the Minor Appellants.\n[4] The Principal Appellant's allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form1 and narrative.2 The Associate and Minor Appellants rely on the narrative of their husband and father for the basis of their claims. In short, the Principal Appellant alleges that in 2007 he began working at a XXXX XXXX where he met XXXX XXXX. While away in Dubai in 2018, he did some sightseeing with XXXX. A few months after his return to Dubai, the Principal Appellant was contacted by police and questioned about XXXX. His home was raided a few days later and he was accused of supporting Muslim terrorists. The Principal Appellant was detained and assaulted by police. His fingerprints, photograph and signatures were taken on a blank piece of paper. A bribe was paid to secure his release.\n[5] A couple months later, the Associate Appellant was home when their home was raided again. She was taken to the police station where she was sexually assaulted. She was released the next day. The family fled to Delhi and secured the assistance of an agent. They came to Canada and made claims for refugee protection on February 4, 2019. The Appellants fear that if they were to return to India, they would be harmed by the Punjab police because they stand accused of being supporters of Muslim terrorists.\n[6] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the Appellants to be credible and rejected their claims on the basis that they have access to a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Mumbai or Kolkata.\n[7] The Appellants submit the following:3\na) The RPD erred in its IFA analysis;\nb) Made erroneous credibility findings unsupported by the evidence; and\nc) The RPD failed to do separate assessments under sections 96 and 97.\n[8] The Appellants have not provided any new evidence for the purpose of their appeal.\n[9] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.4 I have considered the Chairperson's Guideline 4 related to Gender persecution in this matter.5 The RPD found that the Appellants have failed to establish that the agents of persecution would be able to or, are motivated to find the Appellants. The RPD found insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellants would face undue hardship in the proposed IFA.\n[10] While the Appellants allege they were not given proper notice for the issue of IFA after a review of the transcript, I disagree. I note that at the hearing, the panel proposed internal flight alternatives of Mumbai and Kolkata.6 Counsel did not request time to provide additional documentation or submissions. I find that the Appellants were put on notice that IFA was an issue at the beginning of the hearings and that at the end of the hearing, counsel was asked to provide submission specifically on the issue of IFA.\n[11] The Appellants allege in their memo that the RPD made erroneous credibility findings that are unsupported by the evidence. I disagree. The RPD clearly notes in its decision that it accepts the Appellants' allegations and their documentary evidence as credible however, that it could not find the proposed IFA locations unreasonable in all the circumstances of the case.\n[12] In relation to the Appellants' allegation that the panel failed to provide separate analysis under sections 96 and 97, I note that the panel clearly states which section of IRPA they are assessing each individual claim in this matter and makes a finding that the Appellants are credible but have access to a viable internal flight alternative.\n[13] Having conducted an independent assessment of all the evidence in the case, I find that the Appellants have failed to establish that they do not have a viable IFA in Mumbai or Kolkata.\nANALYSIS OF MERITS OF APPEAL\nAppellants have a viable IFA in Mumbai or Kolkata\n[14] At the outset of the hearing, the RPD identified IFA as a potential issue and the locations of Mumbai and Kolkata were noted. The RPD Member found that IFA was the determinative issue and rejected the Appellants' claims for refugee protection based on the availability of a viable IFA in both locations. I am not persuaded by the Appellants' argument that the RPD erred in its IFA finding.\n[15] After an independent review of the RPD Record and the transcript of the RPD hearing, I also find that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Mumbai and Kolkata. I have considered the totality of the evidence and find that there is not a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellants in the IFA location, nor is it unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to either of the proposed location.\n[16] In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, I have considered the two-prong test from Thirunavukkarasu.7 I must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the Appellants being persecuted in the part of the country in which an IFA exists. Furthermore, conditions in that part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, to seek refuge there. The Appellants bear the burden of proof to show that he would be persecuted under one of the Convention grounds, or be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of India, and specifically in the potential IFA locations of Mumbai and Kolkata. I find that the Appellants have not met this burden.\n[17] International refugee protection is surrogate (that is, substitute) protection that only comes into play if a claimant does not have an IFA in their country of citizenship. The onus is on the Appellants to demonstrate that they do not have a viable IFA in their home country. In other words, a location to which they could relocate where they could live without experiencing persecution or the kind of serious harm that would make them persons in need of protection. The IFA analysis contains two prongs:8\n1) The decision maker must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Appellants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA location or a likelihood that they would be subjected personally to one of the types of harm that would make them persons in need of protection there.\n2) The conditions in the part of the country under consideration must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the Appellants to seek refuge there. The threshold for unreasonableness is a very high one and requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.9\nFirst prong of the IFA test\n[18] I do not agree with counsel's submission that the Appellants would not have a viable IFA in India due to who the agent of persecution is, as well as their access to the tenant verification system, police databases, Aadhaar or the Central Monitoring System.\n[19] As the Federal Court has made clear, the question of whether an IFA exists is a factual one and documentary evidence may be insufficient to substantiate a refugee claim if the claimant does not establish a connection between the evidence and their specific situation.10 As noted above, the Principal Appellant alleges that he is still of interest to the Punjabi police because they believe that he supports Muslim militants. The Appellants allege that the police continue to contact the Principal Appellant's family in search of him, with the last visit occurring in XXXX of 2020. The Principal Appellant also noted that the Punjab police sought him in another state in 2019, but it was at a home of a family member after his wife disclosed to the police that he was in Delhi.11\n[20] I have considered this evidence and I agree with the RPD that this information alone does not establish that the Punjabi police would launch a country-wide search to locate the Appellants to have them assist in the search of XXXX. Furthermore, the Principal Appellant's evidence was that the police sought the family to access information to determine the whereabouts of XXXX XXXX and I note that the Principal Appellant has had no contact with him since 2018.12 There is no evidence before me that he remains at large or wanted by the Punjabi police.\n[21] I find that the Principal Appellant's assertions regarding the alleged motivation of the agents of persecution to track him down and seriously harm the family in the IFA cities to be speculative. There was no evidence, beyond their own assertions, to support the claim that the Punjabi police would have the motivation to expend the time and resources to track him down in the IFA city if the family was to relocate there, some four years after their departure from India. I note that the Principal and Associate Appellants noted that they were never charged with a crime, there was no warrants for their arrest and to their knowledge they were not wanted for any crime.13 No First Information Reports (FIRs) were filed.\n[22] When the RPD asked the Principal Appellant how he would be located in Mumbai or Kolkata, he testified that they would locate him with ease. He believed at the beginning they would be untraceable, but they would locate him when he attempted to rent a place to live.14\n[23] The Appellants argue that agents of persecution would be able to locate them through the tenant registration system or Aadhar card. Upon my review of the RPD Record and the transcript of the hearing, I note that neither the Principal nor Associate Appellant have ever been charged with a crime, and to their knowledge, no FIR has been filed against either of them. I note that the Principal Appellant was also permitted to depart India on his own passport from an international airport. The Appellants did not indicate they were supporters of Muslim militants or terrorists.\n[24] Moreover, the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India indicates that there is minimal interstate police communication, except for cases of \"major crime\" like smuggling, terrorism and some high-profile organized crime.15 The evidence in this case, if accepted, would establish that the police illegally detained and assaulted the adult Appellants because they were attempting to locate XXXX XXXX, an alleged Muslim terrorist. While it appears that the adult Appellants were detained illegally, the evidence in this case does not establish that the Appellants are involved in the kind of major crime that would motivate the police to engage in interstate communications to track down and seriously harm the Appellants in the IFA cities.\n[25] For these reasons, I find that the Principal Appellant has failed to establish that it is more likely than not that the agents of persecution have the motivation to track them down and seriously harm the Appellants in the IFA cities.\nNo likelihood of means to track the Appellant\n[26] I disagree with counsel that it is more likely than not that the agents of persecution would have the means to track the Appellants down and subject them to serious harm in the IFA cities.\n[27] In my view, the NDP for India indicates that the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) is in use in an increasing number of police stations and that there is a mandatory system of tenant verification in India.16 However, the evidence on both of these is mixed. For example, the evidence indicates that there are insufficient resources to follow up on all tenant verification forms due to the volume of internal migration within India.17 India does not have a centralized registration system or national database to track criminals or gangs. While police departments typically communicate with one another through the use of text messaging and email, in urgent cases other forms are used.18 In addition, the documentary evidence notes that police systems between districts and states are not integrated, thus \"police stations in India still work in silos as far as criminal information is concerned\" and despite being connected to CCTNS \"police officers on duty still continue with their old ways for registering complaints and FIRS on paper.\"19 Moreover, the evidence in the NDP for India indicates that there is little interstate police communication, except in cases of major crimes like smuggling, terrorism, and some high-profile organized crime.20\n[28] During the hearing, the Principal Appellant testified that no FIR was filed in his name and that he was not subject to a criminal case. He was able to leave the country on a passport, issued in his own name. While the adult Appellants' fingerprints, photographs and signatures were taken, in my view, the evidence in this case does not establish that it is more likely than not that the police entered the Appellants' names and information in any police databases. I also note that the Executive Director of the South Asia Terrorism Portal and the Institute for Conflict Management are quoted in the research report contained in item 10.13 of the NDP as stating that \"no official record of [extrajudicial] arrests is maintained\" in official criminal databases.21\n[29] In making my decision, I must weigh all the circumstances surrounding the adult Appellants' interactions with the police and whether their names likely appear in police databases such as the CCTNS database. In this case, the police never charged the Principal or Associate Appellants, nor is there any evidence that they filled out an FIR. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the police issued an arrest warrant to arrest the Principal or Associate Appellant.\n[30] When all of this evidence is weighed, I do not find that the Appellants have met their onus of establishing that it is more likely than not that the police entered their names into the CCTNS database. Therefore, they have not established that the police likely would have the means to locate them through the tenant registration process, as any likelihood of tracking the Appellants through that process would likely be linked to the CCTNS database.\n[31] The Appellants also argue they could be located through the Aadhaar card. As outlined by the RPD, the Aadhaar card is a 12-digit number issued to Indian nationals and is used to establish identity and obtain services such as education, healthcare and employment.22 The objective documentary evidence establishes that the data from the Aadhaar card is tightly controlled. This information isn't available in police databases, there is legislation preventing the sharing of the data and must be obtained by court order from a higher court.23 While the Appellants allege that the agents of persecution would be able to access this information, they have failed to establish how they would gain this access.\n[32] For all the above reasons, I find that the Appellants have failed to establish that it is more likely than not that the police or political goons would have either the motivation or the means to track them down and torture, kill or seriously harm the family in Mumbai or Kolkata.\nSecond prong of the IFA test\nThe proposed IFA location is reasonable\n[33] I have also considered the second prong of the IFA test, in light of the Appellants' personal circumstances. The panel is mindful that the Federal Court of Appeal has set a high threshold for the unreasonableness prong of the IFA test. Indeed, \"it requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\"24 The Federal Court of Appeal has also been clear that the personal circumstances of a claimant must be central to the reasonableness analysis.25\n[34] In assessing whether Mumbai or Kolkata are reasonable IFA locations, I have considered the Appellants' ability to travel safely to the IFA and to stay there without facing undue hardship.\n[35] In relation to the Appellants' argument that they are dealing with an agent of persecution who will find him anywhere in India, I have already found that this has not been established by the evidence. The Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the motivation or means to locate them throughout India. The Appellants have argued that the IFA is unreasonable because they will be located through tenant registration or the CCTNS, I do not find that these allegations have been established.\n[36] I note the Principal Appellant has a XXXX XXXX education in India, his wife has completed a XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Principal Appellant has worked in a XXXX XXXX and as anXXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada.26 The Associate Appellant was a XXXX in India, but has worked at a XXXX in Canada.27 The Appellants provided little testimony at the RPD hearing about what difficulties they would face in the proposed IFA locations, and noted in his testimony that he would be able to find work and practice their religion in Mumbai or Kolkata, but worried he would have to produce identity documents.\n[37] I find given the Appellants' education and work experience and their ability to adapt to a new location that they would, on a balance of probabilities, be able to find employment and have a stable source of income in the proposed IFA location. The Appellants are practicing Hindus. The documents note that there are approximately 80% of the population of India are Hindus.28 This would provide the Appellants a large religious community for support, if they were to choose to seek it.\n[38] The Appellants have testified that they speak, Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu and English.29 I don't not find that language would be a barrier for the family should they return to India. I am not satisfied that the Appellants have established that they meet the threshold required to demonstrate that relocating to the IFA location would be unreasonable or unduly harsh, having regard to all his circumstances.\n[39] The RPD also considered the Appellants' allegations that the police did visit their home and the home of a family member in India from 2019-2020 and inquired about their whereabouts. I was also mindful that not being able to disclose information on one's location with your extended network is tantamount to requiring someone to live in hiding. I find that this is not a situation where the Appellants would be cut off from their families and could visit with their families in their new location.\n[40] The Appellants have made other submissions specifically regarding hardship that the Associate Appellant would face as a returnee whom as a victim of sexual assault. I have reviewed the findings of the RPD, as well as the psychological report30 in evidence, and I agree with the panel and adopt its findings. I agree that the Associate Appellant has been subject to immeasurable pain and it would be emotionally difficult for her to return to India after what has occurred, it is not objectively unreasonable that she return to a new city that is a four-hour flight away from where the assault occurred.\n[41] The Court has been clear that \"the hardship associated with relocation is not the kind that renders an IFA unreasonable.\"31 While I am sympathetic to the difficulties faced by the Appellants in relocating to another city and that there would be a period of adjustment, I do not find this renders the IFA location unreasonable in their circumstances. A finding that a viable IFA exists in India means the Appellants would be safe in the IFA location and it is reasonable for them to relocate there. The Appellants can return directly to the IFA location of Mumbai and Kolkata which have international airports. Having considered all the evidence, I find that it is reasonable for the Appellants to seek refuge in Mumbai or Kolkata.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nKimberley Foreman\nKimberley Foreman\nMarch 23, 2023\nDate of amended decision\nMarch 17, 2023\nDate of original decision\n1 RPD Record, Exhibit 2.1, pp. 22-31.\n2 Ibid., pp. 32-33.\n3 Appellant's Record, p. 48.\n4 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They are a Sikh family from Punjab state who fear returning to India due to persecution by Indian authorities, including members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n[2] Their allegations are based on the Principal Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative. The Principal Appellant states that he believes in equality for all human beings regardless of race, religion, or culture. He claims to have been very vocal for the rights of minorities in India since his college days and that he became known for openly promoting human rights, including in his wife's home state of Uttar Pradesh. He testified that he supported the Shiromani Akali Dal-Amritsar (SAD-A) political party during elections, and he would explain to people their freedom to choose the candidate or party they liked.1\n[3] He was first targeted in Uttar Pradesh because he believed in equality for all religions. At first, he would get into arguments with people in Uttar Pradesh. He did not take these arguments seriously. Then BJP politicians by the names of IK and KT started to harass him because they did not want him \"helping\" people during election time. He eventually learned from his father-in-law that people were conspiring to kill him because people in the community wanted a pure Hindu nation. He was warned by his father-in-law to avoid visiting them in Uttar Pradesh, and he complied.\n[4] He claims his efforts to avoid trouble were too late. He states that, in 2014, he was framed in a false property dispute wherein it was alleged that he was stealing wheat from his own XXXX. He was arrested in connection with this lawsuit, held for three days, and brutally beaten. The matter proceeded through the courts, and he believes that the lowest court did not have the courage to dismiss his case and take a stand against police brutality. He was successful before the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which quashed the lawsuit as frivolous.\n[5] In addition to being a XXXX, the Principal Appellant owned a XXXX XXXX and several XXXX XXXX. He claims that, after the 2014 lawsuit failed, the police kept harassing him by impounding his XXXX without justification, which caused him to suffer huge economic losses. This did not deter him from continuing to raise his voice for justice and equality.\n[6] Then, in 2018, the Principal Appellant faced another lawsuit, this time filed by his father-in-law. The Appellants claim that the father-in-law was pressured by his community in Uttar Pradesh to file a dowry claim against the Principal Appellant, in an effort to break up the Principal Appellant's family. The Principal Appellant explained that it was quite easy to keep someone behind bars for a long time without a trial in a dowry case. He testified that he was unlawfully arrested for a second time and held for four days.2 The Principal Appellant was successful in having the court quash the dowry case.\n[7] However, before the court quashed the dowry case, the Appellants claim that their persecutors had published false articles in several newspapers defaming the Principal Appellant. The Principal Appellant began receiving death threats from the Indian authorities, as it was clear that their efforts to frame him in false cases had failed. The Principal Appellant's daughter testified that her father was threatened that they would hurt her, her mother, and her brother, if the Principal Appellant did not do what they wanted.3 The family became extremely scared for their safety and realized they could not live in India safely.\n[8] The Principal Appellant and his daughter left India first, in 2018. The daughter began studies in Canada on a student visa. The Principal Appellant worked on a XXXX in Canada. He returned to India in XXXX 2019 because his wife had a medical problem and because he had to arrange for his son's passport.4 The Principal Appellant returned to India in XXXX 2019 to bring his son to Canada. Then, in XXXX 2020, the Principal Appellant brought his wife to Canada.\n[9] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the Appellants to be credible and gave full weight to the documents submitted in support of their claims. However, the RPD found that the Appellants have viable internal flight alternatives (IFAs) in Mumbai or Bengaluru. It found that the agents of persecution were BJP party contingents local to Uttar Pradesh, including IK and KT, and the agents of persecution did not demonstrate motivation to pursue the Appellants outside of Uttar Pradesh. The RPD also found that the Principal Appellant did not demonstrate that he fits the profile of having advocated vocally for an independent Khalistan and thus did not face a serious possibility of persecution due to his political opinion. Finally, the RPD found that there was no serious possibility of persecution in India due to the Appellants' status as Sikhs.\n[10] On appeal, the Appellants argue that Mumbai is not safe for them because Mumbai was one of the \"first laboratories\" of the nationalist ideology of Hindutva and because the BJP is in power in Maharashtra, the state in which Mumbai is located. They submit that Bengaluru is also unsafe for someone who has been supporting Khalistan, as it is home to India's most notorious central agencies' cyber-units. They submit that both cities are unreasonable given that the Appellants come from a state which is different, both linguistically and culturally and that, as farmers, they could not live in big cities. The Appellants ask that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) allow their appeal and find that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nDECISION\n[11] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[12] The Appellants seek to introduce new evidence with their appeal consisting of four (4) letters from the Government of Canada which acknowledge that each of the Appellants filed their refugee claims on September 19, 2020. The seek to introduce this evidence in response to paragraph 10 of the RPD's Reasons, which states that they signed their BOCs in January 2022. They explain that, in January 2022, they were asked to fix typographical errors, and that is why the Principal Appellant and his wife signed their BOCs at later dates.\n[13] I reject the new evidence. I find that it is not necessary to admit the new evidence to accept the Appellants' submission. This is because the immigration forms contained in the RPD Record and the BOC forms signed by the daughter and the son all confirm that the Appellants filed their claims for refugee protection in 2020, and not in 2022, as found by the RPD. I accept the Appellants' submission on appeal that the Principal Appellant and his wife's BOC forms were amended on later dates (in 2022 and 2021, respectively) due to typographical errors. I note also that this evidence is not relevant to the appeal as nothing in my decision or in the RPD's decision turns on when the Appellants filed their claims for refugee protection.\nANALYSIS\n[14] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.5 In my independent assessment of the record, I agree with the RPD's credibility assessment and find that the Appellants are credible, and they have credibly established their allegations. I find, however, that the RPD erred in its interpretation of the evidence, including its interpretation of the country documentary evidence relating to Khalistan supporters, which in turn led to its erroneous conclusion that the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in India by reason of the Principal Appellant's political opinion.\n[15] The RPD accepted that the Principal Appellant was a supporter of the SAD-A party but that he was not a member and that he continued to be involved with the SAD-A while in Canada. The RPD found, however, that this evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that the Principal Appellant fits the profile of having advocated vocally for an independent Khalistan. The RPD noted that there is no evidence that the Principal Appellant has participated in protests or referendums committing to the Sikh cause, nor is there evidence that the Principal Appellant has advocated for Khalistan while in Canada.\n[16] I view the evidence differently than the RPD. The Principal Appellant testified that BJP supporters threatened to kill him and his family because he is connected to the SAD-A, a political party which advocates for Khalistan and the rights of Sikh people.6 Country documentary evidence confirms that the objective of the SAD-A is the creation of a separate Sikh country, called Khalistan7 and that SAD-A members engage in activism, which includes participating in religious and political events and protests as well as advocating for and attempting to garner support for Khalistan. I find that this evidence is sufficient to establish that the Principal Appellant is an advocate for Khalistan.\n[17] I note that the RPD did not specifically ask the Principal Appellant if he participated in protests or referendums; rather, the RPD asked the Principal Appellant to describe his responsibilities. He testified that his \"job\" with the SAD-A was to tell people about their rights and to try to help them solve their problems. He gave an example that KT bullied a family to vote for the BJP, and he explained to that family that they should vote for what they want and who they want.8 He testified that he received threats for \"helping\" the people of Uttar Pradesh in the elections, and he was threatened to stop coming to Uttar Pradesh and to stop \"helping.\" Due to his support for the SAD-A during elections, and his implicit opposition to the BJP, the Principal Appellant explained that he faced repercussions by way of the frivolous lawsuits, unlawful detentions, and interference with his XXXX operations. While he managed to vindicate himself in the lawsuits, the death threats continued, and the Appellants ultimately made the decision to flee India.\n[18] I find that these facts demonstrate that the Principal Appellant and his family were targeted due to the expression of the Principal Appellant's political opinion. I note that country documentary evidence aligns with the Principal Appellant's narrative as it confirms local-level clashes between supporters of the SAD-A and members of mainstream Indian political parties, including the ruling BJP, and that members of the SAD-A are comparatively more vulnerable to state authorities than members and supporters of the mainstream national parties.9\n[19] The possibility of persecution is forward facing because the Principal Appellant testified that he continues to support the SAD-A from Canada, and from this, I infer that he would continue to support the SAD-A and Khalistan if he were to return to India.\n[20] Furthermore, I disagree with the RPD's interpretation that the country documentary evidence is mixed on the treatment of those who support Khalistan. The RPD acknowledged that there was evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) which supports a finding that Khalistan supporters face persecution in India (for instance, NDP item 12.8), but it concluded that the country documentary evidence was \"mixed\" because there are a number of significant items in the NDP (United States, Department of State report 2022 (item 2.1); Freedom House report (item 2.6); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report (item 1.5); Amnesty International report 2021\/22 (item 2.2); Human Rights Watch report 2022 (item 2.3)) that are completely silent on the issue. In my view, it is an error to give less weight to the items in the NDP which are directly relevant to the issue of the mistreatment of Khalistan supporters merely because there are other items which are silent on the issue.\n[21] I find that the Principal Appellant's fear of persecution due to his political opinion is objectively well-founded. Government, civil society, and media vilify Sikhs advocating for Khalistan as extremists and militants by default. The government is hostile to separatist movements. Security services are more likely to focus on Sikh separatists because they represent \"a perceived political threat to the unity of India\".10 Khalistan supporters are often implicated in false cases, and police forces harass Khalistan activists and their families and friends.11 People who support or advocate for Khalistan are monitored, often included on police lists for heightened security, and often charged in terrorism-related cases, which can result in being detained for years before being released due to lack of evidence.12\n[22] I find that there is no state protection or internal flight alternative because the state is the agent of persecution. The Principal Appellant's evidence is that his problems in Uttar Pradesh followed him to his home state of Punjab. Moreover, country documentary evidence confirms that police keep track of or monitor Khalistan supporters, and individuals who move to another city will continue to be tracked since that information will be shared. Based on my review of the country documentary evidence, I am satisfied that supporters of Khalistan are not safe anywhere in India and face persecution throughout the country.13\n[23] Accordingly, I find that the Appellants face a serious possibility of persecution in India due to the Principal Appellant's support for the SAD-A and Khalistan. It is, therefore, not necessary for me to directly address the Appellants' arguments on appeal that they are unsafe in Mumbai and Bengaluru because they are Sikhs. Also, in coming to my conclusion on this appeal, I have considered whether procedural fairness requires me to provide notice to the Minister that nexus and state protection are issues in this appeal.14 I find that these issues are not new as they are intertwined with the IFA issue as analyzed by the RPD. There is no unfairness to the Minister in finalizing the appeal without further notice.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] The appeal is allowed.
