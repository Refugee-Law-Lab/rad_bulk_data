    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Data Source: Immigration and Refugee Board. In the Fall of 2022, the IRB added the Refugee Law Laboratory to their email distribution list for legal publishers of RAD decisions. The RLL therefore receives new RAD cases as they are released for publication by the IRB. Also, in the fall of 2022 the Immigration and Refugee Board provided the RLL with a full backlog of approximately 116k published decisions from all divisions (RAD, RPD, ID, IAD). \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Unofficial Data: The data are unofficial reproductions. For official versions, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Non-Affiliation / Endorsement: The data has been collected and reproduced without any affiliation or endorsement from the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Non-Commerical Use: As indicated in the license, data may be used for non-commercial use (with attribution) only. For commercial use, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. \n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Accuracy: Data was collected and processed programmatically for the purposes of academic research. While we make best efforts to ensure accuracy, data gathering of this kind inevitably involves errors. As such the data should be viewed as preliminary information aimed to prompt further research and discussion, rather than as definitive information.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW \n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of Nigeria who alleges that he fears members of the Black Axe and the Neo Black Movement (NBM) because he was an anti-cult activist at his university and he cooperated with the police to bring cult members suspected of violent crimes to justice. While the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) raised issues with the credibility of the Appellant's allegation regarding an attempted abduction in 2003 as well as with his allegation of attempting to reconcile with the Black Axe cult in 2015, the RPD ultimately rejected the Appellant's appeal because it found that he had an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Port Harcourt, and in Rivers State, more generally.\n",
      "[2] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its analysis of the first prong of the IFA test by ignoring crucial evidence that he submitted, including the Letter from XXXX XXXX and the Letter from the XXXX XXXX of Police. In the same vein, the Appellant further argues that the RPD overlooked country condition evidence showing that Port Harcourt was not a viable IFA due to police corruption in that city, as well as the state in which it is located, namely Rivers State. The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred on the second prong of the IFA test by failing to consider the challenges of the Appelant's ability to obtain employment and accommodation in Port Harcourt after more than 14 years abroad. To this end, the Appellant also argues that his past relocations should not have been used by the RPD in order to assess his ability to settle in Port Harcourt. Finally, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in relying heavily on the Jurisprudential Guide (JG)  for Nigeria since it is not law and, at the time the appeal memorandum was submitted, the JGs were being challenged at the Federal Court.\n",
      "[3] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) finds that the RPD erred in ignoring evidence that was central to the Appellant's claim for refugee protection and that this error impacted its final determination of the Appellant's claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DECISION\t\n",
      "[4] The appeal is allowed. The RAD substitutes the RPD decision by its own decision that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[5] The RAD must conduct a thorough, complete and independent review of the evidence presented.1 The RAD has listened to the recording of the hearing before the RPD and has applied the standard of correctness in the present case.\n",
      "No Status in The Gambia\n",
      "[6] The RPD found that the Appellant's legal alien status in The Gambia was dependent on his employment in that country, that his work permit expired in 2013, and that he no longer has the right to enter, live or work there.2 The Appellant does not contest this finding and the RAD finds no error in the RPD's analysis nor in its conclusion.\n",
      "Jurisprudential Guide\n",
      "[7] The RAD notes that the RPD decision makes reference to the RAD decision TB7-19851 relating to IFAs in Nigeria that was designated as a Jurisprudential Guide (JG) by the Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB). The RPD declared, in the decision, that it was guided by the analysis of the IFA finding in that JG decision.3 The Appellant argues on appeal that the RPD relied heavily on the JG, but noted that, at the time of preparing the appeal memorandum, the legality of four JGs (including the one for Nigeria) was being contested at the Federal Court. The RAD notes that, since perfection of the present appeal, the Federal Court has rendered its judgment on this issue, whereby it found that the Nigeria JG was the only JG under review that withstood scrutiny, stating :\n",
      "The Nigeria JG does not unlawfully fetter Board decision-makers' discretion or improperly encroach upon their adjudicative independence because it repeatedly refers to the need for each case to be adjudicated on the basis of its particular facts. For the same reason, it does not unfairly increase the burden faced by refugee applicants in establishing their claims. Contrary to CARL's submissions, the Nigeria JG was not improperly \"pre-selected.4\n",
      "[8] However, the Nigeria JG was revoked in April 2020 because of developments in the country of origin information that diminished the value of the decision as a JG.5 Based on the foregoing, the RAD will not rely on the revoked JG for Nigeria in its independent assessment of the present appeal and it is unnecessary, in the circumstances, to address the Appellant's arguments regarding the use of the revoked jurisprudential guide by the RPD since the information therein is no longer up to date. As such, while the Appellant submitted the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers Memorandum of Fact and Law for their Application for Leave and Judicial Review to the Federal Court to the RAD as new evidence under section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD finds that, given that the Federal Court decision in this matter has been rendered and has been considered by the RAD in the present appeal as jurisprudence, the Memorandum is no longer relevant and the RAD will not admit it into evidence, as a result.\n",
      "Credibility\n",
      "[9] The RPD raised two credibility concerns in its decision. First, the RPD found that the Appellant's testimony revealed that he did not have any specific evidence on which to conclude that the Black Axe was after him when he described the attack of the caretaker of the building where he lived in 2003 by four men, and that it was more of an assumption given his fears of that group. The Appellant does not contest this finding on appeal and the RAD agrees with the RPD's analysis. Second, the RPD found it problematic that the Appellant arranged for mediation with the Black Axe in an attempt to reconcile with them so that he could return to Nigeria. However, the RPD drew no conclusion on this issue. The RAD finds that the Appellant provided a sufficient explanation for this reconciliation attempt. He explained that he had tried to obtain reconciliation with Black Axe because his student visa was going to expire, he feared returning the country because of his previous problems with Black Axe, and the immigration consultant he approached for advice told him that he had to \"exercise every credible means to show that there is no way [he] could return to Nigeria, [otherwise] there was no way [he] could remain in Canada or even ask for a refugee claim.\"6 \n",
      "[10] The RAD finds that the Appellant was a credible witness. He provided testimony that was spontaneous, frank and extremely detailed. His testimony did not contradict any documentation he provided in support of his appeal nor any of the country condition documentation on the record. The RAD did not note any incoherence within his testimony nor did it note any omissions. As found by the RPD, the only factual allegation regarding his experiences in Nigeria prior to his flight from that country that he failed to establish, on the balance of probabilities, was the author of and intended target of the incident with the caretaker that he witnessed in 2003.\n",
      "Internal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n",
      "[11] The assessment of the availability of an IFA is based on a two-prong test. First, the RAD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility that the Appellant will be persecuted or at risk of serious harm in the part of the country to which it finds that the IFA exists. Secondly, the conditions in the part of the country under consideration must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the Appellant to seek refuge there.7\n",
      "     First Prong\n",
      "[12] The RAD finds that the RPD erred in failing to consider two documents that were submitted by the Appellant,in its decision, namely the Letter from XXXX XXXX8 and the Letter from the XXXX XXXX of Police of Lagos, Nigeria.9 Both of these documents contain information that directly contradicts some of the RPD's conclusions regarding the viability of the proposed IFA in the Appellant's particular case, and the RPD was therefore required to address and analyze these documents prior to drawing its final conclusions on the issue of IFA.10 The failure to consider these documents led the RPD to render a decision on IFA that cannot stand.\n",
      "[13] The RAD notes that the Letter from the XXXX XXXX of Police of Lagos, Nigeria contradicts several of the RPD's conclusions in the decision. The XXXX XXXX of Police indicates that Black Axe is \"a menace to law enforcement agents all over the country\", and that there are \"hundreds of cases under investigation concerning Black Axe all over the country\".11 With respect to the ability of the police to protect those targeted by cult groups, the police XXXX XXXX indicates that \"it is difficult and we do not have the capacity to offer continuous or lifelong protection to an individual that is under threat from cult groups\".12 With respect to the Black Axe's interest and motivation in pursuing their targets over long periods of time, the XXXX XXXX indicates that \"they have been known to execute long-standing threats against [those] that have fought against them or whom they consider as enemies\", that \"the length of time that has passed is irrelevant when a secret group like Black Axe is after an individual\", and that in his experience, \"they will never stop hunting the individual\".13 \n",
      "[14] The RAD notes that the Letter from XXXX XXXX, a colleague of the Appellant's in the Delta State Anti-Cult Group, describes that the Appellant is a target of the Black Axe cult due to the information he provided to the police that led to the arrest of five of their cult members, which led to the death in custody of one of those members.14 The author states that he met with a local chief and arranged for him to mediate with the cult for the Appellant to be removed from their wanted list. The author reports that, after two meetings, the chief indicated that \"there was no way that they will accept any kind of apology or entreaty from the Appellant.?15 As someone with knowledge of the activities of the Black Axe cult due to his own involvement in an Anti-Cult group,16 the author indicates that they want to exact revenge on the Appellant for his role in the 1994 arrests, but also because \"there are influential people who think that as long as he is alive and they are unaware of his whereabouts, he remains a threat to them because of information he has about them.\"17 Finally, he mentions that the Black Axe \"have syndicates everywhere\".18\n",
      "[15] While the RPD indicted that it preferred the National documentation package's (NDP) documentation because it provided detailed information about the origins of Black Axe and its level of power and influence in Nigeria,19 the RAD finds that the articles provided by the Appellant are all from reputable sources, including Human Rights Watch20 and other sources that are quoted in the specific NDP documentation to which the RPD referred. As such, the RAD considers the documentation submitted by the Appellant to be, at the very least, equally relevant to that in the NDP. In fact, the RAD notes that while the main document relied upon by the RPD in the decision - the Response to Information Request about the Black Axe21 - indicates that the Black Axe and the Neo-Black Movement (NBM) are not affiliated, the RAD notes that many of the other documents in the NDP22, as well the documents submitted by the Appellant23, indicate that they are either affiliated or use their names interchangeably. As such, the RAD will consider the documentation dealing with NBM as including the Black Axe.\n",
      "[16] The country conditions documentation that was submitted by the Appellant contradicts the RPD's finding that Black Axe criminal activities happen mainly in tertiary institutions and that, in larger society, they are only used by politicians to target opponents. One document states that the reach of cults in Nigeria has spread \"far beyond university campuses, with many groups involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery, extortion, oil bunkering, and various forms of street crime.\"24 The same document indicates that university cults are also implicated in \"widespread other abuses including extortion, rape and violent assaults.\"25 Another document explains that, while Black Axe first emerged in universities and is referred to as a campus cult, it (along with other campus cults) is involved in criminal activity and has been linked to political violence as well as to conflict in the Niger Delta.26\n",
      "[17] With respect to the proposed IFA in Port Harcourt, the RPD indicted in its first prong analysis, that the country conditions documentation submitted by the Appellant with respect to the proposed IFA in Port Harcourt did not name Black Axe as one of the cults operating in that state, despite descriptions of criminal activities involving cults there,27 and that none of the articles specifically confirm the presence of the Black Axe cult in Rivers State.28 The RPD went on to analyze the documentation in the NDP, finding that Rivers State enacted the Secret Cult and Similar Activities (Prohibition) Law in 2004, that the Black Axe confraternity and the NBM are banned under this law,29 and that Rivers State is not identified as having any Black Axe cult-related violence problems in the period of the 2008 to 2012.30 However, the RAD notes that the document in question listed specific incidents of violence involving Black Axe in specific states, but there was no indication that the list was exhaustive.\n",
      "[18] Indeed, the RAD notes that the documentation on country conditions that was submitted into evidence by the Appellant contains information that runs counter to some of the RPD's conclusions with respect to the viability of the proposed IFA in Port Harcourt. Indeed, the RPD relied on the fact that Rivers State enacted the Secret Cult and Similar Activities (Prohibition) Law in 2004 and that the Black Axe confraternity and the NBM are banned under this law.31 However, several of the country condition documents submitted by the Appellant state that the laws banning cults in learning institutions in Nigeria are not effective in stopping these cults from pursuing their criminal endeavours. For example, one document states that \"they are curtailed, checkmate but not eradicated - they now operate in hiding.\"32 Another document states that the power and prevalence of cult groups have steadily grown, especially since 1999, and that \"this is so even though some Nigerian states have passed laws expressly outlawing many cult groups.\"33 Further, with respect to the specific legislation relied on by the RPD, a document in the NDP indicates that :\t\n",
      "In 2004 the Rivers State government banned over 100 cults in the aftermath of violence that had affected the state with the sponsorship of these groups by politicians in the 2003 elections. Neither these attempts to ban cults or more recent initiatives to provide an amnesty for cult members (like the amnesty in the Niger Delta) have had much impact.34\n",
      "As such, the RPD's reliance on the legislation banning cults in Rivers State is an insufficient basis on which to conclude that Black Axe is not active in Rivers State, or in Port Harcourt specifically. \n",
      "[19] Further, while the RPD noted that the articles that described cult activities in Rivers State did not mention Black Axe specifically, the RAD notes that the documentation before the RPD nonetheless clearly indicates that cult groups are active in Rivers State and in Port Harcourt. For example, one document describes the killing of a suspected police informant by cultists in Rivers State.35 Another document from 2018 indicates that cult-related violence is not limited to Rivers State.36 Yet another document indicates that four suspected cult members were lynched after stealing a phone and a laptop in Port Harcourt.37 The RAD finds that, the fact that cults operate in secret and their affiliation is not often plainly obvious explains why many of the documents that deal with incidents of cult violence in Nigeria do not specify which cult group was responsible for the various crimes and criminal activities described.\n",
      "[20] To explain how the Black Axe would find him if he were required to return to Nigeria and relocate to Port Harcourt, the Appellant explained that he has confirmation that he is still wanted by the Black Axe,38 and that the cult hands out its \"blacklist\" to all new recruits. He stated that Black Axe has a significant presence in Port Harcourt and connections to powerful and influential people, many of whom were members of the cult during their university years. He explained that they have influential members in business and banking who determine who will get jobs and who is permitted to operate businesses in specific areas, and that if he were to approach any of them for work or to open a bank account, he could be found. While the RPD stated that the Appellant did not provide evidence to support these assertions, the RAD notes that this explanation is borne out by the country condition documentation, provided by the Appellant with respect to other cults that operate in Rivers State, and notes that the Appellant's credible testimony is evidence.39 He also provided evidence from a XXXX XXXX of Police stating that the Black Axe takes vengeance seriously, that they will not stop until they find their targets, and that Black Axe is active all over the country.40\n",
      "[21] Based on the foregoing, the RAD finds that the RPD erred in its conclusion that the Appellant would be safe from his agents of harm in Port Harcourt, and that the Appellant has established that there is no viable internal flight alternative for him in Nigeria. Since the RAD finds that the proposed IFA in Port Harcourt fails the first prong of the test, it is therefore unnecessary for the RAD to conduct an examination of the RPD's second prong analysis. \n",
      "State Protection\n",
      "[22] A state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except when there is evidence that the state is in a complete situation of breakdown. To rebut this presumption, a claimant must \"adduce relevant, reliable and convincing evidence which satisfies the trier of fact on a balance of probabilities that state protection is inadequate.\"41 This requires an assessment of the operational adequacy of state protection. As noted by the Federal Court, \"regard must be given to what is actually happening and not what the state is endeavouring to put in place\".42\n",
      "[23] The Appellant testified that when he asked for protection from the police officer to whom he was providing information about the Black Axe in 1994, the police officer informed him that they could not protect him and offered to provide him with a hand gun in order to protect himself. The Appellant also provided a letter from the XXXX XXXX of Police in Lagos  indicating that it is very difficult for the police to fight the activities of cult groups and that the police could not protect the Appellant given their lack of capacity to protect people over long periods from cult groups.43\n",
      "[24] Turning to the country condition documentation in the NDP, the US Department of State report for Nigeria indicates that the Nigeria Police Force is the primary law enforcement agency along with other federal organizations.44 The same document indicates that \"significant human rights issues included unlawful and arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detention, all the above by both government and nonstate actors,\" highlights widespread and pervasive corruption, and that there are few reports of prosecutions of officials who committed violations, whether in the security forces or elsewhere.45 Similarly, according to the UK Home Office, \"the police's effectiveness is undermined by a lack of suitable staff, funding, proper equipment and facilities, inadequate training, as well as poor pay and widespread corruption\" and notes that \"the NPF reportedly focuses its resources on protecting important persons, including politicians and wealthy individuals, rather than community policing.\"46 The same document also indicates that \"police officers responsible for misconduct and human rights violations are rarely held to account, fostering a culture of impunity.\"47 Finally, the document specifies that :\n",
      "police criticisms in Nigeria generally centre on the quality of the police personnel, their ineffectiveness and inefficiency in carrying out their tasks especially in preventing and controlling crime, manpower shortages, poor police attitudes and response to citizens, lack of essential police equipment and facilities and constant conflict and tension between the police and the citizenry.\n",
      "[25] With respect to police corruption, the Appellant provided several articles indicating that Nigerian police officers have been implicated in the protection of cult members from arrest,48 including some articles indicating that police officers have been involved in cult-related criminal activities49. The RAD finds that the country condition information, when coupled with the information in the letter from the XXXX XXXX of Police50 and the Appellant's personal experience with asking for protection from police in Nigeria, is sufficient to conclude that the Nigerian police would be unable to provide the Appellant with adequate protection if he were to return to Nigeria.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[26] As such, the RAD finds that the Appellant has established, on the balance of probabilities, that he would be personally exposed to a danger of torture, a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Nigeria.\n",

      "APERÇU \n",
      "[1] Je rejette le présent appel. \n",
      "[2] XXXX XXXX (l'appelant principal) est un citoyen de l'Inde. Il est un musulman sunnite qui vient d'Hyderabad, en Inde. Il prétend avoir commencé à entretenir une relation romantique avec une femme hindoue à Hyderabad en 2015, ce qui a fait en sorte qu'il a été menacé et blessé par la famille de celle-ci, famille qui désapprouvait leur relation œcuménique et qui leur a interdit de se marier.\n",
      "[3] L'appelant prétend qu'il a déménagé à XXXX, en Inde, afin d'éviter les membres de la famille de sa petite amie, mais ils ont continué de le chercher. Il prétend que les membres de sa famille et lui ont été harcelés, menacés et attaqués par les membres de la famille de sa petite amie et leurs associés un certain nombre de fois et que la police a refusé de les aider, lui et sa famille.\n",
      "[4] L'appelant prétend avoir décidé de quitter l'Inde temporairement pour voir si la situation s'améliorerait. Il s'est rendu au Canada muni d'un visa de visiteur le XXXX XXXX 2016. Il prétend avoir appris que sa petite amie avait épousé un autre homme en XXXX 2017; toutefois, il est demeuré en contact avec elle, ce qui a donné lieu à davantage de problèmes avec sa famille, laquelle famille a attaqué et menacé la famille de l'appelant à Hyderabad.  \n",
      "[5] Il est allégué que les membres de la famille de l'appelant ont déménagé de leur maison à Hyderabad pour aller vivre dans une nouvelle maison à XXXX en XXXX 2017, mais la famille de la petite amie les a trouvés à XXXX et les a attaqués à nouveau. Il est également allégué que des agents du renseignement du gouvernement s'étaient rendus à la maison des membres de la famille de l'appelant et avaient menacé de les arrêter en XXXX 2018; cela avait été orchestré par la famille de la petite amie, laquelle famille avait des liens avec le gouvernement. L'appelant prétend également que la famille de la petite amie continuait de le chercher en Inde en 2019.\n",
      "[6] L'appelant se trouve au Canada depuis XXXX 2016. Il a obtenu une prorogation de son visa de visiteur jusqu'en XXXX 2017. Après l'expiration de son statut, il est demeuré au Canada sans statut jusqu'en juillet 2018, mois où il a demandé l'asile. Sa demande d'asile a été instruite par la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) le 24 septembre 2019 et a été rejetée le 20 décembre 2019. La SPR a estimé que l'appelant n'était pas un témoin crédible et qu'il avait omis d'établir ses allégations avec suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles et dignes de foi. Elle a également estimé qu'il avait une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) viable à Mumbai, Kolkata ou Bangalore.\n",
      "DÉCISION \n",
      "[7] Je rejette l'appel. La SPR a eu raison de conclure que l'appelant avait une PRI viable à Mumbai, Kolkata ou Bangalore; par conséquent, il n'a pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni qualité de personne à protéger.  \n",
      "NOUVEAUX ÉLÉMENTS DE PREUVE ET AUDIENCE\n",
      "[8] Dans son dossier, l'appelant a indiqué qu'il présente des documents à l'appui et de nouveaux éléments de preuve avec son appel; toutefois, il n'y a aucun nouvel élément de preuve dans le dossier et il n'y a pas non plus de référence à de nouveaux éléments de preuve dans son mémoire. Il a inclus une déclaration sous serment dans son dossier1, mais il ne s'agit pas d'un nouvel élément de preuve, car elle énonce simplement les faits contextuels de son affaire et répète la preuve dont disposait la SPR.\n",
      "[9] L'appelant n'a pas demandé la tenue d'une audience. Au titre du paragraphe 110(6) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés, la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) peut tenir une audience dans des circonstances où de nouveaux éléments de preuve ont été acceptés. Compte tenu du fait qu'aucun nouvel élément de preuve n'a été présenté, la SAR procédera sans tenir d'audience. \n",
      "ANALYSE\n",
      "[10] J'ai pour rôle d'examiner l'ensemble des éléments de preuve et d'établir si la SPR a rendu la bonne décision2.  \n",
      "[11] La SPR a tiré un certain nombre de conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité contre l'appelant et a conclu qu'il manquait de crédibilité en général. Le tribunal a estimé qu'il y avait des incohérences importantes dans sa preuve et a également estimé que le rapport de police qu'il a présenté était frauduleux du fait qu'il ne cadrait pas avec la preuve objective dans le cartable national de documentation (CND) et qu'il y avait des problèmes avec l'apparence du document. Le tribunal a également estimé que la présentation tardive de la demande d'asile de l'appelant n'avait pas été expliquée raisonnablement et minait sa crainte subjective.  \n",
      "[12] Même si les conclusions quant à la crédibilité sont déterminantes dans le cadre de la demande d'asile de l'appelant, la SPR a examiné la question d'une PRI et a estimé que l'appelant avait une PRI viable à Mumbai, Kolkata ou Bangalore.\n",
      "[13] À la suite de mon examen et de mon analyse indépendants du dossier et des arguments présentés, j'estime que la PRI est une question déterminante dans le cadre du présent appel et j'estime que l'appelant a omis d'établir qu'il serait exposé à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution dans les PRI proposées ou qu'il serait objectivement déraisonnable pour lui de s'établir là-bas compte tenu de sa situation particulière. \n",
      "L'appelant a des PRI sécuritaires et raisonnables à Mumbai, Kolkata et Bangalore \n",
      "[14] La SPR a correctement énoncé le critère à deux volets quant à l'évaluation de la viabilité d'une PRI proposée3 :\n",
      "a. la Commission doit être convaincue, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le demandeur d'asile ne risque pas sérieusement d'être persécuté dans la partie du pays où, selon elle, il existe une PRI. \n",
      "b. La situation dans la partie du pays considérée comme une PRI doit être telle qu'il ne serait pas déraisonnable pour le demandeur d'asile, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, dont celles lui étant particulières, de s'y réfugier.\n",
      "[15] Une fois qu'une PRI est proposée, il incombe au demandeur d'asile de démontrer que la PRI proposée ne répond pas à l'un des volets du critère ou aux deux volets4.\n",
      "Les possibilités de refuge intérieur sont sécuritaires selon la prépondérance des probabilités \n",
      "[16] J'ai examiné l'analyse de la SPR quant à la sécurité des lieux de PRI proposés et j'estime que le tribunal a correctement conclu que les lieux de PRI sont sécuritaires pour l'appelant, compte tenu de la taille de ces villes et de l'endroit où elles se trouvent; de plus, l'appelant a omis d'établir que ses présumés persécuteurs avaient les moyens ou la motivation de le trouver dans les lieux de PRI. Je souscris à l'analyse de la SPR5 et je l'adopte comme étant la mienne. \n",
      "[17] L'appelant soutient que la SPR a commis des erreurs dans son analyse de la sécurité des lieux de PRI. Il avance que les PRI proposées ne sont pas viables parce que ses persécuteurs [traduction] \" [...] peuvent le retracer par l'intermédiaire de la preuve d'adresse du demandeur d'asile, de son argot et de leurs liens avec les groupes locaux et les sympathisants dans ces villes \"6.  \n",
      "[18] Je n'estime pas que l'appelant a établi que ses persécuteurs avaient les moyens et la motivation leur permettant de le trouver dans les lieux de PRI. Comme l'a souligné la SPR, l'appelant n'a pas été en mesure d'expliquer comment ils pourraient le trouver à l'extérieur d'Hyderabad, ci ce n'est qu'il a largement prétendu qu'ils avaient des liens avec le gouvernement.  \n",
      "[19] Je souligne que l'appelant a prétendu que sa famille avait été prise pour cible par des agents du renseignement indien qui avait été envoyés par ses persécuteurs. La SPR a estimé que cette allégation n'était pas crédible à la lumière de la preuve objective dans le CND. L'appelant ne conteste pas cette conclusion quant à la crédibilité. Je souscris à l'opinion de la SPR pour les raisons qu'elle a données7, à savoir que cette allégation n'est pas crédible selon la prépondérance des probabilités. Par conséquent, je n'accorde aucun poids à cette allégation selon laquelle les persécuteurs ont des liens avec le gouvernement.  \n",
      "[20] Je souligne également que l'appelant prétend que les membres de sa famille ont été trouvés et attaqués, et ce, même après leur déménagement à XXXXen XXXX 2017. Toutefois, l'appelant a dit lors de son témoignage que le lieu où se trouvaient les membres de sa famille avait été révélé aux persécuteurs par leurs voisins, car il s'agissait d'un lieu auquel ils étaient associés. Même si l'appelant a également émis l'hypothèse selon laquelle le lieu où ils se trouvaient a pu être trouvé par l'intermédiaire de l'enregistrement de la carte d'identité aadhaar, il a admis qu'il s'agissait d'une simple hypothèse de sa part8. Comme l'a souligné la SPR, la preuve objective dans le CND n'appuie pas l'allégation de l'appelant selon laquelle il pourrait être repéré par l'intermédiaire de l'enregistrement de sa carte d'identité9.\n",
      "[21] La façon dont l'appelant pourrait être trouvé dans les lieux de PRI en raison de son argot n'est pas claire. Il n'a pas expliqué cet argument, et je ne le trouve pas convaincant.  \n",
      "[22] Pour ces raisons, j'estime que l'appelant n'a pas démontré que ses présumés persécuteurs ont les moyens de le trouver dans les PRI. J'estime également qu'il n'est pas établi qu'ils sont motivés à le chercher dans ces lieux. \n",
      "[23] L'appelant soutient que la SPR a commis une erreur en ignorant le fait que, si lui et son ancienne petite amie avaient choisi de se marier contre la volonté de leurs familles, ils auraient eu des problèmes. Il se fonde sur la preuve objective qui établit que des crimes d'honneur et des meurtres d'honneur sont commis dans le cadre de mariages interconfessionnels dans diverses régions de l'Inde. Il ajoute que le tribunal a commis une erreur en identifiant la question de la persécution comme ayant un lien avec la religion musulmane du demandeur d'asile, alors qu'elle est fondée sur la relation interconfessionnelle.\n",
      "[24] Je n'estime pas que le tribunal ait commis une erreur en encadrant la crainte de persécution de l'appelant; en effet, le tribunal a reconnu que la crainte était liée à la relation interconfessionnelle entre l'appelant, un musulman, et son ancienne petite amie, une hindoue.\n",
      "[25] En outre, je ne dispose d'aucun élément de preuve démontrant que l'appelant et son ancienne petite amie planifient de se marier. L'appelant a dit lors de son témoignage que, même s'ils ont auparavant eu l'intention de se marier, son ancienne petite amie est mariée à un autre homme depuis 2017 et elle voulait garder le contact avec lui en tant qu'amie10. Je souligne que l'appelant a affirmé dans son mémoire d'appel qu'il [traduction] \" était en relation avec une hindoue \" [soulignement ajouté]11. Je ne dispose d'aucune preuve démontrant l'existence d'une relation ou de communications continues.  \n",
      "[26] Même si j'admets qu'il y a une preuve objective démontrant que les mariages interconfessionnels peuvent donner lieu à des problèmes et à des préjudices en Inde, je n'estime pas que l'appelant ait établi que sa relation était en cours ou qu'un mariage serait vraisemblablement contracté dans les circonstances.  \n",
      "[27] Je souligne également qu'il n'y a aucun élément de preuve qui démontre qu'il y a eu des contacts avec les présumés persécuteurs depuis XXXX 2019, soit depuis presque deux ans. J'estime que cette absence de contact donne également à penser que les persécuteurs ne veulent plus poursuivre l'appelant et qu'il est peu probable qu'ils le cherchent dans les lieux de PRI.\n",
      "[28] Je conclus que l'appelant a omis d'établir, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que ses présumés persécuteurs ont les moyens ou la motivation de le chercher dans les lieux de PRI. Par conséquent, il n'a pas établi qu'il est exposé à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ou à un risque au titre de l'article 97 dans les lieux de PRI selon la prépondérance des probabilités.\n",
      "Les possibilités de refuge intérieur sont raisonnables pour l'appelant\n",
      "[29] Le second volet du critère de la PRI consiste à se demander s'il est objectivement raisonnable que l'appelant s'installe là-bas compte tenu de toutes les circonstances. La SPR a estimé que les PRI proposées étaient raisonnables pour l'appelant compte tenu de la preuve objective sur les conditions dans le pays et compte tenu de la preuve sur sa propre situation personnelle, dont ses compétences en matière de langue, son éducation, son emploi, sa religion et sa capacité à voyager et à s'installer dans les lieux de PRI. \n",
      "[30] L'appelant n'a pas contesté la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les PRI sont raisonnables. Je souligne que, durant l'audience de la SPR, il a dit que ses seules préoccupations quant au fait de déménager dans les PRI proposées se rapportaient à la sécurité et à sa crainte d'être trouvé et blessé par ses persécuteurs12.\n",
      "[31] Je souscris à l'analyse et aux conclusions de la SPR quant au caractère raisonnable13 et je les adopte comme les miennes. Je conclus que l'appelant a omis de présenter une preuve réelle et concrète quant aux conditions qui mettraient en péril sa vie et sa sécurité s'il s'installait dans les lieux de PRI14; par conséquent, les PRI proposées sont raisonnables pour l'appelant.\n",
      "[32] Ma conclusion selon laquelle l'appelant a une PRI sécuritaire et raisonnable à Mumbai, Kolkata et Bangalore est déterminante quant à sa demande d'asile. Par conséquent, il n'est pas nécessaire que j'examine les conclusions de la SPR au sujet de la crédibilité et de la crainte subjective, et je refuse de le faire.\t\n",
      "CONCLUSION \n",
      "[33] L'appelant a une PRI viable à Mumbai, Kolkata et Bangalore.\n",
      "[34] Je rejette l'appel et confirme à décision attaquée selon laquelle l'appelant n'a pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni qualité de personne à protéger. \n",

      "a. The appellant is afraid to return to Haiti because members of his family tried to take possession of land that belongs to his mother. They assaulted his mother and also threatened the appellant. The appellant initially moved to Brazil, but he stated that he had to leave that country because of racial discrimination. \n",
      "b. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellant's refugee protection claim because it concluded that he was excluded from protection under the Convention.1 The RPD concluded that the appellant had access to permanent residence in Brazil and that he voluntarily failed to avail himself of that status. After analyzing his situation based on the criteria in Zeng,2 the RPD concluded that he left Brazil voluntarily and that he did not face a possibility of persecution or a risk in Brazil. The RPD also concluded that the appellant had an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Haiti. This led the RPD to conclude he was excluded from protection under the Convention.  \n",
      "c. The appellant is challenging the application of Zeng to his situation. He is also challenging how the RPD applied the criteria in Zeng. He contends that he did not leave Brazil voluntarily. He argues that he cannot return to Haiti because the criminals are still active and conditions in the country remain unstable. He is also alleging that the RPD chose only the aspects that supported its conclusions instead of examining the evidence as a whole.  \n",
      "DETERMINATION \n",
      "[2] I dismiss the appeal. The determinative issue is whether the appellant is a person referred to in section E of Article 1 of the Convention, which would mean that he would be excluded from protection under the Convention and could not be recognized as a refugee or a person in need of protection. \n",
      "[3] The evidence shows that the appellant had access to permanent resident status in Brazil and that he voluntarily failed to avail himself of that status. Moreover, the RPD correctly concluded that the appellant would have an IFA if he were to return to Haiti. The analysis of the factors in Zeng lead me to conclude that the appellant is excluded from protection under the Convention. \n",
      "ANALYSIS \n",
      "The Refugee Protection Division applied the right test to the appellant's situation \n",
      "[4] Zeng establishes the following test to determine whether a refugee protection claimant is excluded from protection under the Convention by reason of their status in a country other than their country of nationality: \n",
      "Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.3  \n",
      "\n",
      "[5] The RPD correctly concluded that this test applies to the appellant's situation, which he is challenging on appeal. The appellant is challenging the application of the second prong of the test in Zeng because he never acquired permanent residence in Brazil, a status that is substantially similar to citizens of that country. He states that, even if he had acquired it, he would have already lost it at the time of the hearing before the RPD, since by that point he had been gone from the country for more than two years. \n",
      "[6] I note that both the hypothetical situation described by the appellant and his actual situation are covered in Zeng. The Court explicitly states that if, on the day of the hearing before the RPD, a refugee protection claimant does not have status similar to that of the citizens of Brazil, \"the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it.\"4 The appellant is not challenging the RPD's conclusion that he could have acquired permanent resident status in Brazil but failed to do so. Zeng clearly states that, in such a situation, the RPD must consider and balance the various factors that it sets out. \n",
      "The appellant had access to permanent resident status in Brazil and failed to avail himself of it \n",
      "[7] The RPD correctly concluded that the appellant had access to permanent resident status in Brazil but failed to avail himself of it.  \n",
      "[8] The Minister's intervention in his refugee protection claim states that the appellant's name is on a list of 43,781 Haitian nationals who would be granted permanent residence in Brazil as long as they completed some administrative formalities.  \n",
      "[9] At his hearing, the appellant stated that he had heard that some Haitians could become permanent residents in Brazil, but he had not looked into it because he had already decided to leave.  \n",
      "[10] Therefore, the RPD concluded that the appellant did not have permanent residence in Brazil but that he had had the opportunity to acquire it and had failed to do so.  \n",
      "The appellant left Brazil and lost his status voluntarily \n",
      "[11] The RPD acknowledged that Haitian nationals might face discrimination and racism in Brazil, but it concluded that that did not amount to a serious possibility of persecution for the appellant in that country. For that reason, the RPD concluded that the appellant left Brazil voluntarily. \n",
      "[12] The appellant is challenging that conclusion. He states that some Brazilians subject Haitian nationals to discriminatory acts and that he himself had been the target of Brazilians' hurtful remarks and jealousy. In the appellant's opinion, that meant that his departure from Brazil was involuntary.  \n",
      "[13] The existence of racism and discrimination in Brazil is not enough to conclude that it amounts to persecution. According to the case law, persecution is \"sustained or systematic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of 'state protection'.\"5  \n",
      "[14] The RPD correctly concluded that, although there is discrimination and racism toward Haitians in Brazil, the appellant failed to demonstrate that he faced a serious possibility of persecution in Brazil, through cumulative discrimination or otherwise. He failed to demonstrate that this situation was such that he would not have access to a job, housing or any other essential service, or that he would not be protected by the state if a discriminatory incident were to occur. He also failed to demonstrate this in his appeal memorandum.  \n",
      "[15] I conclude that the appellant left Brazil voluntarily, and this factor weighs in favour of exclusion.  \n",
      "The appellant can no longer return to Brazil \n",
      "[16] The RPD concluded that the appellant was not entitled to return to Brazil. The appellant is not challenging that conclusion.  \n",
      "[17] Although the RPD correctly concluded that this factor weighs against exclusion, it must be considered with all of the other factors.  \n",
      "The appellant would have an internal flight alternative if he were to return to Haiti \n",
      "[18] The RPD concluded that the factor of the risk the appellant would face in his home country, Haiti, weighs in favour of exclusion because he would have an IFA in Port-au-Prince. I agree with this conclusion.  \n",
      "[19] The RPD concluded that the appellant had established that his mother owned land that was the subject of a family dispute and that she had been attacked because of that dispute. However, the RPD concluded that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the criminals who wanted to take the land would be interested in him personally and would have an interest in looking for him if he were to move to Port-au-Prince. \n",
      "[20] The IFA must be analyzed in two steps, pursuant to two tests: \n",
      "- It must be safe. The appellant must not face a serious possibility of persecution, a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA. \n",
      "- Conditions in the IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in the circumstances, for the appellant to move back there.  \n",
      "[21] As regards the first test, the appellant is challenging the RPD's conclusion, stating that conditions in the country are still unstable, that the criminals are still active and that he would not be able to rely on adequate protection from the Haitian state. I conclude that those are general considerations that affect all Haitians.  \n",
      "[22] The appellant submitted evidence to the RPD regarding the culture of revenge in Haiti, where a threat can persist for many years. However, like the RPD, I conclude that it is unlikely the appellant would be personally targeted by individuals who wanted to seize the land and whose desire for revenge was such that they would be prepared to attack him no matter where he was in the country. \n",
      "[23] Furthermore, the risk the appellant faces must be assessed based on the assumption that he would give up any ownership rights he might have to his land and that he would stop defending his mother's ownership rights. The case law in Canada does not recognize ownership rights as a fundamental right that a person cannot be asked to give up, unlike a political opinion or religion. It has even been recognized that a property rights claim is not a basis for a refugee protection claim.6  \n",
      "[24] In that context, given that the dispute occurred in 2014, and assuming that the appellant would stop defending his mother's ownership rights, it is unlikely that the individuals who were threatening him in the past would have any interest in tracking him down in Port-au-Prince. In addition, the appellant's mother has left the country and the land is currently vacant, which means that those individuals could seize it. They would therefore no longer have any reason to harm the appellant's family.  \n",
      "[25] As regards the second test for assessing the IFA, the appellant did not submit any evidence demonstrating that he would face any undue hardship if he had to move to Port-au-Prince. Yet the onus was on him to do so.  \n",
      "[26] Lastly, the appellant alleges that the RPD took a selective approach in its reasoning and chose only the evidence that supported its conclusions. However, he does not specify what evidence the RPD ignored that contradicts its conclusions. After analyzing the appellant's record and listening to the recordings of the hearings before the RPD, I did not find any such evidence.  \n",
      "[27] I conclude that, because there is an IFA in Port-au-Prince, the analysis of the risk that the appellant faces in Haiti weighs in favour of his exclusion from protection under the Convention. \n",
      "Excluding the appellant would not breach Canada's international obligations \n",
      "[28] According to the Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng, if Article 1E of the Convention applied to the appellant, he could be removed to Haiti without the benefit of an assessment of the risks in that country. This would open the door to the possibility of Canada indirectly running afoul of its international obligations.7 Since I concluded that the appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution and does not face a risk in Haiti, as he has an IFA, I conclude that removing him to Haiti would not cause Canada to breach its international obligations. This factor weighs in favour of exclusion.  \n",
      "Analysis of the Zeng factors as a whole \n",
      "[29] I conclude that the factors set out in Zeng, considered as a whole, weigh in favour of excluding the appellant from protection under the Convention. The appellant voluntarily failed to look into the possibility of acquiring permanent resident status and left Brazil voluntarily. He failed to establish that he would face a serious possibility of persecution or a personal risk throughout Haiti, on a balance of probabilities. He would have an IFA in Port-au-Prince. Those are the factors that carry the most weight in this analysis.  \n",
      "CONCLUSION \n",
      "[30] For these reasons, I determine that the appellant, XXXX XXXX, is excluded from protection under the Convention.8 Therefore, he is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.  \n",

      "APERÇU\n",
      "[1] L'appelante principale, XXXX XXXX XXXX et XXXX XXXX, appelante associée, sont des citoyennes du Rwanda. Elles interjettent appel de la décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) rendue le 24 décembre 2019 rejetant leur demande d'asile. L'appelante associée base ses allégations sur celles de sa mère.\n",
      "[2] L'appelante principale affirme qu'elle craint pour sa vie advenant un retour au Rwanda. En XXXX 2015, des représentants du pouvoir ont fait pression pour qu'elle signe un registre en faveur d'un référendum qui permettrait une réforme de la constitution, autorisant ainsi le président à se représenter. Après son refus, elle aurait été perçue comme faisant partie de l'opposition au parti au pouvoir. L'appelante indique qu'elle et son mari auraient reçu des menaces au téléphone par la suite. Ces menaces visaient aussi leur famille. On a également fait pression sur eux pour qu'ils cotisent à un fonds de développement établi par le parti FPR. L'appelante signale aussi qu'un de ses fils et sa fille, l'appelante associée, auraient été intimidés parce qu'ils n'avaient pas fait \" l'Ingando \", un genre de service civique et militaire pour les diplômés du secondaire. L'appelante soumet avoir subi, tout au long de l'année 2017, intimidation, humiliation et menaces. Elle craint que des violences sexuelles envers elle et sa fille s'ajoutent à l'ensemble des persécutions que sa famille a subies. La fille de l'appelante a obtenu un visa d'études en XXXX 2017 pour l'université de XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. L'appelante l'a accompagnée au Canada. Elles ont quitté le Rwanda le XXXX XXXX 2017. L'appelante principale affirme avoir appris, le XXXX XXXX 2018, la XXXX de deux de ses fils, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX et XXXX XXXX.  \n",
      "[3] La Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) a jugé que les appelantes n'étaient pas crédibles et n'avaient pas établi leurs allégations. \n",
      "[4] Les appelantes demandent à la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) de renverser la décision attaquée et soumettent que la SPR a erré dans son analyse de la crédibilité des appelantes. Selon elles, la SPR s'est attardée à des faits périphériques. La SPR a aussi erré en ne considérant pas que le fils de l'appelante, XXXX XXXX, a obtenu l'asile sur la base d'allégations identiques à celles de l'appelante. \n",
      "[5] Pour la Section d'appel des réfugiées (SAR), la question déterminante est celle de la crédibilité.  \n",
      "DÉCISION\n",
      "[6] Je rejette l'appel. La SPR a eu raison de conclure que les appelantes n'ont pas qualité de réfugiées au sens de la Convention ni qualité de personnes à protéger. \n",
      "[7] Les contradictions entre le témoignage de l'appelante et son formulaire du Fondement de la demande d'asile (FDA) sont nombreuses et concernent des éléments centraux de sa demande d'asile. Il y a également une omission et des comportements incompatibles avec la crainte alléguée qui sont tout aussi importants. En outre, l'appelante a changé son témoignage à plusieurs reprises lorsque confrontée à ces contradictions et omissions. J'estime que l'appelante n'est généralement pas crédible. \n",
      "NOUVEAUX ÉLÉMENTS DE PREUVE \n",
      "Les éléments de preuve présentés par les appelantes sont admis \n",
      "[8] Les appelantes soumettent deux nouveaux éléments de preuve : un affidavit signé par l'appelante principale et un avis de convocation du Bureau national des enquêtes criminelles.  \n",
      "[9] Conformément à la loi1, je ne peux admettre que des éléments de preuve :\n",
      "i. survenus depuis que la SPR a rendu sa décision; \n",
      "ii. qui n'étaient pas normalement accessibles au moment de la décision;\n",
      "iii. que la personne n'aurait pas normalement présentés à la SPR, dans les circonstances, avant que la décision ne soit rendue.\n",
      "[10] Si les éléments de preuve satisfont à l'une ou plusieurs de ces exigences, je dois décider si les éléments de preuve sont nouveaux, crédibles et pertinents avant de les admettre2.\n",
      "[11] L'affidavit de l'appelante réitère essentiellement les allégations contenues dans son FDA qui sont déjà au dossier. Cependant, l'appelante ajoute qu'elle a appris en février 2020, par une connaissance, que sa \" famille était recherchée en lien avec XXXX de XXXX XXXX des camps de recrutement de l'armée du FPR \".  \n",
      "[12] J'estime que l'affidavit devrait être admis à titre de nouvel élément de preuve parce qu'il satisfait aux autres conditions d'admissibilité pour les nouveaux éléments de preuve énoncées au paragraphe 110(4) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés (LIPR) et dans la jurisprudence applicable. L'affidavit est pertinent et a une valeur probante en ce qui a trait à l'allégation de persécution par le FPR. Les informations révélées à l'appelante en XXXX 2020 n'étaient pas accessibles au moment de la décision de la SPR. L'affidavit satisfait également aux conditions énoncées dans la jurisprudence applicable3. \n",
      "[13] L'avis de convocation du Bureau national des enquêtes est admis. Il est survenu après la décision de la SPR. J'estime qu'il contient des éléments de preuve nouveaux, crédibles et pertinents. \n",
      "[14] Bien que la date à laquelle l'appelante allègue avoir parlé avec sa connaissance et obtenu cet avis semble remarquablement fortuite, je suis prête à dire qu'il n'y a aucun motif de les trouver non crédibles à ce stade-ci. L'affidavit et l'avis de convocation sont admis à titre de nouveaux éléments de preuve.\n",
      "Demande d'audience est rejetée \n",
      "[15] La demande d'audience des appelantes est rejetée, car la nouvelle preuve que j'ai admise ne satisfait pas aux conditions de la tenue d'une audience prévues au paragraphe 110(6) de la LIPR. Plus spécifiquement, l'affidavit et l'avis de convocation n'ont pas une valeur probante suffisante pour que la demande d'asile soit accordée ou refusée. J'expliquerai pourquoi dans mes motifs. \n",
      "ANALYSE\n",
      "[16] Mon rôle consiste à examiner l'ensemble de la preuve et à établir si la décision de la SPR est correcte4.  \n",
      "[17] Dans mon analyse, j'ai pris en considération les Directives numéro 4 du président de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié portant sur les Revendicatrices du statut de réfugié craignant d'être persécutées en raison de leur sexe.\n",
      "L'appelante n'est pas un témoin crédible\n",
      "[18] Dans son FDA, l'appelante indique que deux de ses fils, XXXX XXXX XXXX et XXXX, ont été XXXX par les autorités rwandaises le XXXX XXXX 2017, les deux autres, XXXX et XXXX, sont traumatisés par cet événement. Son mari lui aurait appris la nouvelle le XXXX XXXX 2018. Or durant l'audience du XXXX XXXX 2019, l'appelante affirme que ses quatre fils ont été XXXX. XXXX aurait réussi à XXXX après quelques jours et a rejoint Kigali, où il s'est réfugié chez sa cousine. Il serait demeuré caché jusqu'à ce qu'il trouve le moyen de se rendre au Canada le XXXX XXXX 2018. Les trois autres frères seraient toujours XXXX. À la date de l'audience des appelantes, XXXX avait déjà été accepté comme réfugié par la SPR. \n",
      "[19] La SPR a rejeté l'explication de l'appelante selon laquelle elle avait appris la vérité au sujet de la disparition de ses quatre fils par l'entremise de XXXX lors de son arrivée au Canada. La SPR note que l'appelante a confirmé sous serment qu'elle avait relu son FDA la veille et qu'il était complet et exact. Par ailleurs, l'appelante a présenté un FDA amendé dix jours avant l'audience, le XXXX XXXX 2019, qui n'apportait aucune modification au premier récit quant à la disparition de deux de ses fils. \n",
      "[20] Dans son mémoire, l'appelante soutient que lors de sa demande d'asile, son fils XXXX a fourni tous les détails concernant le XXXX dont il aurait été victime avec ses frères. Elle croyait que cette information était connue du tribunal. De plus, elle a déposé deux pièces le jour même de l'audience : un avis de décision positive pour XXXX et un courriel de son mari indiquant que deux de ses fils sont toujours XXXX.\n",
      "[21] Je n'accepte pas les arguments de l'appelante.  \n",
      "[22] Les avis de décision ne contiennent aucune allégation ni aucun élément de preuve. Ils ne font qu'établir qu'une personne a obtenu la protection du Canada. Si tant est que le FDA de XXXX ait contenu de nouvelles allégations concernant les événements du XXXX XXXX 2017, l'appelante avait l'obligation de le fournir à la SPR pour établir ses allégations. Or, elle a omis de le faire. On ne peut reprocher à la SPR de ne pas avoir considéré une preuve qui n'a pas été présentée. Je note qu'en appel, l'appelante n'a pas déposé le FDA de XXXX qui confirme prétendument que tous ses fils auraient été XXXX. \n",
      "[23] Je suis d'accord avec les conclusions de la SPR quant au FDA amendé déposé le XXXX XXXX 2019, soit dix jours avant l'audience, et qui ne fait pas mention des faits nouveaux que lui aurait révélés XXXX. La SAR ne s'explique pas que l'appelante déclare en début d'audience que tout ce qui se trouve dans son FDA est véridique, alors que XXXX n'est pas XXXX, contrairement à ce qui est allégué dans le FDA, et qu'il lui aurait rapporté des faits différents dès XXXX 2018.  \n",
      "[24] En outre, je note les contradictions et incohérences suivantes : \n",
      "- L'appelante aurait été avisée par son mari le XXXX XXXX 2018 que XXXX XXXX XXXX et XXXX, deux de ses fils, avaient XXXX, les deux autres fils, XXXX et XXXX, seraient à la maison \" traumatisés \" par le rapt de leurs frères. Or, selon le témoignage de l'appelante lors de l'audience, XXXX s'est XXXX quelques jours après le XXXX XXXX 2017 et s'est caché chez sa cousine à Kigali, les trois autres fils étant toujours XXXX. La cousine en question aurait avisé le mari de l'appelante que XXXX se cachait chez elle. Le mari de l'appelante savait donc peu de temps après le XXXX XXXX 2017 que XXXX était XXXX. \n",
      "- Le courriel de son mari, que l'appelante a déposé le jour de l'audience et qu'elle aurait reçu la veille, mentionne encore la même allégation selon laquelle deux fils sont XXXX, alors que l'appelante déclare dans son témoignage que trois de ses fils sont toujours XXXX et que XXXX est au Canada.\n",
      "[25] Je tire une inférence négative quant à la crédibilité de l'appelante pour avoir omis de soumettre le FDA de son fils XXXX, une déclaration de sa part ou de le faire témoigner à l'audience. Je tire une inférence négative quant à la crédibilité de l'appelante du fait qu'elle ait affirmé sous serment au début de l'audience que son FDA, révisé la veille, était complet, exact et vrai. Je n'accorde aucun poids au courriel du mari de l'appelante, soumis le jour de l'audience, qui contredit le témoignage de cette dernière. Je conclus que les fils de l'appelante n'ont pas été XXXX par les autorités rwandaises. J'estime que l'appelante n'est pas un témoin crédible. L'accumulation d'incohérences et de contradictions me fait conclure que l'appelante n'est généralement pas crédible. \n",
      "Retours au pays\n",
      "[26] Les appelantes ont indiqué dans leur FDA que les menaces et le harcèlement de tous les membres de la famille étaient incessants en 2017. L'appelante témoigne que ni elle ni son mari ne pouvait travailler. Lors des derniers mois avant le départ vers le Canada, les appelantes allèguent qu'elles ne sortaient pas de la maison. \n",
      "[27] La SPR note que les appelantes ont voyagé à l'étranger en XXXX et en XXXX 2017 respectivement, mais n'ont pas inscrit ces voyages dans leur FDA. \n",
      "[28] En outre, la SPR tire une inférence négative du comportement de l'appelante principale qui est retournée au Rwanda en XXXX 2017 alors qu'elle craignait pour sa vie. En outre, La SPR estime que les appelantes, qui ont voyagé à l'étranger, ne vivaient pas cachées contrairement à ce qu'elles ont allégué. \n",
      "[29] On plaide dans le mémoire que l'appelante associée, XXXX, est allée en République Démocratique du Congo en XXXX 2017 avant d'être personnellement menacée par les autorités scolaires en XXXX 2017. S'agissant de l'appelante principale, on ajoute qu'elle est allée en Ouganda pour se faire soigner. \n",
      "[30] Ces arguments ne me satisfont pas. D'une part, les menaces contre la famille des appelantes qui était prétendument considérée comme des opposants au régime débutent dès XXXX 2015 et visent les deux appelantes. L'appelante associée était menacée avant XXXX 2017. D'autre part, la SPR ne reproche pas à l'appelante principale d'avoir quitté le pays pour des raisons médicales. Mais une fois qu'elle a échappé à ses persécuteurs, la SPR ne comprend pas qu'elle soit retournée au pays. Lors de son témoignage, l'appelante explique qu'elle est revenue pour s'occuper de ses enfants. Or ces derniers étaient tous adultes. La famille étant en danger de mort, il est raisonnable de conclure qu'il eut été préférable de faire sortir ceux qui étaient encore au Rwanda plutôt que d'y retourner. Les arguments des appelantes ne répondent pas aux conclusions de la SPR. \n",
      "[31] À mon avis, dans le contexte de persécution continu allégué qui aurait débuté en XXXX 2015, mais qui se serait intensifié en 2017, les retours au Rwanda des appelantes sont des comportements incompatibles avec la crainte alléguée. Je suis d'accord avec la SPR, qui n'a pas erré. \n",
      "Je n'accorde pas de poids à l'avis de convocation\n",
      "[32] L'appelante dépose comme nouvelle preuve un avis de convocation daté du XXXX XXXX 2019 provenant du Bureau national des enquêtes criminelles ainsi qu'un affidavit. Dans son affidavit, l'appelante indique qu'une connaissance (\" Monsieur XXXX \"), membre du FPR, lui a dit que sa famille est recherchée en lien avec XXXX de XXXX des camps de recrutement de l'armée du FPR. Selon le témoignage de l'appelante, son mari s'était enfui en Ouganda un ou deux mois avant l'audience de la SPR qui s'est tenue le XXXX XXXX 2019. L'avis de convocation aurait été laissé à un domestique au domicile de l'appelante, car son mari n'était plus au pays. Une cousine qui a voyagé au Rwanda aurait remis l'avis à l'appelante en XXXX 2020. \n",
      "[33] Je ne donne pas de poids à l'avis de convocation pour les motifs suivants :\n",
      "[34] Comme je l'ai mentionné précédemment, l'arrivée fortuite d'un avis de convocation lié à XXXX de XXXX juste après la décision négative de la SPR est surprenante. \n",
      "[35] Il n'est pas établi que l'avis de convocation, à sa face même, soit en lien avec XXXX de XXXX en XXXX 2017. Selon ce même monsieur XXXX, il était urgent que toute la famille quitte le Rwanda en XXXX 2017 et l'appelante a témoigné que leurs vies étaient en danger à cette époque, car quelque chose de sinistre se préparait. Même si j'acceptais que la convocation portât sur ce sujet, je note que XXXX se serait XXXX quelques jours après le XXXX XXXX 2017. Or, la famille n'a jamais été convoquée à ce sujet alors que l'événement venait de se produire. De surcroît, les appelantes ne font état d'aucun suivi des autorités après que l'appelante ait omis de se présenter à la convocation (l'avis date de XXXX 2019 et la cousine de l'appelante l'aurait récupéré en XXXX 2020). \n",
      "[36] De plus, les autorités auraient XXXX les quatre fils sans aucune forme de procès. Un avis de convocation relié à la disparition d'un des quatre fils, par son caractère légal et formel, contraste fortement avec les méthodes brutales du parti au pouvoir alléguées par l'appelante. Dans un tel contexte, un avis qui ne précise pas le motif de la convocation ne semble pas correspondre aux allégations de l'appelante. \n",
      "[37] En outre, les autorités ont été informées en XXXX 20175, par le mari de l'appelante, que l'appelante avait accompagné sa fille à l'étranger pour ses études. D'après la preuve au dossier, le mari de l'appelante n'a jamais été convoqué par les autorités, alors qu'il est prétendument resté au Rwanda jusqu'en XXXX ou XXXX 2019.  \n",
      "[38] L'élément le plus important est l'absence générale de crédibilité de l'appelante. Ayant conclu que ses fils n'ont pas été XXXX par les autorités rwandaises, j'estime que cet avis de convocation dont le contenu est vague n'est pas suffisant pour établir l'allégation de l'appelante principale. Suivant l'arrêt Chinwuba6 : \" Les éléments de preuve ne sont pas évalués indépendamment de la demande d'asile dans son ensemble, et si la preuve personnelle du demandeur n'est pas crédible, il est raisonnable que la SAR ait des doutes sur la crédibilité de la preuve documentaire présentée à l'appui de la demande. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION \n",
      "[39] L'appelante principale n'était généralement pas crédible, son récit contenait de nombreuses contradictions et incohérences. Elle n'a pas établi ses allégations. Elle a omis de présenter des preuves sans fournir d'explications raisonnables pour l'expliquer. L'appelante associée base sa demande d'asile sur les allégations de sa mère qui n'ont pas été établies. \n",
      "[40] Je rejette l'appel et confirme la décision attaquée selon laquelle les appelantes n'ont pas qualité de réfugiées au sens de la Convention ni qualité de personnes à protéger.\n",

      "Reasons for decision\n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX (the appellant) argues that the Refugee Protection Division (the RPD) erred when it denied his claim for refugee protection. \n",
      "[2] He alleges he cannot return to China, where he will be persecuted by the authorities because he is Catholic. \n",
      "Determination \n",
      "[3] I confirm the decision of the RPD that the appellant is not a Convention refugee. Nor is he a person in need of protection. \n",
      "[4] The determinative issue is credibility. \n",
      "Allegations \n",
      "[5] In XXXX 2017, the appellant started to practice Christianity. In XXXX 2017, he attended an underground house church. In XXXX 2017, the Public Security Bureau (PSB) detained him and two others for their religious activities. They were released after one week and the payment of a fine. He stopped attending his underground church.  \n",
      "[6] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, the appellant was called to the PSB office, where he was questioned about proselytizing leaflets found in the area. \n",
      "[7] The appellant left China with the assistance of a smuggler. Since his arrival in Canada, the appellant has attended a Catholic church. In XXXX 2018 and XXXX 2019, the PSB visited his house in China. \n",
      "Role of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD)\n",
      "[8] I am required to examine the record independently and determine if the RPD arrived at the correct decision.1  I must  consider the admissibility of the new evidence and decide on whether to convene an oral hearing if I admit the new evidence. \n",
      "No new evidence; no oral hearing \n",
      "[9] The appellant is not submitting any new evidence. Therefore, I do not have the jurisdiction to convene an oral hearing. \n",
      "The RPD was correct to find the appellant lacked religious knowledge \n",
      "[10] The appellant argues the RPD erred by finding that he lacked religious knowledge. The appellant concedes that he has a low level of knowledge, but this is because he is not a sophisticated or educated person. The RPD is entitled to ask questions into the sincerity of his beliefs but must be careful because beliefs are subjective and personal. \n",
      "[11] I agree with the appellant that sincerity is an important aspect of faith. An individual's knowledge may or may not be indicative of genuine faith. The appellant points out that any inquiry into religious beliefs must be approached with extreme caution as beliefs are subjective and personal in nature. \n",
      "[12] With these words in mind, I find that the appellant lacks religious knowledge and that his lack of knowledge does impact the sincerity of belief. After an independent review of the record, I arrive at the same conclusion as the RPD. \n",
      "[13] At the time of the hearing (XXXX 2019), the appellant had been a Catholic for two years as he first started to pray in XXXX 2017. Since XXXX 2018, he has been in Canada, which means that it is easier for him to access religious materials and that he can practice without fear of repercussions. \n",
      "[14] The RPD made a negative inference with respect to the appellant's statement that he only read a little of the Bible. The appellant explained that he thought he had hurt his head and could not remember what he had read. The appellant did not provide any evidence of an injury other than his statement. He stated that the Bible consisted of the Old Testament and the New Testament. The New Testament was about Jesus. The RPD asked who wrote about Jesus and the appellant replied that he forgot everything because of his nervousness. \n",
      "[15] The RPD took its cues from the appellant's answers. The appellant said that the New Testament was about Jesus. The RPD then asked a logical follow-up question: who wrote about Jesus? The appellant was unable to answer. \n",
      "[16] The RPD asked the appellant if he remembered anything else from the Bible. The appellant replied that he recited the Rosary from the Bible. The Rosary is not in the Bible. It is a collection of Catholic prayers, which is recited in conjunction with a string and knots/beads. \n",
      "[17] The RPD asked the appellant to name other central figures in Christianity. This is a broad question for which the appellant can give a variety of answers. The appellant replied the twelve disciples. The RPD asked the appellant for some of their names, whereupon he replied that he could not recite all their names. He named Jacob and Jacob 2 (two), who are not disciples. Again, the RPD is responding to appellant's testimony when it asks its next question. \n",
      "[18] The RPD did not have a specific answer it wanted the appellant to give. It did not find that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was more central than the twelve disciples. The RPD also found that the appellant had difficulty in reciting the prayer \"Our Father\". \n",
      "[19] I agree with the RPD that this lack of knowledge is not credible. The appellant has been attending mass at least once a week in Canada and a religious class for adults. He ought to have been able to articulate some aspects of Christianity, aspects that he himself identified as important. \n",
      "[20] I agree with the RPD that the appellant's lack of knowledge is indicative of a lack of sincerity. The RPD did not ask academic or technical questions, but rather questions that could be answered based upon the appellant's personal experience and/or knowledge. \n",
      "The RPD was correct to disbelieve other aspects of the appellant's story \n",
      "[21] The appellant argues that the RPD was incorrect to doubt the authenticity, the confirmation of release, the administrative punishment decision, and the fine receipt. He further argues that the RPD impugned these documents because the RPD did not find him credible and quotes the Federal Court in Sterling: I do not believe you, therefore I do not believe anything that explains why I might be wrong.2 \n",
      "[22] I disagree with the appellant as follows.  \n",
      "\tThe PSB confirmation of release \n",
      "[23] The appellant argues that the RPD was incorrect to impugn the confirmation of release because there are no conditions that govern the release of the appellant. The RPD did not have a sample to compare it to, nor did it rely on specialized knowledge. \n",
      "[24] I agree with the appellant in as far as the RPD was incorrect to impugn the confirmation of release because it lacks conditions, though the appellant did not testify that the police put him on conditions. \n",
      "[25] I do find, however, that the RPD was correct to impugn the authenticity of the document based on its reference to Article 65 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which allows for bail pending trial. The appellant argues that item 2.9 contains a slightly different translation of Article 65, without bail pending trial. \n",
      "[26] The NDP item that the appellant references his submissions both at the RPD and the RAD does not contain a translation of Article 65. It is a report by the Austrian Red Cross dated March 2014, which covers a broad range of topics such as women, children, law enforcement, religion etc. While there are translations of some articles of various laws, there is no translation of article 65 of the Criminal Procedure Law. I will use the translation that the appellant has provided in his arguments. \n",
      "[27] Item 9.7 uses the words \"bail pending trial\" while the appellant's translation uses the word \"bail.\" This is not a significant difference. The word bail means the release of an accused person pending trial. Its other meanings are to do with fishing, climbing, sports etc. \n",
      "[28] The RPD was correct to find that this difference in translation is not significant and correct to make a negative inference with respect to the confirmation of release. \n",
      "\tThe administrative punishment decision \n",
      "[29] The RPD impugned this document because it did not state the specific provision of the law in the appellant's case. The appellant argues that the RPD was wrong to make this decision as it did not have a sample for comparison and/or did not rely on specialized knowledge. \n",
      "[30] The NDP has no sample administrative punishment decisions. \n",
      "[31] The RPD was incorrect to make the decision it did for the reasons it articulated. \n",
      "\tThe fine receipt\n",
      "[32] The RPD rejected the fine receipt because it lacked security features. \n",
      "[33] The appellant is correct. This is not a reasonable finding because the RPD does not know if security features are integral to fine receipts. It is possible that some or many official documents in China lack security features.  \n",
      "\tMy independent analysis of the appellant's documents \n",
      "[34] I have already rejected the appellant's confirmation of release for reasons explained above. \n",
      "[35] I have carefully examined the appellant's fine receipt and administrative punishment decision and have found no discrepancies on the face of the documents, such as errors, incorrect dates etc. \n",
      "[36] I do not find the appellant's documents to be genuine. I am aware that I am not supposed to engage in circular reasoning.3 These documents are important corroborative evidence for the appellant. \n",
      "[37] In the matter at hand, there is sufficient evidence for me to doubt the authenticity of the fine receipt and the administrative punishment decision on a balance of probabilities. \n",
      "[38] Credibility is a necessary and complex aspect of refugee adjudication. It is made up of many different factors, some independent, some determinative, some impacted by other findings, each with its own weight.\n",
      "[39] I cannot view the fine receipt and the administrative punishment decision in isolation. That would neither be fair nor appropriate. The evidence of the documents is impacted by the remainder of the appellant's evidence. Even if I accept that the documents are genuine, they do not rehabilitate his lack of religious knowledge, which cannot be attributed to his lack of education and alleged nervousness. I note the appellant stated he was nervous only when he was asked religious knowledge questions. He did not express nervousness at any other time. \n",
      "[40] The documents are the consequence of the appellant's religious practice. His knowledge was tested at the hearing by the RPD member and counsel, but he was unable to explain concepts that he himself raised. The RPD found that he lacked knowledge. I agree. \n",
      "[41] The reliability of the appellant's documents is eroded by his lack of knowledge and his lack of credibility. In other words, the appellant's version of events is no longer internally consistent. \n",
      "[42] Liu provides a non-exhaustive list of factors that can be used to assess the genuineness of documents. One factor is \"doubts on the credibility or trustworthiness that says the same thing as the document whose genuineness is in question (e.g. the testimony of a party).\" This applies here. I doubt the appellant's testimony regarding the cause of the issuance of his documents (his Catholicism). \n",
      "[43] There is sufficient evidence for me to find that the summons is not genuine. It was not issued because of the appellant's religious activities, because the appellant lacks basic religious knowledge. \n",
      "[44] The purpose of a fraudulent document is to look like the genuine article. It aims to have no errors or discrepancies. It would be counterproductive for a document forger to produce documents that do not pass inspection or contradict the appellant's account of events. \n",
      "[45] I note that fraudulent documents are widespread in China4. \n",
      "Summary \n",
      "[46] I do not find that the appellant was detained and interrogated in China because of his religious beliefs. His religious knowledge is inadequate and his documents, which are a consequence of his religious practice, do not rehabilitate his credibility. \n",
      "[47] The appellant has been attending church in Canada. The letter from his church states that he intends to be baptized XXXX 2020. XXXX 2020 has come and passed. I have no information if the appellant continues to attend church after rejection by the RPD and/or if he has been baptized. \n",
      "[48] I accept that the appellant attended church in Canada at the time of his RPD hearing. There is no evidence that his religious activities in Canada have come to the attention of the Chinese authorities. His attendance at the church in Canada, a continuation of his alleged religious practice in China, does not mean he is a genuine Catholic. '\n",
      "[49] Should he return to China, I find he would not continue to practice as his practice in Canada is not for reasons of genuine faith. \n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "[50] I have conducted an independent review of the record, hearing and RPD decision. There is no error. I agree with the RPD that the appellant is not credible. \n",
      "[51] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n",

      "[1] Je fais droit au présent appel. XXXX XXXX (l'appelant principal) et XXXX XXXX XXXX (l'appelante associée) sont des citoyens du Nigéria. Ils ont interjeté appel d'une décision rejetant leur demande d'asile. Ils font valoir qu'ils risquent d'être persécutés par la famille de l'appelant principal. La Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) a rejeté leur demande d'asile. Après avoir examiné le dossier, j'ai fait droit à l'appel. Je substitue à la décision attaquée ma propre décision selon laquelle les appelants ont qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention.\n",
      "CONTEXTE\n",
      "[2] L'appelant principal et son épouse, l'appelante associée, fondent leurs demandes d'asile sur ce qui suit. \n",
      "[3] Les appelants étaient XXXX XXXX XXXX à Lagos. L'appelante associée a fait une fausse couche. Au printemps 2017, la famille de l'appelant principal a commencé à exercer des pressions sur eux pour qu'ils aient recours à de l'aide spirituelle. Les appelants se sont rendus dans un village et ont consulté un spirite. Ils n'ont pas su quelle était sa recommandation avant leur retour à Lagos. Après cela, l'oncle les a informés que le spirite recommandait à l'appelante de subir la mutilation génitale des femmes (MGF). Il a commencé à exercer sur eux des pressions pour qu'ils le fassent; il s'agit d'une tradition familiale. L'oncle a commencé à leur rendre visite avec des proches pour exercer sur eux des pressions. La police n'a été d'aucune utilité. L'appelante associée a perdu un autre enfant à cause du harcèlement. En septembre 2017, l'appelante associée a dû s'enfuir par la porte arrière lorsque des proches sont venus lui rendre visite. Ils ont agressé l'appelant principal, mais les voisins sont intervenus, et l'agression a cessé. L'appelante associée est allée à Benin City, où sa famille se trouvait, pour y rester. Sa famille était divisée sur la question. Les appelants ont fui au Canada et ont présenté une demande d'asile. Le XXXX XXXX 2019, les appelants ont eu une petite fille. Elle fait de XXXX XXXXdepuis sa naissance et a une XXXX XXXX.\n",
      "Observations présentées après l'audience; nouveaux éléments de preuve et éléments de preuve tardifs\n",
      "[4] Au départ, les appelants n'avaient pas fourni de nouveaux éléments de preuve. Cependant, dans un avis daté du 27 octobre 2020, la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) a donné aux appelants l'occasion de présenter de nouvelles observations concernant la crédibilité, le bien-fondé de leur crainte et le cartable national de documentation (CND) en vigueur au moment de la rédaction de la décision1.\n",
      "[5] Les appelants n'ont pas présenté de nouvelles observations sur les questions susmentionnées. Ils ont fait valoir que l'avis était déficient. Ils ont déclaré que la crédibilité était maintenant la principale question à trancher. Cet argument est spécieux. La crédibilité a toujours été au premier plan; la SPR a écrit clairement que les demandes d'asile ne pouvaient pas être accueillies pour des motifs liés à la crédibilité2. De plus, la SAR peut présenter des conclusions additionnelles quant à la crédibilité3. La SAR avait donné aux appelants l'occasion de fournir des observations en se fondant sur le CND pour appuyer leurs allégations; au lieu de cela, ils se sont abstenus et se sont appuyés sur leurs observations de février 2020. Ces observations ne sont pas utiles.\n",
      "[6] De plus, même si les appelants n'ont pas fourni de nouveaux éléments de preuve avec le dossier d'appel, ils ont fourni avec leur réponse à l'avis de la SAR un affidavit du frère de l'appelante associée, qui déclarait que la famille de l'appelant principal avait rendu visite à l'appelante associée et l'avait menacée. Cependant, les appelants n'ont pas fourni d'observations conformément à la règle 29 relative à l'admission d'éléments de preuve tardifs. Il est à noter que le communiqué de la SAR relatif à la COVID4 indique que les appelants doivent présenter des observations conformément à la règle 29. Les appelants doivent également montrer que les éléments de preuve satisfont aux exigences énoncées au paragraphe 110(4) et aux principes énoncés dans la décision Raza, tels qu'ils ont été modifiés dans l'arrêt Singh5. Les appelants soulignent que les éléments de preuve sont postérieurs à l'audience et qu'ils montrent que les agents de persécution les pourchassent toujours et [traduction] \" que les difficultés des appelants au Nigéria sont toujours d'actualité \". Le sens de cette dernière phrase n'est pas clair. L'affidavit est postérieur à l'audience, mais, ce qui est pertinent pour les besoins de la règle 29, c'est qu'il est postérieur à la date de mise en état de l'appel, tout comme l'incident qu'il décrit. La pertinence et la valeur probante concernent le comportement des agents de persécution. Le contenu apporte un nouvel élément de preuve. Ces considérations se rapportent en effet à la règle 29, au paragraphe 110(4) et à certains des principes énoncés dans la décision Raza. Toutefois, les observations et les éléments de preuve sont insuffisants pour conclure que les éléments de preuve proviennent d'une source crédible. Les appelants n'expliquent pas comment ils ont reçu ce document. Ceci s'inscrit dans un contexte où, selon les éléments de preuve documentaire, les affidavits frauduleux sont facilement accessibles6. Même les fonctionnaires de la Cour s'en procurent ouvertement7. Il n'y a pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve à l'appui pour conclure que la source et les circonstances de cet affidavit sont crédibles. Comme l'affidavit ne respecte pas la norme de la crédibilité établie dans les principes énoncés dans la décision Raza, il n'est pas admis au dossier.\n",
      "AUDIENCE\n",
      "[7] Les appelants n'avaient pas demandé d'audience au départ; toutefois, en réponse à la demande de présentation d'observations, ils l'ont fait. Comme il n'y a pas de nouveaux éléments de preuve, je n'ai pas compétence pour tenir une audience8.\n",
      "ANALYSE\n",
      "[8] En l'espèce, la question déterminante est de savoir s'il existe une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI). J'ai examiné l'ensemble du dossier et écouté l'enregistrement de l'audience. Une copie de cet enregistrement se trouve dans le dossier.\n",
      "Conclusions de la Section de la protection des réfugiés et déférence\n",
      "[9] En l'espèce, il n'y a pas lieu de faire preuve de déférence à l'égard des conclusions de la SPR en matière de crédibilité. Les conclusions de la SPR en matière de crédibilité sont centrées sur le fait que les appelants n'ont pas présenté de demande d'asile aux États-Unis. Je constate que les appelants sont arrivés aux États-Unis le XXXX XXXX 2017 et en sont repartis le XXXX XXXX 20179. Compte tenu de la nature limitée des conclusions de la SPR, je ne pense pas qu'il faut faire preuve de déférence à son égard. Elle n'a pas fait de conclusions fondées sur le comportement ou sur tout autre aspect où elle avait un avantage important sur la SAR.\n",
      "Les appelants disposent-ils d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur à Abuja?\n",
      "[10] Le critère d'évaluation de la PRI comporte deux volets, et il est énoncé dans l'arrêt Rasaratnam de la Cour d'appel fédérale10 :\n",
      "1) La Commission doit être convaincue selon la prépondérance des probabilités que le demandeur d'asile ne risque pas sérieusement d'être persécuté dans la partie du pays où, selon elle, il existe une possibilité de refuge intérieur et/ou que le demandeur d'asile ne serait pas personnellement exposé à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels ou inusités ou au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'y être soumis à la torture.\n",
      "2) De plus, la situation dans cette partie du pays censée offrir une possibilité de refuge intérieur doit être telle qu'il ne serait pas déraisonnable, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, y compris celles propres à la demande d'asile, que le demandeur s'y réfugie11.\n",
      "[11] Chacun des volets doit être établi pour qu'il soit possible de conclure à l'existence d'une PRI. Une fois que la question de la PRI a été soulevée et que les endroits pouvant offrir une PRI ont été répertoriés, c'est à l'appelant qu'incombe le fardeau de prouver qu'il ne dispose pas d'une PRI. Il faut fonder la conclusion relative à une PRI sur une évaluation distincte de la région proposée à cette fin en tenant compte des circonstances personnelles de l'appelant. Une PRI doit être une option réaliste et abordable. Il ne faut pas exiger de l'appelant qu'il s'expose à un grand danger physique ou qu'il subisse des épreuves indues pour se rendre dans cette autre partie de son pays ou pour y demeurer. \n",
      "Existe-t-il une possibilité sérieuse de persécution à Abuja?\n",
      "\tPressions exercées par la famille en ce qui concerne la mutilation génitale des femmes\n",
      "[12] Les éléments de preuve relatifs aux pressions familiales en ce qui concerne la MGF sont crédibles. J'estime que le récit des appelants concernant la consultation du spirite est crédible et que l'appelante associée a subi des pressions importantes pour qu'elle subisse la MGF. Les appelants ont déclaré qu'ils ont consulté le spirite, mais n'ont été informés de la MGF suggérée que plus tard. Il s'agit d'un détail précis qui renforce la crédibilité. Malgré qu'il puisse y avoir une certaine exagération dans leur exposé circonstancié, le récit de la visite au spirite inclut des détails qui renforcent le compte rendu général des pressions exercées par la famille pour que l'appelante associée subisse la MGF. De même, le récit de la fausse couche renforce également la crédibilité des appelants. La fausse couche sert de base à la conviction de la famille qu'il y avait un problème auquel il fallait remédier. Pour ces motifs, je conclus qu'il est plus probable que le contraire que le récit des pressions exercées par la famille pour que l'appelante associée subisse la MGF soit crédible.\n",
      "Famille à Abuja\n",
      "[13] De plus, il y a suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour conclure que des membres de la famille de l'appelant principal, les agents de persécution, sont présents à Abuja. L'appelant principal a déclaré que des membres de sa famille vivaient dans de grandes villes, mais n'a pas mentionné Abuja12. Il a déclaré que [traduction] \" pour autant que je sache, j'ai des oncles et des tantes dans tout le pays. Donc, l'information pourrait atteindre n'importe lequel d'entre eux facilement si je déménage dans l'une de ces villes13. \" \n",
      "[14] Il existe des éléments de preuve plus précis indiquant que l'appelant principal a de la famille à Abuja. Dans son formulaire Fondement de la demande d'asile (formulaire FDA), l'appelant principal a déclaré qu'il avait un frère à Abuja14. Il a également déclaré qu'il avait séjourné chez son oncle, le frère de son père, à Abuja15. Il ne s'agit pas de l'oncle qui demande la MGF; cependant, les deux oncles sont des frères du père de l'appelant principal. Étant donné que c'est la famille du père qui a fait pression sur les appelants en faveur de la MGF, la présence de membres de la famille à Abuja entraîne la probabilité que ceux-ci retrouvent les appelants. De plus, dans ce cas, étant donné qu'ils auraient leur fille avec eux, il est probable que les agents de persécution seraient plus motivés encore à les retrouver. J'ai pris en compte ce point dans le contexte du témoignage de l'appelant principal selon lequel la tribu Isoko est grande16. En outre, les agents de persécution ont démontré leur capacité à retrouver les appelants dans d'autres villes, puisqu'ils les ont retrouvés à Lagos. La présence de membres de la famille à Abuja augmente la probabilité de persécution dans cette ville.\n",
      "[15] Les arguments des appelants sur la manière dont les agents de persécution pourraient les retrouver ne sont pas tous convaincants. Les arguments concernant l'enregistrement des téléphones portables, les médias sociaux et l'enregistrement bancaire ne sont pas convaincants. Cependant, je reconnais que la tribu Isoko est importante et que l'appelant principal a de la famille à Abuja. Cela est suffisant pour conclure à la possibilité que les appelants soient retrouvés.\n",
      "\tÉléments de preuve documentaire objectifs\n",
      "[16] Les éléments de preuve documentaire objectifs concernant la possibilité pour les parents de refuser la MGF sont contradictoires. Cependant, les sources semblent s'accorder sur le fait que cela pourrait [traduction] \" inclure l'ostracisme, la stigmatisation et le chantage, la privation des avantages intraculturels et la violence physique17 \" et que ces éléments de preuve indiquent que les filles et les femmes pourraient être incapables de se marier et être considérées comme sales et dévergondées18. Je constate que l'appelante associée correspond au profil d'une femme qui serait soumise à la MGF. Cette pratique est moins répandue chez les femmes qui n'ont aucune instruction19. Elle semble plus fréquente chez les femmes riches et instruites des zones urbaines20. Les appelants sont instruits, appartiennent à la classe moyenne et vivent en milieu urbain. L'appelant principal est titulaire de diplômes d'études postsecondaires21; l'appelante associée a commencé des études universitaires22. En outre, ils vivaient dans la partie sud du Nigéria. Le dossier contient des éléments de preuve documentaire qui indiquent que la MGF est plus largement pratiquée dans le sud du pays, où la fréquence est de 65 à 77 p. 100. J'estime que les éléments de preuve documentaire objectifs montrent que l'appelante associée correspond au profil des femmes susceptibles d'être forcées de subir la MGF. Ces éléments de preuve appuient la possibilité qu'elle soit forcée de subir la MGF.\n",
      "\tRésumé de la question de savoir s'il existe une possibilité sérieuse de persécution à Abuja\n",
      "[17] Certains problèmes de crédibilité nuisent à la crédibilité de la demande d'asile. Par exemple, l'affidavit du voisin comporte deux adresses différentes23. Cela ne renforce pas la demande d'asile. Cependant, de façon générale, il y a suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles pour conclure qu'il est plus probable que le contraire que l'appelante associée fasse l'objet de pressions pour qu'elle subisse la MGF. En outre, même si les éléments de preuve documentaire sont contradictoires, il y a, en l'espèce et dans ces circonstances particulières, suffisamment d'éléments de preuve documentaire pour conclure qu'il existe une possibilité sérieuse de préjudice grave à Abuja. J'admets que les appelants ont subi des menaces continues. En d'autres termes, le poids de la preuve crédible sur les questions centrales appuie les demandes d'asile des appelants. Même si certains des éléments de preuve concernant les agressions passées24 et la fuite par la porte arrière ne sont pas aussi crédibles, j'accepte que les appelants se soient sentis tellement menacés par les pressions exercées par la famille que l'appelante associée s'est rendue à Benin City pour se cacher de la famille. Aucun élément de preuve d'une persécution passée n'est nécessaire pour conclure à un risque de persécution futur. Et, comme les appelants ont maintenant une fille, ce risque est accru. Pour ces motifs, et dans ces circonstances, je conclus qu'il existe une possibilité sérieuse de persécution à Abuja.\n",
      "\tProtection de l'État\n",
      "[18] Le témoignage sur l'implication de la police n'est pas clair. Par exemple, le témoignage concernant le rapport de police est vague25. Cependant, les éléments de preuve permettent de conclure qu'il est peu probable que la police n'aide pas les appelants, même à Abuja. La loi de 2015 interdisant la violence contre les personnes au Nigéria (Nigerian Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act) criminalise les pratiques traditionnelles préjudiciables, dont la MGF, et cette loi est appliquée à Abuja. Toutefois, en juin 2018, aucune poursuite n'avait été intentée au titre de la loi interdisant la violence contre les personnes au Nigéria26. Même s'il existe dans de nombreux États des lois interdisant la MGF, la pratique reste répandue, et les signalements et les poursuites sont peu nombreux27. J'estime que les appelants n'auraient pas accès à la protection de l'État à Abuja.\n",
      "Est-il raisonnable pour les appelants de se réinstaller à Abuja?\n",
      "[19] Je me suis demandé si les appelants subiraient un préjudice indu s'ils se réinstallaient et demeuraient à Abuja. Pour chaque demande d'asile, différents facteurs revêtent différents niveaux de pertinence. Cela dépend de leurs caractéristiques. \n",
      "[20] Les appelants ont fait des études et ont exploité un hôtel à Lagos. Ils font partie de la population des Isokos, qui n'est pas un groupe ethnique important28; cependant j'accepte le témoignage selon lequel il s'agit d'une grande tribu. \n",
      "[21] Certaines considérations ne présentent pas d'obstacles. L'identité autochtone est un problème, au Nigéria; cependant, Abuja est une ville diversifiée, et il n'y a pas de discrimination pour l'accès aux services publics29. Les appelants parlent anglais; la langue n'est donc pas un obstacle. Tous deux sont chrétiens, et le christianisme est une religion importante au Nigéria; cela ne constituerait pas un obstacle à la réinstallation.\n",
      "\tEmploi\n",
      "[22] Je conclus qu'il serait très difficile pour les appelants de trouver du travail à Abuja. Des éléments de preuve montrent qu'il est possible d'obtenir un poste dans la fonction publique30, mais aussi qu'il peut y avoir une discrimination pour les emplois au gouvernement31, auxquels des quotas sont associés32. Le marché du travail à Abuja est compétitif33. L'appelant principal a déclaré qu'il ne pouvait pas créer une entreprise à Abuja, car il n'avait pas les moyens financiers34. En outre, il n'y a pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve montrant que les appelants ont les relations nécessaires pour trouver du travail. Même si l'appelant principal a un frère à Abuja et qu'il a vécu avec le frère cadet de son père à Abuja35, il s'agit de personnes qui sont liées aux agents de persécution. Il n'est pas raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que les appelants comptent sur leur soutien pour se réinstaller. Je conclus que l'emploi est un obstacle important pour les appelants.\n",
      "\tLogement\n",
      "[23] De plus, même s'il n'y a pas de discrimination en matière de logement, il existe des problèmes importants dans ce domaine. Les loyers sont très élevés, et la pénurie de logements s'accentue. Selon une réponse à une demande d'information (RIR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada (CISR) : \n",
      "L'EASO fait observer qu'il existe un [traduction] \" problème de logement \" à Abuja et à Lagos où, selon les estimations, il y aurait un déficit de 600 000 et de 2,5 millions de demeures, respectivement (UE nov. 2018, 39). Un rapport publié en 2016 par la Banque mondiale sur la situation en matière de logement au Nigéria précise ceci : À Lagos, à Ibadan, à Kano et à Abuja, le besoin en logements augmente d'environ 20 p. 100 par année. La production totale actuelle dans le secteur du logement officiel est estimée à 100 000 unités tout au plus. Bien qu'il n'existe aucune donnée fiable, il est évident que le secteur officiel ne produit qu'une fraction du nombre total d'unités urbaines nécessaires chaque année (Banque mondiale 2016, paragraphe 1836).\n",
      "[24] Les éléments de preuve documentaire permettent de conclure que le logement serait un obstacle important pour les appelants.\n",
      "\tSéparation de l'enfant et de ses parents\n",
      "[25] La fille des appelants est une citoyenne canadienne. Si les parents devaient se réinstaller à Abuja, ils devraient choisir entre laisser l'enfant au Canada, où elle recevrait de meilleurs soins médicaux, ou la ramener avec eux dans un pays où elle ne bénéficierait pas du même traitement médical. Une différence au chapitre du traitement médical n'est pas un motif pour conclure qu'une PRI est déraisonnable. Toutefois, en l'espèce, la maladie de l'enfant augmente la probabilité qu'elle soit laissée au Canada pour y recevoir des soins médicaux suffisants. La question est alors de savoir s'il est raisonnable de séparer les parents de leur enfant ou, en d'autres termes, si cette séparation constitue un préjudice indu.\n",
      "[26] La SPR a souligné que la SAR n'est pas une tribune pour trancher les questions d'ordre humanitaire. Cette position a été notée dans la décision Kanagaratnam37. Cependant, la Cour fédérale a par la suite examiné la question de la séparation des enfants des parents dans le contexte d'une PRI, où la question était la séparation des parents et d'un enfant et les difficultés excessives38. Une décision plus récente, Ramachanthran, va au cœur du sujet. La Cour fédérale a ordonné aux décideurs d'examiner la question de savoir si la séparation des enfants et d'un appelant était indûment pénible et déraisonnable; ne pas le faire est une erreur. Je conclus que ce point s'applique en l'espèce. De plus, j'ai pris en compte l'arrêt Ranganathan39, où la Cour d'appel fédérale a souligné que la distinction entre les motifs d'ordre humanitaires ne devrait pas être floue. Cependant, les faits dans l'arrêt Ranganathan sont sensiblement différents, la question n'étant pas la séparation entre les parents et les enfants. La question centrale dont je suis saisie est la séparation; je conclus que les faits en l'espèce se distinguent des faits de l'arrêt Ranganathan. De plus, je ne tiens pas compte de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant; je tiens compte de l'effet de la séparation sur les appelants.\n",
      "[27] J'estime que la conclusion de la décision Ramachanthran s'applique directement en l'espèce. J'ai tenu compte des répercussions que la vie sans leur fille aurait sur les appelants. Je conclus que cela constituerait un préjudice indu pour les appelants.\n",
      "[28] De plus, si les parents décident d'emmener leur fille avec eux à Abuja, ils ne se heurteront pas uniquement à un système médical différent. Leurs responsabilités à l'égard d'une enfant ayant d'un problème médical important auraient une incidence sur leur capacité à trouver un emploi et un logement. Cela augmenterait le niveau de difficulté au point de constituer un préjudice indu.\n",
      "Résumé du caractère raisonnable de la réinstallation à Abuja\n",
      "[29] En l'espèce, l'effet cumulatif des problèmes de logement et d'emploi est tel que les appelants subiraient un préjudice indu s'ils étaient forcés de se réinstaller à Abuja. Les obstacles auxquels ils se heurteraient seraient d'autant plus grands qu'ils ont la responsabilité supplémentaire d'une enfant qui a un problème médical important. Ceci s'inscrit dans le contexte des éléments de preuve documentaire montrant qu'un manque de soutien peut augmenter le niveau de difficulté de réinstallation40. Même s'il existe des éléments de preuve selon lesquels l'appelant principal a un frère et un oncle à Abuja, ceux-ci sont liés aux agents de persécution et ne sont pas susceptibles d'offrir un soutien. Par ailleurs, la séparation d'avec leur enfant, qui nécessite des soins particuliers, constitue une épreuve supplémentaire pour les appelants. Lorsque je prends en compte les répercussions de ces difficultés, ainsi que celles des problèmes d'emploi et de logement, je conclus que la réinstallation à Abuja constitue un préjudice indu. Je conclus qu'il n'est pas raisonnable pour les appelants de se réinstaller à Abuja.\n",
      "Existe-t-il une autre possibilité de refuge intérieur pour les appelants?\n",
      "[30] Je reconnais que les appelants ont de la famille dans l'ensemble du Nigéria. La tribu Isoko, même si elle est minoritaire, est importante. La loi interdisant la violence contre les personnes au Nigéria n'est pas appliquée dans tous les États. Il est peu probable que la protection de l'État s'améliore. En outre, il est probable qu'il y aurait d'autres problèmes de discrimination liés à l'identité autochtone dans d'autres régions41. \n",
      "[31] Il n'y a pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour envisager une autre PRI ou pour envisager la possibilité de renvoyer l'affaire à la SPR.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION \n",

      "OVERVIEW \n",
      "\n",
      "[1] I dismiss this appeal. XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is citizen of India who has appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated February 26, 2018 rejecting his claim for refugee protection on the basis that he had not credibly established that he was a member of the lowest caste group in India and that there was a viable Internal Flight alternative (IFA) available to him in Bangalore or Mumbai.\n",
      "\n",
      "[2] The Appellant fears risk of persecution and harm based on the ethnic persecution that he would face due to his status as a member of a very low status caste group in India. He identifies his ethnicity as Indian Tamil and alleges that he belongs to a low caste known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After suffering from serious caste-based discrimination, the Appellant joined a political group to work on behalf of his caste group but both he and his parents were threatened to stop his political campaigning. Believing that he was not safe in his local village, he fled to Canada to seek refugee protection. Upon arrival in Canada, the Appellant identified himself to the Canada Border Services Agency as a citizen of Sri Lanka. He provided a fake name and passport from Singapore. The Appellant was detained on the basis of identity but eventually released once he disclosed his Indian identity.   \n",
      "\n",
      "[3] The Minister intervened at the RPD on the ground of credibility and inclusion. \n",
      "\n",
      "[4] On appeal it is submitted that the RPD erred in its findings relating to the Appellant's caste group. It is argued that as the RPD made no explicit findings regarding the Appellant's credibility that his testimony and objective evidence that his caste group would be subject to persecution in India should be accepted as the truth. In addition, on appeal it is submitted that that RPD's IFA findings are in error as they are based on the RPD's unreasonable characterization of the Appellant's position on the caste hierarchy. Furthermore, as the Appellant has no family or social connections in Bangalore and Mumbai he would continue to face ethnic persecution.\n",
      "[5] I find that the RPD was correct to find that the Appellant did not credibly establish that he was a member of a low caste group in India who would be subject to a serious forward-looking possibility of persecution. And, furthermore, the RPD's determinative finding that IFA is available to him is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "DECISION\t\n",
      "\n",
      "[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention1 refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "\n",
      "[7] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 A central issue in this case is the Appellant's caste identity. The RPD found that there was insufficient credible evidence to support the Appellant's contention that he belonged to the lowest caste in Indian society and that his social status was on par with or lower than XXXX caste who were subject to more intense discrimination. The RPD found that the objective evidence indicated that the Appellant's caste or social status was considerably different from that of XXXX and that he was far from being perceived as a member of a XXXX XXXX in India. I concur with the RPD for reasons I will outline below. \n",
      "\n",
      "[8] On appeal it is argued that the RPD erred in its assessment of the Appellant's caste identity and that his testimony and the objective evidence demonstrated well beyond a balance of probabilities that the Appellant's caste group is at the lowest rung of India's caste system and he will face discrimination in India that rises to the level of persecution. I find that the RPD correctly assessed the evidence available regarding the Appellant's caste identity and its determination that the Appellant's caste identity was one which would not subject him to a serious possibility of forward-looking persecution is the correct one. \n",
      "\n",
      "[9] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for India indicates that a wide range of abuse can be unleashed on XXXX by dominant caste persons/ communities either to reinforce socio-economic and power inequalities or to suppress their assertion and claims to resources and opportunities for socio-economic development, such as land, fair minimum wages, education, and so on. Violence is used as a tool to subjugate them and crush any form of resistance to protect and assert their dignity because as per the caste system, they were meant to only serve the communities placed on the so-called higher rungs of the caste hierarchy.3 There is also information in the NDP that certain caste groups in India are customarily relegated to the bottom of the caste hierarchy and confined to livelihood tasks viewed as deplorable or deemed too menial by higher caste groups. Their caste-designated occupation reinforces the social stigma that they are unclean or \"untouchable\" and perpetuates widespread discrimination.4\n",
      "\n",
      "[10] First, I find that the RPD was correct to observe that it was unclear exactly where the Appellant was situated in the complicated hierarchy of the Indian caste system. In the Appellant's first Basis of Claim (BOC) Form, there is no specific caste name mentioned. In this first BOC the Appellant states that \"he was from a lower caste and therefore I have to live as a second class citizen or as a slave.\"5 In his amended BOC, the Appellant refers to being a member of the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\".6 At the RPD hearing, the Appellant testified to belonging to these two castes but the spelling he provided was different than that outlined in his amended BOC. Furthermore, the Appellant added a third caste name at the hearing, namely the XXXX XXXX.7 Thus, it was the Appellant's testimony that he belonged to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. When asked by the RPD Member if \"Is that the same thing as a caste? Is it a sub-caste? Is it neither of those?\", the Appellant replied \"All these are castes\". The RPD then asked, \"They're all the same caste?\", to which the Appellant replied that they were.8 Later in the hearing, when confronted with information in the NDP indicating that the caste names he has mentioned are not at the bottom of Indian society and that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Appellant's description of his caste evolves further as follows:\n",
      "The group XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX They are common to both those groups. We are known as the older XXXX XXXX These guys are known as the newer version. They are called XXXX XXXX XXXX Apparently the XXXX have old and new. The older sub-division are the low caste and the higher division is apparently called \"devine\".9\n",
      "\n",
      "[11] The Appellant argues on appeal that the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant belonged to the XXXX XXXX as it was his evidence that he did not belong to this caste and was beaten by members of the XXXX XXXX. I see no such error of fact on the part of the RPD as their decision clearly states as follows: \n",
      "The available evidence is unclear about whether the claimant falls into a sub-caste of the XXXX XXXX, which is considered middle class according to the same RIR, or a lower caste, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, that are also differentiated from XXXX in the available documents.10   \n",
      "\n",
      "[12] As I see it, given the evolving and somewhat confusing nature of the Appellant's testimony regarding his own caste identity, the objective NDP documentary evidence reviewed by the RPD which indicated that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the objective NDP documentary evidence which indicated that the Appellant's caste was not on the lowest rung of society and his own profile, that it was correct for the RPD to find that it was more likely than not that he would be considered to be someone from a low or middle class who has progressed up the social ladder. \n",
      "\n",
      "[13] Importantly and persuasively, the RPD was correct to consider and weigh the Appellant's particular profile in its assessment of his caste identity and whether he belonged to a caste in India which was subject to more intense discrimination. In this case, the Appellant's access to education and employment opportunities in India were not being restricted due to his caste. He is well educated having completed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.11 He was also accepted in an XXXX XXXX XXXX in India. As well, the Appellant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I find that if the Appellant had belonged to the lowest caste system in India, it would be more likely than not that he would not have had access to these educational, employment and professional opportunities which are significantly different than the level of poverty and degrading employment opportunities that the lowest caste members in India are often restricted to.12\n",
      "\n",
      "[14] While I accept that the Appellant has experienced some discrimination, bullying or hardship (particularly in school), not all experiences of discrimination amount to persecution. The Appellant has not established that any future risk, which might flow from any future discrimination, would rise to the level to constitute a serious possibility of persecutory discrimination as defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Handbook.13 Persecution consists of a sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection. \n",
      "\n",
      "[15] For discrimination against a person to amount to persecution, it must be serious and occur with repetition and must have consequences of a prejudicial nature for the person, such as when an individual is denied a core human right, or such as the right to practice religion or to earn a livelihood.14 I observe, as did the RPD, that the Appellant's profile is that he completed post-secondary education, worked in professional occupations and was accepted into law school. All of these factors indicate that he was not prohibited from accessing education, deprived of an ability to make a living or enjoy a higher quality of life because of his caste identity.  \n",
      "\n",
      "[16] Thus I do not agree with the Appellant's argument that his evidence demonstrated that the Appellant belonged to a caste which was at the lowest segment of the Indian class system as if this was true, it would be more likely than not, that he would have been barred from the educational and professional opportunities afforded to him in India. \n",
      "\n",
      "[17] I find that the RPD was correct to find that there was insufficient credible evidence to establish that there is a serious possibility that the Appellant would face persecution on the basis of his caste identity or political opinion as a human rights defender if he were to return to India. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Internal Flight Alternative \n",
      "\n",
      "[18] In order for there to be a viable IFA, the following two factors15 must be met: \n",
      "1. There is no serious possibility of persecution or a danger of torture or risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment (the IFA is safe). \n",
      "2. The IFA is reasonable.\n",
      "[19] Once an IFA has been identified, the burden shifts to the Appellant to show that the IFA is neither safe nor reasonable. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe IFA is safe for the Appellant\n",
      "\n",
      "[20] The RPD found that there was insufficient credible evidence that the agents of harm or persecution who the Appellant said are members of higher castes from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have the ability and intention to find and harm him in the IFA location. In finding that there was no more than a mere possibility that the same agents of persecution would find and harm him in Bungalore or Mumbai, the RPD analyzed the objective NDP evidence and found that the XXXX XXXX was primarily active in states outside of the IFA location, noted that all of the threats and confrontations were localized having occurred in and around his home village, noted the Appellant's relatively low political profile and the fact that his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On appeal, these findings are not contested and having independently reviewed the evidence, I find that the Appellant did not establish that there was more than a mere change of being found in the IFA locations by his persecutors and incurring the risks feared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe IFA is reasonable \n",
      "\n",
      "[21] The second prong of the IFA test is as follows: conditions in the proposed IFA are such that it is not unreasonable, after consideration of all the circumstances and the personal circumstances of the Appellant, for the Appellants to seek refuge there.16\n",
      "\n",
      "[22] The onus on the Appellant to show that the IFA is unreasonable. The Federal Court elaborated on what it considered unreasonable, in the decision in Ranganathan:17 there is a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeoparidize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "[23] On appeal, it is submitted that the RPD erred in its assessment of the reasonableness of the IFA as the RPD erred in its characterization of the Appellant's position on the caste hierarchy. As the Appellant belongs to an extremely low caste, it is argued that he would not be able to live safely and access housing, employment or social services in Bangalore or Mumbai. And further, it is argued that given that the Appellant has no family or social connections in the IFA cities, that he would continue to face ethnic persecution there.\n",
      "\n",
      "[24] I see no error in how the RPD assessed the evidence with respect to the reasonableness of the IFA locations of Bangalore or Mumbai in regards to the Appellant's particular circumstances.  I have already found that the RPD did not err in its determination that the Appellant's caste position was not of a nature that it would subject him to a serious possibility of persecutory discrimination in India or in the IFA locations. Further, the objective evidence reviewed by the RPD, namely RIR IND105526, was correctly assessed by the RPD and this document indicates that there are large Tamil settlements in Bangalore and Mumbai and Tamil enclaves provide a comfortable environment for speaking the Tamil language, worship and the arts.18 This same document indicates that since 2012 in Mumbai and Bungalore that there was no outright discrimination or violent (against Tamil people) although private incidents may have occurred.  Another source in this document indicates that while many Tamils live in slums and poverty that there is a large Tamil middle class in the city of Mumbai and that professionals do well in the all the major cities of India. 19  I have also considered the Appellant's unique profile, namely the fact that he is educated, has held professional position in India, was able to successfully establish social connections with the Tamil community in a new country (Canada) and his supportive family elsewhere in India. These are factors which I find mitigate against a finding that the IFA locations would be unreasonable. \n",
      "\n",
      "[25] For all of the reasons above, I find that the RPD decision was correct to find that the IFA locations of Bangalore and Mumbai are both safe and reasonable. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "[26] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant  is neither a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.  He can relocated to Bangalore or Mumbai which are both safe and reasonable in his particular circumstances.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the appellant) is a citizen of Haiti. She is appealing against the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision rejecting her refugee protection claim on the grounds of a lack of credibility.\n",
      "[2] The appellant alleges that she was arrested, detained, and beaten by police.\n",
      "[3] The appellant argues that the RPD was overly vigilant in concluding that her explanations were unsatisfactory. She argues that the RPD applied North American logic and reasoning and that it conducted a microscopic analysis of the evidence. She states that the RPD member was biased. \n",
      "[4] The RPD found that the claimant was not credible.\n",
      "[5] The determinative issues for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) are whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the appellant's credibility and whether the member was biased.\n",
      "[6] I find that the appellant is not credible and the RPD decision is correct.\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[7] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct to determine that the appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "[8] In her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), the appellant alleges that she started a prayer group with the aim of paying and working for change throughout the country and to free Haiti from corrupt politicians, including President Jovenel Moise and former president Michel Martelly. She alleges that she was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2018, after a meeting that had been organized by her group on XXXX XXXX, 2018. She was detained and beaten for six days and released after her lawyer intervened. She travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and claimed refugee protection on December 31, 2018.\n",
      "Request for oral hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division\n",
      "[9] In support of her appeal memorandum, the appellant requested that an oral hearing be held before the RAD. Subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) states that the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is new admissible evidence that meets the three criteria listed therein.1 In this case, I am of the opinion that there is no cause to hold an oral hearing because the appellant submitted no new evidence in support of her appeal memorandum. For those reasons, the RAD will not hold an oral hearing.\n",
      "Refugee Protection Division findings\n",
      "[10] The RPD made negative findings with respect to the appellant's credibility, for the following reasons:\n",
      "* Omission in her IMM5669 immigration form concerning her arrest and detention;\n",
      "* Omission in her BOC Form concerning the details of her departure from Haiti;\n",
      "* Contradictions about the purchase of her airline ticket to come to Canada;\n",
      "* Omission in her BOC Form concerning the threats made against her partner and son after she left Haiti. Omission in her BOC Form concerning her fear that her son would be kidnapped;\n",
      "* Omission in her BOC Form concerning an injury to her XXXX sustained during her detention;\n",
      "* Unsatisfactory explanation about the fact that her partner and son made no effort to leave Haiti;\n",
      "* Contradictions between her testimony and BOC Form concerning the objectives of her prayer group. Inconsistency involving her statement that the prayer group had no political aim;\n",
      "* The RPD assessed the appellant's fear as a woman and concluded that she would not be alone in Haiti.\n",
      "Grounds for appeal\n",
      "[11] In her appeal memorandum, the appellant argues that the RPD erred as follows:\n",
      "* In criticizing her for failing to indicate in her immigration form that she was arrested and detained by the police because of her political beliefs. She argues that the RPD was overly vigilant with respect to non-essential elements.\n",
      "* In doubting her intentions for purchasing the airline ticket to Canada, which happened before her arrest and detention.\n",
      "* In conducting a microscopic analysis of the fact that she failed to state in her BOC Form that she fears that her son will be kidnapped or that unknown individuals continued to look for her after she left.\n",
      "* In concluding that there was a contradiction between her testimony and her BOC Form concerning the aim of her prayer group, namely whether it had a political aim.\n",
      "* In failing to give any probative value to her lawyer's letter.\n",
      "* In failing to correctly apply the Chairperson's Guideline 4, particularly by minimizing her objective fear in its assessment of her membership in a social group, that of women (alone, afraid of being raped).\n",
      "* In applying North American logic to conclude that she could find a job and live alone in Port-au-Prince and that she would have support from family.\n",
      "* In concluding that her risk is generalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[12] My role is to assess all of the evidence and determine whether the RPD decision is correct.2 In light of Huruglica and Rozas del Solar, and having conducted my own analysis of the record, which included listening to the recording of the hearing and considering all of the evidence, I am of the opinion that I must apply the correctness standard of review.\n",
      "[13] I would like to note that in my decision I considered the Chairperson's Guideline 4,3 given that the appellant's BOC Form refers to allegations that she was detained and beaten during said detention.\n",
      "[14] The RPD noted the appellant's failure to mention in her IMM5669 immigration form that she had been arrested and detained.4 I considered the appellant's explanation, according to which she had not understood the question in the IMM5669 immigration form, and I note that she allegedly filled out the immigration forms without any assistance from an experienced individual. I also note that the appellant submitted her BOC Form without being represented by counsel. I note that the appellant attended her hearing with \"unpaid or otherwise remunerated\" counsel. He stated that he had met the appellant on July 17, 2019, which was the day before the hearing. He stated that he had agreed to help the appellant at her hearing, upon request from one of his closest friends.\n",
      "[15] While I acknowledge the RPD's concern about the omission noted in the IMM5669 immigration form-pertaining to the appellant's detention, which is central to her refugee protection claim-I nevertheless agree with the appellant and I am of the opinion, in these particular circumstances, that her explanations on this point were satisfactory. The RPD's error in this regard will not affect the outcome of the appeal given the other negative conclusions, which are determinative and sufficient. \n",
      "[16] As for the purchase of the airline ticket, I am of the opinion that the appellant's explanations are not satisfactory. When asked to describe her trip to Canada, the appellant spontaneously declared, [translation] \"I had already purchased a ticket because I wanted to come and see what snow was like. I had never seen it.\"5 When asked when she had purchased the ticket the appellant stated, after a moment of silence, that she had purchased it on XXXX XXXX, 2018. When confronted with the contradiction, I note, as did the RPD, that the appellant did not directly answer the question.\n",
      "[17]  I note that after her hearing, the appellant submitted written statements from three people: her mother-in-law, her mother-in-law's brother, and her niece. In his affidavit, the mother-in-law's brother explains that the appellant allegedly purchased her airline ticket on XXXX XXXX, 2018. I note as well that among the evidence submitted after the hearing, the appellant provided a confirmation for a ticket reservation dated XXXX XXXX, 2018, for a flight scheduled for XXXX XXXX, 2018, to Montréal.6 In my opinion, the confirmation of the ticket reservation confirms the appellant's statement at the hearing to the effect that the ticket had already been purchased well before her arrest. I am of the opinion that the evidence presented does not corroborate the appellant's allegations about the date her airline ticket was purchased. I am also of the opinion that it is a central aspect of her refugee protection claim because the appellant stated that she was arrested, detained and released on XXXX XXXX, 2018, two days before she left Haiti. The RPD conclusion on this point is correct.\n",
      "[18] With respect to the allegations the appellant failed to include in her account concerning her fear that her son would be kidnapped, I note that the appellant acknowledged this omission. However, she added that her credibility should not be undermined by this omission. I disagree with the appellant because the omitted allegation highlights the fact that her child had to stop his schooling because of the fear that he would be kidnapped. This is a significant omission and touches on a central element of the appellant's refugee protection claim. When confronted at the hearing, the appellant stated that she was feeling stressed when she filled out her BOC Form. I note that at the beginning of the hearing, the RPD wanted to ensure that the information in the appellant's BOC Form was complete, which she stated that it was. The RPD questioned the appellant as to whether she wished to add anything to her account, to which she replied that she did not. \n",
      "[19] The RPD noted the allegations omitted from the appellant's written account concerning the threats and three visits to her spouse's home before she left Haiti, that is, on XXXX XXXX, 2019; XXXX XXXX, 2019; and XXXX 2019. I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in noting this omission. During the hearing and before she was confronted with this omission, the RPD questioned the appellant as to whether her family has encountered problems since she left Haiti, to which she replied, [translation] \"only stress.\" She then added that her spouse and son had to move and go into hiding because of the threats and visits from those looking for her. She stated that her son stopped attending school on XXXX XXXX, 2018, out of fear that he would be kidnapped by the police who had arrested her. I am of the opinion that the omitted allegations are significant because they are directly tied to the appellant's alleged problems and because they demonstrate the interest and motivation of the agents of persecution to find her despite the fact that she left the country. With respect, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not conduct a microscopic analysis of this and its conclusion is correct.\n",
      "[20] As for the prayer group, the appellant stated that the group was dedicated to praying. However, I note that the appellant's account states the following about the group's objective:\n",
      "[translation]\n",
      "...we had to pray and work for change throughout the country and free it from all of the corrupt politicians who pillaged the country and continue to do so, whether it is JOVENEL MOISE, MICHEL MARTELLY or ARISTIDE. We had to pray and increase the strength of our prayers so that all of those individuals would be judged before a people's court.\n",
      "I wanted a total capital change that would be brought about by women, because it must be understood and known that politicians have clearly failed in our country. I would like to emphasize that it was only a political and peaceful revolution of the liberation gospel...\n",
      "I wanted a new professional army to replace the current police force, which all Haitians know is corrupt because it is often involved in kidnapping and drug trafficking.7\n",
      "[21] The appellant argues that her group did not have a political aim, that it wanted to bring change to society. However, I would like to note that according to the appellant's account, the objective of said group, in addition to prayer, was political change, including changes to the army. The claimant's statement at the hearing contradicted her account and the written statement from the lawyer8 who suggests that her arrest took place [translation] \"for purely political reasons.\" I am of the opinion that this evidence does not corroborate the appellant's statements on this point and that the RPD conclusion is correct.\n",
      "[22] Furthermore, I am of the opinion that the appellant did not discharge her burden of demonstrating how the RPD allegedly committed an error with respect to the Chairperson's Guideline 4. In its decision, the RPD indicates that it took this Guideline into consideration and, in listening to the hearing, it is clear that the RPD member's conduct with the appellant was irreproachable.\n",
      "[23] The appellant argues that the RPD applied North American logic and reasoning to the issue of prospective fear. I note that the appellant does not mention which cultural traits or aspects have come into play. I note that RPD reviewed the appellant's prospective fear as a woman and noted, correctly, that she has her spouse for support as well as the possibility of finding work, given that she has worked in Haiti before. I reviewed this point and I am of the opinion that the appellant is not a member of a group, that of vulnerable women living in rural areas. I am therefore of the opinion that the appellant would not be alone if she were to return to Haiti. \n",
      "[24] I note that the RPD did not conclude that the risk the appellant would be exposed to, as applicable, is generalized, as the appellant argues in her submissions. Having assessed all of the evidence, I am of the opinion that there is not a serious possibility that the appellant would be persecuted in Haiti or that she would be personally subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to the risks set out in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n",
      "Apprehension of bias\n",
      "[25]  The bias test involves asking, \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly?\"9 I note that the appellant did not explain in which circumstances in particular the RPD demonstrated bias. I note that during the hearing, the RPD member was impeccably courteous. His tone was calm throughout the hearing. I do not see any reason to question whether the RPD member was biased.\n",
      "[26] In summary, I conclude that the RPD decision is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION \n",
      "[27] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the determination to the effect that the appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n",

      "[1] Je rejette l'appel. XXXX XXXX (l'appelant) est citoyen de l'Inde.\n",
      "a. L'appelant craint d'être persécuté en Inde parce qu'il appuie le parti Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) (SAD(A)).\n",
      "b. La Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) a conclu que l'appelant dispose d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) en Inde dans les villes de Delhi ou de Mumbai.\n",
      "c. L'appelant soutient en appel que la SPR a manqué à la justice naturelle en ignorant des éléments de preuve qui contredisaient sa décision, qu'elle a commis une erreur dans son analyse des PRI, qu'elle a utilisé de façon sélective les documents objectifs sur le pays et des hypothèses personnelles à l'appui de son analyse, et qu'elle n'a pas tenu compte du profil de l'appelant en tant que partisan du Khalistan.\n",
      "d. La question déterminante pour la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) est celle de savoir si la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant que l'appelant dispose d'une PRI en Inde.\n",
      "e. J'estime que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur. Je conclus que l'appelant dispose d'une PRI à Delhi ou à Mumbai en Inde.\n",
      "\n",
      "DÉCISION\n",
      "\n",
      "[2] Je rejette l'appel. La SPR a eu raison de conclure que l'appelant n'a pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention1 ni qualité de personne à protéger.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONTEXTE\n",
      "\n",
      "[3] L'appelant s'est joint au parti SAD(A) en XXXX 2015. Il a travaillé pour le parti, distribuant de la documentation, faisant la promotion de collectes de sang et participant à des rassemblements.\n",
      "\n",
      "[4] En XXXX 2017, l'appelant a prononcé un discours dans lequel il dénonçait la police. Le lendemain, il a été arrêté par la police locale et détenu pendant quatre jours, durant lesquels il a été battu. Il a été libéré sans accusation après que sa famille a versé un pot-de-vin à la police.\n",
      "\n",
      "[5] En XXXX 2017, l'appelant a été arrêté de nouveau et détenu pendant quatre jours, durant lesquels il a été battu. Il a été libéré sans accusation après que sa famille a versé un autre pot-de-vin à la police. L'appelant affirme que, chaque fois, la police l'a averti de cesser ses activités politiques.\n",
      "\n",
      "[6] Avec l'aide d'un agent, l'appelant a quitté l'Inde en XXXX 2017 et il est venu au Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "OBSERVATIONS DE L'APPELANT\n",
      "\n",
      "[7] À la demande de la SAR, l'appelant a présenté des observations au sujet du point 12.8 du cartable national de documentation (CND) sur l'Inde daté du 17 juillet 20202. J'admets les observations au dossier et j'y ferai référence dans mon analyse.\n",
      "\n",
      "ANALYSE\n",
      "\n",
      "[8] Mon rôle consiste à examiner l'ensemble des éléments de preuve et à établir si la SPR a rendu la décision correcte3. Dans le cadre de mon analyse, j'ai effectué une évaluation indépendante des éléments de preuve et des arguments4.\n",
      "\n",
      "[9] Lorsqu'une personne jure devant la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada que certaines allégations sont vraies, cela crée la présomption qu'elles le sont, à moins qu'il n'y ait une raison de douter de leur véracité. Cette présomption de véracité ne s'applique pas aux inférences ou aux conclusions qu'un témoin peut tirer des faits ni aux hypothèses qui ne s'appuient sur aucun fondement probant5.\n",
      "\n",
      "[10] La présomption selon laquelle le témoignage sous serment d'une personne est véridique peut être réfutée lorsque des problèmes sont relevés dans le témoignage. Il peut notamment s'agir de contradictions, d'incohérences et d'omissions, d'un témoignage incohérent ou vague, d'une méconnaissance des éléments clés de l'affaire ou de l'utilisation de faux documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aucun manquement à la justice naturelle\n",
      "\n",
      "[11] L'appelant soutient en appel que la SPR a manqué à la justice naturelle en ignorant les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait. J'ai examiné de façon indépendante le dossier et la décision de la SPR. J'estime que la SPR a examiné les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait de façon transparente et intelligible. La SPR a examiné la preuve documentaire objective concernant le système d'enregistrement des locataires et la carte Aadhaar6, ainsi que les bases de données et les pratiques de communication de la police 7. Le fait que la SPR ait examiné les éléments de preuve dont elle disposait et tiré une conclusion qui n'était pas favorable à la demande d'asile de l'appelant ne constitue pas un manquement à la justice naturelle.\n",

Je conclus que la preuve montre que l'appelant était un travailleur bénévole de bas échelon au sein du parti SAD(A) et qu'il n'est pas actif sur le plan politique depuis qu'il a quitté l'Inde. L'appelant a déclaré qu'il serait actif sur le plan politique s'il retournait en Inde dans les villes proposées comme PRI. Lorsque la SPR a demandé des détails sur ce militantisme, l'appelant a déclaré qu'il parlerait du parti à d'autres personnes.

Lorsque la SPR l'a interrogé au sujet de son poste au sein de l'organisation du parti, l'appelant a simplement déclaré que les chefs du parti donnaient des directives8. L'appelant ne s'est pas situé dans un rôle de direction au sein de la hiérarchie du parti lorsque la SPR a posé des questions sur l'organisation du parti et le rôle de l'appelant dans celle-ci. Lorsqu'il a été interrogé par la SPR, l'appelant a démontré une compréhension limitée de la philosophie politique et du programme du parti SAD(A).

Il a dit avoir assisté à deux camps de collecte de sang à partir de 2016. L'appelant a déclaré avoir assisté à un rassemblement politique en XXXX 2017 au cours duquel il a prononcé un discours condamnant les pratiques corrompues de l'administration et de la police locales. L'appelant a déclaré qu'il a parlé pendant cinq ou dix minutes à une foule de 10 000 à 12 000 partisans du parti. Il a déclaré avoir dénoncé la police locale pour sa complicité dans le trafic de drogues illicites et pour son défaut de répondre aux besoins de la population.\n",

L'appelant a été arrêté une deuxième fois en XXXX 2017, puis détenu pendant quatre jours et libéré de nouveau sans accusation lorsque sa famille a payé un pot-de-vin. Il a déclaré avoir été battu à chaque occasion et averti de ne pas travailler pour le parti SAD(A). L'appelant a déclaré que le poste de police en question était situé dans une petite ville à environ trois kilomètres de son village du Pendjab.\n",

      "[18] En réponse à une question de la SPR, l'appelant a déclaré qu'il n'est pas actif sur le plan politique depuis qu'il est au Canada. Pressé par son conseil, l'appelant a dit qu'il avait assisté au Canada à des réunions en faveur du Khalistan.\n",

      "[19] L'appelant a déclaré que, s'il retournait en Inde à Delhi ou à Mumbai, il serait de nouveau actif sur le plan politique et que, en raison de ses activités politiques, il risquerait d'être persécuté par la police du Pendjab de même que par les membres du parti Bharatiya Janata (BJP) et du parti du Congrès. Lorsque la SPR l'a questionné sur ces futures activités politiques, l'appelant a déclaré ceci : [traduction] \" Peu importe où je vais, au nom de mon parti, j'exigerai la création de l'État sikh, et si je fais cette demande, ils [la police et les agents du BJP et du Congrès] essaieront de me trouver11 \".

      "[21] Les concepts clés liés à la PRI dans la jurisprudence canadienne proviennent de deux affaires. Le tribunal doit être convaincu, selon la prépondérance des probabilités13 :\n",

L'appelant doit établir que ses agents de persécution ont les moyens et la motivation nécessaires pour le retrouver dans les endroits désignés comme PRI.

      "[25] L'appelant soutient en appel que la SPR a commis une erreur en ne procédant pas à une analyse raisonnable ou complète. J'ai examiné les éléments de preuve et je conclus que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur.\n",

      "[26] L'appelant a déclaré qu'il a été détenu deux fois par la police au Pendjab et qu'il a été libéré sans accusation une fois que sa famille a payé un pot-de-vin. Dans son formulaire Fondement de la demande d'asile (formulaire FDA), l'appelant a écrit ceci : [traduction] \" Les policiers m'ont dit que, parce que je n'avais pas suivi leurs instructions, ils continueraient de me cibler. Les policiers m'ont dit qu'ils pouvaient me trouver n'importe où en Inde et qu'ils pouvaient faire ce qu'ils voulaient sans être tenus responsables de leurs actes. J'étais certain à ce moment-là que la police avait fait de moi une cible permanente et que ma vie était en danger16. \" L'appelant ne fournit aucun détail important dans son formulaire FDA ni dans son témoignage au sujet de ces menaces.

      "[28] La preuve documentaire objective établit qu'il y a 29 services de police d'État autonomes et sept services de police territoriaux en Inde. Ces services de police autonomes sont les services de police locaux dans l'ensemble de l'Inde. La preuve figurant dans le cartable national de documentation (CND) montre que, en 2015, il y avait plus de 73 000 policiers au Pendjab et plus de 1,7 million de policiers dans toute l'Inde18. La preuve documentaire objective indique que la police collabore dans le cas de crimes majeurs. Je ne dispose d'aucune preuve selon laquelle les services de police d'État collaborent avec les services de police d'autres États pour persécuter des personnes qui ont été détenues par la police locale, mais qui n'ont été accusées d'aucun crime et qui ont par la suite été libérées moyennant un pot-de-vin.\n",

      "[29] L'appelant a déclaré avoir quitté l'Inde en utilisant son propre passeport.

      "\n",
      "[30] La SPR a convenu que l'appelant avait établi un fondement subjectif à sa crainte au Pendjab, mais elle a conclu qu'il n'avait pas établi de fondement objectif à sa crainte d'être exposé à une possibilité sérieuse d'être persécuté dans les endroits désignés comme PRI. Je suis d'accord avec la SPR. J'estime que l'appelant n'a pas présenté suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles pour établir que la police du Pendjab ou qui que ce soit d'autre a la motivation nécessaire pour le chercher dans les endroits désignés comme PRI afin de s'en prendre à lui.\n",

      "[31] L'appelant soutient en appel que la police du Pendjab serait en mesure de le retrouver dans les villes proposées comme PRI à l'aide des bases de données associées au système d'inscription des locataires ou à la carte d'identité nationale. L'appelant cite des éléments de preuve objectifs selon lesquels il est difficile en Inde de se réinstaller dans l'anonymat. Étant donné que j'ai conclu que l'appelant n'a pas réussi à établir que les agents de persécution ont la motivation nécessaire pour le chercher dans les endroits désignés comme PRI et s'en prendre à lui, j'estime qu'il n'est pas nécessaire d'examiner plus en détail les moyens par lesquels ils pourraient le faire.\n",
      "\n",
      "[32] L'appelant soutient en appel qu'il serait persécuté dans les endroits proposés comme PRI parce qu'il préconise l'établissement d'un Khalistan indépendant.

J'ai effectué ma propre analyse du profil de l'appelant en tant que membre du SAD(A) ainsi que de la preuve documentaire objective, et je suis d'accord avec la SPR.

      "[33] L'appelant soutient en appel que la SPR a conclu à tort que les endroits proposés comme PRI seraient raisonnables. Dans ses observations à la SAR, l'appelant soutient ce qui suit :\n",
      "[traduction]\n",
      "D'après les éléments de preuve objectifs ci-dessus qui se trouvent au point 12.8 du CND, la ville de Mumbai n'est pas une PRI viable pour l'appelant, compte tenu de sa profonde foi religieuse sikhe, de son appui déclaré envers le Khalistan et de son appartenance au parti politique SADA21.\n",
      "\n",
      "[34] L'appelant cite des éléments de preuve se trouvant au point 12.8 du CND selon lesquels, bien qu'il soit légal d'appuyer le Khalistan en Inde, les sikhs qui préconisent un Khalistan indépendant peuvent attirer l'attention des autorités, tant au Pendjab que dans d'autres États. Le point 12.8 cite des sources selon lesquelles des partisans du Khalistan ont été harcelés par la police et ont été faussement impliqués dans des crimes qui prennent des années à résoudre. L'appelant cite également des éléments de preuve selon lesquels des sikhs ont été traités sévèrement par le système judiciaire pour avoir enfreint les lois sur les armes à feu et les lois contre le terrorisme. L'appelant cite également des sources crédibles selon lesquelles une montée du nationalisme hindou a créé un climat d'intolérance religieuse accrue en Inde et que certains sikhs ont été harcelés par des nationalistes hindous.\n",
      "\n",
      "[35] L'appelant soutient qu'il serait exposé à un risque parce qu'il défend les intérêts du Khalistan. J'ai examiné la preuve concernant les activités politiques de l'appelant. J'ai constaté qu'il n'a pas de profil de militant politique qui le mettrait en danger dans les endroits proposés comme PRI.\n",
      "\n",
      "[36] La SPR a examiné à fond le caractère raisonnable des endroits proposés comme PRI. Elle a cité des éléments de preuve objectifs selon lesquels il y a des communautés sikhes à Delhi et à Mumbai et que les communautés sikhes minoritaires à l'extérieur du Pendjab ont accès au logement, à l'emploi, aux soins de santé, à l'éducation et à la liberté de pratiquer leur religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "[37] La preuve documentaire objective figurant dans le CND, y compris celle citée par l'appelant, établit qu'il y a eu des cas où des sikhs ont été victimes de discrimination dans la société indienne et ont été traités durement par le système judiciaire indien. Néanmoins, la preuve indique ce qui suit :\n",
      "Selon le rapport du DFAT de l'Australie, [traduction] \" depuis la fin des années 1980 et le début des années 1990, les sikhs vivent pacifiquement en Inde et la majorité ne subissent pas de discrimination sociale ou de violence \" [caractères gras ajoutés par la SAR] (Australie 17 oct. 2018, paragr. 3.19). De même, au cours d'un entretien téléphonique avec la Direction des recherches, un professeur agrégé au Collège de Hiram qui mène des recherches sur la politique en Asie du Sud a déclaré que les sikhs à l'extérieur du Pendjab sont intégrés économiquement et socialement dans les communautés où ils vivent et sont généralement en sécurité, malgré des cas isolés de discrimination, par exemple le baptême forcé de sikhs et l'interdiction d'entrer dans des endroits publics sans retirer les symboles religieux, notamment l'exigence de retirer le turban et le kirpan pour les examens d'admission aux programmes éducatifs; toutefois, ces affaires sont habituellement réglées par les tribunaux locaux ou la police (professeur agrégé 26 sept. 2019). Selon la réponse conjointe du représentant de la WSO et du professeur agrégé, les sikhs peuvent avoir de la difficulté à s'intégrer dans les régions où il n'existe pas de communauté sikhe et, en particulier pour les sikhs pratiquants, [traduction] \" dans les autres États indiens qui ne connaissent pas aussi bien l'identité sikhe \" (WSO et professeur agrégé 3 mai 2019)22.\n",
      "\n",
      "[38] J'estime que les éléments de preuve contenus dans le CND confirment que les sikhs peuvent vivre en paix à Delhi et à Mumbai. J'estime que la preuve de harcèlement et de discrimination contre les sikhs en Inde n'atteint pas le niveau de la persécution. La preuve appuie la conclusion selon laquelle les sikhs jouissent généralement d'un certain niveau de protection contre la police et le système judiciaire.\n",
      "\n",
      "[39] L'appelant a déclaré qu'il ne pouvait pas se réinstaller dans les endroits proposés comme PRI parce qu'il ne possède pas les qualifications et les relations nécessaires pour obtenir un emploi, et qu'il ne parle pas les langues majoritaires à Delhi et à Mumbai. La SPR a cité la preuve objective selon laquelle les langues prédominantes à Delhi sont l'hindi, le pendjabi, l'ourdou et l'anglais. L'appelant parle le pendjabi et un peu d'anglais.\n",
      "\n",
      "[40] Dans une décision récente concernant une PRI en Inde, le juge Roy a souligné que la Cour d'appel fédérale a établi un seuil très élevé pour le deuxième volet :\n",
      "[...] Dans Ranganathan, après avoir cité de longs passages des motifs du juge d'appel Linden dans l'arrêt Thirunavukkarasu c Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration), [1994] 1 CF 589, en soulignant les extraits où la Cour d'appel insiste que l'attrait de la PRI n'est pas pertinent, la Cour d'appel conclut :\n",
      "[15] Selon nous, la décision du juge Linden, pour la Cour d'appel, indique qu'il faille placer la barre très haute lorsqu'il s'agit de déterminer ce qui est déraisonnable. Il ne faut rien de moins que l'existence de conditions qui mettraient en péril la vie et la sécurité d'un revendicateur tentant de se relocaliser temporairement en lieu sûr. De plus, il faut une preuve réelle et concrète de l'existence de telles conditions. L'absence de parents à l'endroit sûr, prise en soi ou conjointement avec d'autres facteurs, ne peut correspondre à une telle condition que si cette absence a pour conséquence que la vie ou la sécurité du revendicateur est mise en cause. Cela est bien différent des épreuves indues que sont la perte d'un emploi ou d'une situation, la diminution de la qualité de vie, le renoncement à des aspirations, la perte d'une personne chère et la frustration des attentes et des espoirs d'une personne.\n",
      "Comme le note la Cour au paragraphe 17, il ne faut pas brouiller la différence entre la demande de statut de réfugié et la demande fondée sur des raisons d'ordre humanitaire23.\n",
      "\n",
      "[41] J'estime que l'appelant n'a pas fourni de preuve concrète de conditions qui mettraient en péril sa vie et sa sécurité dans les villes proposées comme PRI. Même si l'appelant devra sans aucun doute surmonter d'importantes difficultés pour se réinstaller à Delhi ou à Mumbai, j'estime que ces difficultés ne sont pas suffisantes pour satisfaire aux exigences rigoureuses énoncées dans le deuxième volet du critère relatif à la PRI pour que la PRI soit considérée comme déraisonnable.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "[42] Je rejette l'appel et confirme la décision attaquée selon laquelle l'appelant n'a pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni qualité de personne à protéger.\n",

      "APERÇU\n",
      "[1] Il est fait droit à l'appel. L'appelante, XXXX XXXX XXXX, a interjeté appel de la décision rendue par la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR), qui a rejeté sa demande d'asile. La SPR a conclu qu'il n'y avait pas suffisamment d'éléments de preuve crédibles pour établir que l'appelante craint d'être persécutée par le gouvernement éthiopien au motif de son opinion politique. La SPR a également établi que l'origine ethnique tigréenne de l'appelante principale, en soi, ne suffit pas pour appuyer une demande d'asile. La SPR a également rejeté la demande d'asile présentée sur place1.\n",
      "Motifs de décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés\n",
      "[2] La SPR a tiré des conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité en se fondant sur les incohérences et omissions suivantes dans les éléments de preuve :\n",
      "a) Quand des questions lui ont été posées au sujet des particularités de sa participation active au sein du Parti Bleu, l'appelante a omis de mentionner dans son témoignage qu'elle contribuait financièrement au parti, comme elle l'avait déclaré dans le formulaire Fondement de la demande d'asile (formulaire FDA), et les reçus des contributions financières faisaient partie des éléments de preuve documentaire présentés. Il s'agit d'une omission importante parce que les éléments de preuve objectifs sur le pays montrent que ces reçus sont utilisés comme preuve informelle d'adhésion au parti2.\n",
      "b) La SPR n'a pas cru que l'appelante avait déjà été détenue parce qu'elle s'était contredite dans son témoignage à savoir si elle avait été détenue en 2015 ou en 2017, et que le formulaire FDA ne précisait pas si elle s'était présentée aux autorités, comme elle était tenue de le faire, après avoir été remise en liberté3.\n",
      "c) En raison de l'incohérence dans le témoignage de l'appelante concernant la détention et des écarts dans le rapport médical, la SPR n'a pas cru que l'appelante avait été battue par les autorités durant une manifestation à laquelle elle avait participé en 20154.\n",
      "d) Le rapport psychologique n'a pas atténué les préoccupations de la SPR quant à la crédibilité parce qu'il est fondé sur l'autodéclaration de l'appelante et que celle-ci n'avait pas été crédible quant à ce qu'elle ressentait lors de la première séance et en raison d'autres aspects de la demande d'asile. Le tribunal a conclu qu'il n'est pas crédible que l'appelante n'ait pas su que son anxiété avait eu une incidence sur son témoignage avant que le psychologue l'en ait informée5.\n",
      "e) La SPR a conclu que l'association de l'appelante avec un groupe de soutien du Parti Bleu au Canada n'est pas authentique au motif que ce groupe n'avait pas été mentionné dans formulaire FDA et dans ses versions modifiées et que l'appelante ne connaissait pas le nom complet de l'auteur de la lettre de soutien ni le véritable nom du groupe6.\n",
      "f) La SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile sur place au motif que l'association de l'appelante avec le groupe de soutien du Parti Bleu au Canada n'est pas authentique, qu'il n'est pas crédible qu'elle ait été incapable de confirmer par elle-même la nature menaçante d'un appel anonyme qu'elle a reçu au Canada et qu'il est peu probable que les autorités en Éthiopie soient mises au courant de ses activités au Canada7.\n",
      "g) L'origine ethnique de l'appelante, en soi, n'appuie pas un risque de persécution parce que le dirigeant du gouvernement éthiopien est d'origine ethnique tigréenne8.\n",
      "Arguments de l'appelante\n",
      "[3] L'appelante a fait valoir que les omissions relevées par la SPR sont accessoires et n'ont pas d'importance pour la demande d'asile et que le rapport psychologique atténue les préoccupations de la SPR quant à la crédibilité. L'omission de détails mineurs et accessoires du formulaire FDA n'est pas préoccupante, car ce formulaire est souvent rempli par des représentants ayant un point de vue différent concernant l'importance9.\n",
      "DÉCISION\n",
      "[4] Il est fait droit à l'appel. Je substitue à la décision rendue ma propre décision selon laquelle l'appelante a qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention.\n",
      "RÔLE DE LA SECTION D'APPEL DES RÉFUGIÉS\n",
      "[5] En ce qui concerne les questions de droit, de fait ou mixtes de fait et de droit, la norme de contrôle que la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) doit appliquer est celle de la décision correcte10. La SAR peut faire preuve de déférence à l'égard d'une conclusion de la SPR lorsque celle-ci a joui d'un avantage certain dans l'appréciation de la crédibilité des témoignages de vive voix11. La SAR effectue sa propre analyse du dossier, selon la norme de la décision correcte, afin d'établir si la SPR a commis une erreur12. Comme la SPR ne jouissait d'aucun avantage certain dans l'évaluation de la crédibilité du témoignage de vive voix présenté dans le cadre de cette demande d'asile, j'applique la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte à sa décision.\n",
      "ANALYSE\n",
      "Rapport psychologique\n",
      "[6] À la suite de la première séance de l'audience de la SPR, l'appelante a présenté un rapport psychologique qui a été pris en considération lors de la deuxième séance de cette audience. La SPR a commis des erreurs dans l'évaluation de ce rapport, lesquelles ont amené le tribunal à rejeter le rapport dans le cadre de l'évaluation du témoignage de l'appelante. Ainsi, la SPR a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte de l'état de santé mentale de l'appelante durant le témoignage.  \n",
      "[7] Le rapport psychologique établissait que l'appelante présentait des symptômes correspondant au stress post-traumatique, à l'anxiété généralisée et à la dépression majeure. Le psychologue a constaté que l'appelante était profondément traumatisée par le harcèlement, les menaces, la violence et la crainte qu'elle a vécus en Éthiopie. Selon le rapport psychologique, elle a déclaré qu'elle s'était sentie confuse et qu'elle avait eu de la difficulté à entendre ou à parler lors de la première séance de l'audience de la SPR. Elle a affirmé avoir revécu les événements traumatisants et avoir été distraite par des pensées négatives, qui ont eu un effet néfaste sur sa concentration et sa mémoire à court terme. Ces sentiments se sont manifestés par une difficulté à retenir et à se rappeler l'information13.\n",
      "[8] La SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur évidente dans son évaluation du rapport psychologique. La SPR a écrit que le rapport psychologique énonçait que les questions posées par le tribunal à la demandeure d'asile lui ont rappelé un interrogatoire qu'elle avait subi, ce qui a provoqué chez elle une surstimulation psychologique due à la répulsion, y compris des pleurs14. La SPR a mal interprété le rapport psychologique quand elle a nié que l'appelante avait pleuré à l'audience devant elle15. Le rapport psychologique énonçait non pas que l'appelante avait pleuré à l'audience devant la SPR, mais plutôt qu'elle l'avait fait durant l'entrevue avec le psychologue16. \n",
      "[9] Une autre erreur commise par la SPR a été de rejeter les avis professionnels donnés dans le rapport psychologique parce que l'appelante n'avait pas expliqué comment elle se sentait au commissaire de la SPR17. Lors de la première séance de l'audience de la SPR, l'appelante a signalé qu'elle avait besoin de prendre une minute pour se rappeler ses souvenirs18. Comme elle l'a expliqué à la deuxième séance, elle ne savait pas, lors de la première séance, qu'elle devrait dévoiler ses sentiments dans la salle d'audience19. Comme le counseling psychologique permet de prendre conscience de son état mental d'une manière qui peut être formulée, j'admets l'explication de l'appelante selon laquelle elle n'a pris conscience de ses problèmes d'anxiété qu'après que le psychologue l'a informée du fait20.\n",
      "Les incohérences dans le témoignage sont dues au fait que l'appelante a revécu un traumatisme \n",
      "[10] Sous la rubrique [traduction] \" Détention \", l'exposé circonstancié du formulaire FDA décrivait un incident survenu en 2015, quand l'appelante avait été battue par des policiers durant une manifestation antigouvernementale. Elle avait pu éviter d'être arrêtée parce que les policiers l'avaient laissée pour aller battre un autre manifestant. Elle a perdu une dent dans le cadre de cet incident. Plus loin dans l'exposé circonstancié du formulaire FDA, sous la rubrique [traduction] \" Décision de quitter le pays \", l'appelante a prétendu avoir été détenue pendant huit jours, en XXXX 2017, parce qu'elle avait distribué des dépliants d'opposition à une taxation injuste. Durant la période de détention, elle se faisait harceler et humilier quand elle se faisait interroger. L'appelante a été remise en liberté grâce à une caution versée par sa mère et à condition qu'elle se présente au poste de police une fois par mois21.\n",
      "[11] Dans le cadre de son témoignage, l'appelante a hésité quant à savoir si elle avait été détenue en 2015 ou en 2017 : elle a d'abord déclaré avoir été détenue le XXXX XXXX 2015, puis a affirmé que c'était le XXXX XXXX 2017. Elle a ensuite déclaré n'avoir été détenue qu'une fois et que cette détention avait eu lieu en 2015. Après que la SPR lui a posé des questions de suivi pour clarifier le témoignage, l'appelante a de nouveau affirmé que 2017 était la date de la détention22. Appelée à expliquer l'écart quant à savoir si elle avait été détenue en 2015 ou en 2017, l'appelante a déclaré qu'elle se souvenait de la fois où elle avait été torturée et avait perdu sa dent23.\n",
      "[12] J'admets l'argument de l'appelante selon lequel le rapport psychologique fournit une explication du témoignage changeant relativement à la date de la détention. Je ne souscris pas à la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les pauses dans le témoignage sont révélatrices du fait que l'appelante avait répété l'exposé circonstancié et avait cafouillé au moment de le réciter24. \n",
      "[13] \n",
      "[14] \n",
      "[15] L'explication donnée par la SPR pour sa conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité n'était ni logique ni intelligible dans son association de la date de naissance de l'appelante en XXXX avec le mois même où elle avait été battue à la manifestation25.\n",
      "[1] . \n",
      "[13]  Compte tenu du rapport psychologique, si j'examine le témoignage de façon indépendante, j'estime que les incohérences qu'il contient et leur explication reflètent le fait que l'appelante a revécu des événements traumatisants. J'admets l'avis énoncé dans le rapport psychologique selon lequel le fait de revivre un traumatisme a distrait l'appelante et l'a empêchée de se rappeler des informations26.\n",
      "[14] J'admets l'argument de l'appelante selon lequel elle a fait des pauses durant le témoignage dans le but de se rappeler l'incident27. Pendant que les questions relatives à la détention lui étaient posées, elle a affirmé plusieurs fois qu'elle tentait de se remémorer cet événement dans le but de répondre aux questions de la SPR. Elle a aussi demandé qu'une minute lui soit accordée afin de se rappeler des faits28. Lors de la deuxième séance de l'audience de la SPR, l'appelante a expliqué qu'elle avait demandé une minute à la première séance dans le but de se calmer, de sorte qu'elle puisse se remémorer les événements pour répondre aux questions de la SPR29. Je conclus que le besoin de l'appelante de prendre un instant dans son témoignage pour se rappeler les faits est dû à l'état psychologique causé par le fait de revivre un traumatisme. \n",
      "Les omissions dans les éléments de preuve n'ont pas d'incidence défavorable sur la crédibilité de l'appelante \n",
      "Omission de mentionner des contributions financières dans le témoignage \n",
      "[15] Appelée à préciser ce qui faisait d'elle un membre actif du Parti Bleu, l'appelante a déclaré qu'elle assistait à des rencontres d'étudiant, qu'elle participait à des manifestations, qu'elle faisait la promotion des élections et qu'elle recrutait des membres étudiants, mais elle n'a jamais mentionné ses contributions financières30, même si les reçus de ces contributions monétaires faisaient partie des éléments de preuve documentaire31.\n",
      "[16] Je ne tire pas de conclusion défavorable de l'omission. À la lumière du rapport psychologique, j'admets l'ex plication de l'appelante selon laquelle les contributions financières ne lui sont tout simplement pas venues à l'esprit durant le témoignage32. De plus, même sans le rapport psychologique, l'omission n'est pas assez importante pour que je puisse tirer une conclusion défavorable, étant donné que la question de la SPR portait sur sa participation [traduction] \" active \"33 et qu'il est possible de faire valoir que des contributions financières ne sont pas une forme de participation active. Pour illustrer la distinction entre une participation active et l'apport de contributions financières, il est possible de faire une analogie avec la comparaison entre faire du bénévolat et faire un don financier. Le bénévolat est une forme active de participation, et il est possible de faire valoir que les contributions financières sont plus passives. Quand la SPR a posé une question portant précisément sur la participation active, l'appelante a répondu en nommant des activités qui exigeaient sa participation active, comme le fait d'assister à des rencontres, de participer à des manifestations et de promouvoir les élections. En comparaison, le versement d'une contribution financière est une forme passive de soutien qui ne requiert pas d'interaction active avec d'autres personnes. \n",
      "[17] Après que la SPR a examiné les reçus originaux des contributions financières, elle n'a remarqué aucun indice de fraude à première vue. Ainsi, le tribunal a commis une erreur en n'attribuant aucun poids aux reçus et en concluant que l'omission dans le témoignage minait de façon importante l'allégation selon laquelle l'appelante était un membre du Parti Bleu en Éthiopie34.\n",
      "[18] À la lumière de l'examen indépendant des éléments de preuve par la SAR, j'estime que le témoignage de l'appelante concernant sa participation aux activités du Parti Bleu concorde sensiblement avec le formulaire FDA. L'allégation selon laquelle elle est membre du Parti Bleu a été établie par son témoignage, les reçus des contributions financières et les éléments de preuve objectifs selon lesquels les contributions financières sont une preuve d'adhésion au parti35.\n",
      "\tOmission de mentionner des détails concernant l'allégation de persécution du frère dans le formulaire FDA \n",
      "[19] Dans le formulaire FDA, les détails relatifs au fait que le frère de l'appelante avait été battu, menacé et interdit de fréquentation scolaire par les autorités éthiopiennes ont été omis36. L'appelante a fait valoir que le vécu de son frère, qui l'a poussée à demander l'asile en Suisse en 2013, est un aspect qui n'est pas au cœur de sa demande d'asile à elle37. J'admets le témoignage de l'appelante selon lequel les détails sur le vécu de son frère ont été omis du formulaire FDA parce qu'elle croyait que sa propre demande d'asile dépendait uniquement de sa propre situation38. Le formulaire FDA n'est pas destiné à la rédaction d'un recueil encyclopédique des éléments de preuve, et les détails concernant le vécu du frère sont accessoires par rapport à la demande d'asile de l'appelante39.\n",
      "\tOmission de mentionner des renseignements sur la famille dans la demande de visa \n",
      "[20] La SPR a commis une erreur en tirant une conclusion défavorable de l'omission de mentionner la fratrie de l'appelante dans sa demande de visa. Cette dernière a déclaré avoir omis d'y inscrire les renseignements sur sa fratrie parce qu'elle suivait les directives données par la personne de l'agence de voyages qui préparait la demande de visa40. Je me fonde sur la jurisprudence selon laquelle il n'est pas rare qu'une personne fuyant la persécution suive les directives de la personne qui organise son évasion; par conséquent, la véracité des renseignements que ces personnes inscrivent dans les documents qu'elles utilisent pour fuir a peu d'incidence directe sur le fait de savoir si la personne est véritablement un réfugié41. Ainsi, j'estime que le fait que l'appelante n'ait pas mentionné sa fratrie dans sa demande de visa n'a pas d'importance par rapport à la question de la crédibilité. \n",
      "Omission de mentionner des activités menées au Canada dans le formulaire Fondement de la demande d'asile \n",
      "[21] L'appelante a fait des déclarations au sujet des activités qu'elle mène au sein du Parti Bleu au Canada, mais ces détails ne figurent pas dans le formulaire FDA42. J'estime que l'omission de ses activités dans ce formulaire est importante en ce qui a trait à la demande d'asile sur place; toutefois, elle n'a pas d'incidence sur la crédibilité des allégations de persécution en Éthiopie faites dans la demande d'asile principale.\n",
      "Sortie de l'Éthiopie \n",
      "[22] Dans le cadre de l'examen indépendant de la SAR, j'ai tenu compte des points 14.2 et 14.3 du cartable national de documentation43 (CND) et de l'avis d'expert de XXXX XXXX présenté par l'appelante44. \n",
      "[23] La SPR a tenu compte des éléments de preuve objectifs sur la situation dans le pays selon lesquels même les membres de l'opposition de rang inférieur risquent d'être détenus, emprisonnés ou tués en Éthiopie et la plupart des membres de l'opposition qui quittent le pays se rendent généralement au Kenya en autobus ou par un autre moyen de transport terrestre pour éviter d'être appréhendés45. La SPR a fait remarquer, à juste titre, que la demandeure d'asile s'était exposée à un risque en choisissant de voyager par avion46. Toutefois, l'appelante a fait valoir que la SPR avait exagéré le risque associé au choix de voyager par avion après avoir mal interprété l'avis d'expert de XXXX XXXX XXXX selon lequel le gouvernement éthiopien, d'une part, empêche les dirigeants de parti de quitter le pays, tout en permettant, d'autre part, à des membres de la base de quitter le pays pour les empêcher d'atteindre le rang de dirigeant47.\n",
      "[24] Je me fonde sur la jurisprudence de la Cour fédérale du Canada selon laquelle les éléments de preuve sur la situation dans le pays montrent que les Éthiopiens s'opposant au gouvernement courent un risque en quittant le pays par voie aérienne, mais qu'il n'est pas invraisemblable qu'ils puissent le faire. La possibilité qu'un risque ne se concrétise jamais est inhérente à la notion de risque48. Je souscris à l'argument de l'appelante selon lequel la SPR aurait dû lui demander comment elle perçoit le risque associé au fait de voyager par voie aérienne pour quitter l'Éthiopie avant de tirer une conclusion défavorable fondée sur le choix de ce mode de transport. \n",
      "[25] J'ai invalidé les conclusions défavorables de la SPR quant à la crédibilité, selon lesquelles l'appelante récitait un témoignage qu'elle avait répété et n'était pas membre du Parti Bleu en Éthiopie. En l'absence de telles conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité, j'estime que la décision de l'appelante de courir le risque de quitter l'Éthiopie par voie aérienne est un facteur neutre dans l'évaluation de la crédibilité. \n",
      "L'appelante s'est réclamée à nouveau de la protection de l'Éthiopie depuis les Émirats arabes unis \n",
      "[26] La SPR a conclu que l'appelante avait rehaussé la demande d'asile en prétendant que sa famille était ciblée en Éthiopie parce qu'elle avait eu la possibilité de quitter le pays de façon permanente quand elle s'était rendue aux Émirats arabes unis en XXXX 2014 pour prendre des vacances, mais qu'elle a choisi de retourner en Éthiopie49. Elle a expliqué qu'elle ne serait pas en sécurité à Dubaï, étant donné que cette ville est située à proximité de l'Éthiopie.  \n",
      "[27] J'estime que la décision de l'appelante de retourner en Éthiopie après s'entre rendue à Dubaï est un facteur neutre qui ne m'incite pas à tirer une conclusion défavorable. Trois critères doivent être respectés pour qu'il soit possible de conclure qu'un demandeur d'asile s'est réclamé à nouveau de la protection d'un pays au titre de la Convention : a) il doit s'en être réclamé à nouveau volontairement; b) le demandeur d'asile doit avoir eu l'intention de se réclamer à nouveau de la protection du pays dont il a la nationalité;  c) la personne doit avoir effectivement obtenu cette protection50. J'estime que l'appelante n'a jamais eu l'intention de se réclamer à nouveau de la protection de l'État lorsqu'elle est retournée en Éthiopie, et elle n'a pas non plus obtenu cette protection, car elle a été détenue, interrogée et menacée en 2017, ce qui l'a poussée à quitter l'Éthiopie plusieurs mois plus tard. \n",
      "[28] J'admets le témoignage de l'appelante selon lequel, malgré le fait que sa famille était ciblée, elle n'a pas quitté l'Éthiopie avant 2018 parce qu'elle croyait que son militantisme politique pourrait amener du changement. Elle a décidé après sa remise en liberté en XXXX 2017 de quitter l'Éthiopie parce que les autorités lui avaient donné un avertissement final concernant le fait qu'elle devrait se joindre au parti Hewat (transcription phonétique)51. Les efforts qu'elle a déployés dans le but de provoquer un changement politique sont évidents dans l'ensemble des éléments de preuve. Plus tôt, elle avait déclaré avoir reçu des appels téléphoniques anonymes intimidants, lorsqu'elle fréquentait l'université, la menaçant quant au fait qu'elle devrait être membre du parti du Front de libération des peuples du Tigré (Tigray People's Liberation Front)52. Ce témoignage concorde avec les déclarations figurant dans l'exposé circonstancié du formulaire FDA, selon lesquelles elle avait reçu des appels téléphoniques visant à tenter de l'intimider pour qu'elle change ses croyances politiques53.\n",
      "Lettres de soutien \n",
      "[29] La SPR a commis une erreur en rejetant les lettres de soutien des parents et amis de l'appelante au motif de ce qui n'y figurait pas plutôt que de leur contenu :\n",
      "a. La SPR a conclu que la lettre des parents manquait de crédibilité parce qu'elle ne fournit pas de renseignements à jour au sujet de la situation de l'appelante et de ses parents et qu'elle ne précise pas s'il y a eu des conséquences à son défaut de se présenter au poste de police54.\n",
      "b. La SPR n'a attribué aucun poids à la lettre de XXXX XXXX, l'ami de l'université qui a été arrêté avec l'appelante pour avoir manifesté contre des taxes injustes, car elle ne mentionne pas l'obligation pour l'appelante de se présenter au poste de police après sa mise en liberté sous caution55.\n",
      "c. La SPR n'a attribué aucun poids à la lettre de XXXX XXXX, l'ami qui a demandé à l'appelante de se joindre au Parti Bleu en Éthiopie, parce qu'elle ne mentionne pas le fait que l'appelante versait des contributions financières56.\n",
      "d. La SPR n'a attribué aucun poids à la lettre de XXXX XXXX, l'amie de l'appelante qui a écrit au sujet des activités qu'elles menaient à l'école secondaire, car elle ne mentionnait pas les activités politiques de l'appelante57. \n",
      "[30] La Cour fédérale du Canada a formulé une mise en garde contre le fait de tirer des conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité en se fondant sur ce qui ne figure pas dans les éléments de preuve documentaire, car il n'est pas exigé que chaque élément de preuve traite de chacun des points particuliers en litige. Certains éléments de preuve sont des renseignements contextuels, et certains documents comblent des lacunes. Aucun élément ne doit être écarté simplement parce qu'il est un élément de l'ensemble58. Par conséquent, j'estime que la SPR a commis une erreur en n'évaluant pas la valeur probante des lettres en se fondant sur ce qui y est énoncé dans le contexte de l'ensemble de la preuve. \n",
      "[31] À la lumière de l'examen indépendant des éléments de preuve documentaire par la SAR :\n",
      "e. J'accorde un poids favorable à la lettre des parents parce qu'elle corrobore les activités de l'appelante au sein du Parti Bleu en Éthiopie, y compris le rassemblement de 2015 dans le cadre duquel elle a été battue, ainsi que l'arrestation et la détention de l'appelante en 2017, à la suite de son opposition à la taxation injuste des petites entreprises de sa collectivité. La lettre décrit la somme de la caution versée aux fins de la libération de l'appelante; la condition de remise en liberté selon laquelle l'appelante devait se présenter au poste de police; et les sommes recueillies par la famille dans le but de l'aider à quitter l'Éthiopie59.\n",
      "f. J'attribue un poids favorable à la lettre de XXXX XXXX, qui raconte que l'appelante principale distribuait des dépliants pour s'opposer à une taxation injuste. L'auteur de la lettre a été arrêté avec l'appelante60.\n",
      "g. J'accorde un poids favorable à la lettre de XXXX XXXX. La lettre prouve que l'auteur a demandé à l'appelante de se joindre au Parti Bleu en Éthiopie61.\n",
      "h. Je n'attribue aucun poids à la lettre de XXXX XXXX, car la lettre décrit les activités menées par l'appelante à l'école secondaire, ce qui ne prouve pas les allégations faites dans la demande d'asile62.\n",
      "i. Je n'attribue aucun poids au billet médical, car il est illisible63. Il n'est pas possible de confirmer ce qui est inscrit dans ce billet qui est censé corroborer la perte d'une dent par l'appelante après qu'elle a été battue lors de la manifestation.\n",
      "[32] Comme la présomption de véracité n'a pas été réfutée, j'admets le témoignage de l'appelante selon lequel elle se présentait au poste de police au cours des derniers jours du mois, conformément aux conditions de sa remise en liberté, et elle s'y est présentée pour la dernière fois en XXXX 201764.\n",
      "[33] J'estime qu'il y a suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour établir que les incidents survenus en Éthiopie appuient une crainte prospective de persécution fondée sur l'opinion politique si l'appelante retournait en Éthiopie. Comme j'ai admis la demande d'asile principale, il n'est pas nécessaire que j'évalue la demande d'asile sur place. \n",

      "APERÇU\n",
      "[1] Madame XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (l'appelante) est une citoyenne du Mexique. \n",
      "[2] L'appelante craint son ex-conjoint, un individu ayant des contacts au gouvernement, avec qui elle a habité depuis mai 2008 et qui l'a harcelée psychologiquement, en lui prenant son argent, limitant ses déplacements et la considérait comme sa propriété. Malgré qu'elle ait déménagé, l'homme l'a retrouvée, surveillée et menacée. \n",
      "[3]  La Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) a conclu que l'appelante n'est pas crédible en raison du manque de spontanéité de son témoignage. Elle estime que son allégation qu'elle avait arrêté de voir ses enfants depuis le début de sa relation est contredite par les informations sur son profil Facebook déposées par le ministre. Elle pointe deux omissions importantes relevées dans le formulaire du Fondement de la demande d'asile (FDA) en lien avec le témoignage écrit du fils sur la violence commise par l'ex-conjoint à son égard. \n",
      "[4] L'appelante allègue que la SPR a erré dans son analyse de sa crédibilité. Elle soumet que la contradiction soulevée concernant sa relation avec ses enfants n'est pas essentielle dans l'histoire et qu'elle a donné une explication raisonnable aux incertitudes soulevées. Elle soumet que ses allégations concernant la persécution au Mexique sont claires dans son témoignage devant la SPR et dans son FDA. Elle explique avoir cru que le dépôt de l'affidavit de son fils serait suffisant pour présenter l'attaque contre lui de son ex-conjoint. Elle soumet avoir établi que son ex-conjoint la cherche toujours et qu'il y a plus qu'une simple possibilité qu'elle subisse de la persécution et que sa vie est en danger.\n",
      "[5] Pour la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR), les questions déterminantes sont de savoir si la SPR a erré dans son analyse de la crédibilité de l'appelante, si elle pouvait bénéficier d'une protection adéquate de l'État mexicain et d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DÉCISION    \n",
      "[6] Il est fait droit à l'appel. Je substitue à la décision attaquée ma propre décision selon laquelle l'appelante a qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention.\n",
      "ANALYSE\n",
      "[7] Mon rôle consiste à examiner l'ensemble de la preuve, incluant l'écoute de l'audience devant la SPR, et à établir si sa décision est correcte1. Le ministre est intervenu devant la SPR, mais pas devant la SAR. \n",
      "[8] Le 18 septembre 2020, la SAR a fait parvenir à l'appelante un avis de nouvelles questions déterminantes sur la protection de l'État mexicain et sur une PRI dans les villes de Mexico ou de Mérida. La SAR a invité l'appelante à déposer ses observations sur ces nouvelles questions. Le 1er octobre 2020, l'appelante a déposé ses observations en réponse à l'avis de la SAR et n'a pas déposé de nouvelle preuve. \n",
      "L'appelante est crédible \n",
      "La SAR ne tire pas d'inférence négative sur la crédibilité de l'appelante en raison des photos de son compte Facebook \n",
      "[9] La SPR relève que dans son FDA, l'appelante a affirmé que ses enfants sont en colère après elle et refusent de la voir depuis le début de sa relation avec son ex-conjoint. Le ministre a déposé un avis d'intervention relatif à la crédibilité de l'appelante. Il soumet que l'appelante a déclaré dans son FDA être fâchée avec ses enfants à cause de sa relation avec son ex-conjoint. Il dépose une série de photos trouvées sur le Facebook public de l'appelante sur lesquelles on peut la voir avec ses enfants dans une atmosphère qui semble harmonieuse. Le ministre conclut que l'appelante a cherché à tromper la SPR et que si cet aspect de sa demande est fallacieux, il y a lieu de s'interroger sur la véracité de ses propos entourant son ex-conjoint, et même l'existence de ce dernier. Le ministre soumet que \" la SPR est en droit d'évaluer la crédibilité d'un demandeur en se fondant sur une seule contradiction, quand la preuve contestée est un aspect important de la demande2. \" La SPR n'accepte pas les explications de l'appelante, selon lesquelles elle ne voyait ses enfants que pendant des fêtes familiales et qu'à cette occasion, elle prenait des photos qu'elle publiait sur Facebook. La SPR en tire une inférence négative sur la crédibilité de l'appelante, que son témoignage n'est pas digne de foi et qu'elle n'a pas établi que ses enfants sont en colère envers elle. \n",
      "[10] L'appelante soumet que la SPR doit faire preuve de circonspection en formulant une conclusion d'absence de crédibilité. Elle allègue que la SPR fonde sa conclusion de manque de crédibilité sur le fait qu'elle semble avoir une relation avec ses fils alors qu'elle prétend que ceux-ci sont fâchés contre elle. Elle estime que cet élément n'est pas essentiel dans son histoire, et que les éléments importants de son récit concernent la persécution qu'elle a subie de la part de son ex-conjoint, puisque c'est la raison principale qui motive sa fuite de son pays. Elle ajoute que la SPR aurait dû examiner l'ensemble de son témoignage pour évaluer le danger qu'elle pourrait subir si elle devait retourner au Mexique. L'appelante prétend que son témoignage et son FDA sont clairs relativement à la persécution subie et ajoute que son témoignage était spontané, et qu'elle a donné des explications claires aux questions qui lui étaient posées. \n",
      "[11] La SPR a erré en basant principalement ses conclusions sur la relation de l'appelante avec ses fils. \n",
      "[12] La SPR devait traiter la question de la contradiction entre le FDA de l'appelante et les photos de son profil Facebook, notamment pour répondre à l'intervention du ministre. Toutefois, cette question n'est pas au cœur de la demande de l'appelante. L'appelante allègue qu'elle était victime de harcèlement psychologique de la part de son ex-conjoint. Ce sont ces allégations qui sont au cœur de sa demande et qui n'ont pas été évaluées par la SPR. Dans ses motifs, la SPR a traité essentiellement de la relation de l'appelante avec ses fils3, ce qui constitue un examen sélectif de la demande. Même si l'appelante avait tenté d'embellir son récit avec l'histoire de la brouille avec ses enfants, la SPR aurait dû traiter des allégations de harcèlement et analyser l'ensemble de la preuve. \n",
      "[13] Dans son intervention, le ministre soumet que la SPR peut rejeter une demande en se fondant sur une seule contradiction. Toutefois, pour que la SPR rejette une demande sur une seule contradiction, ladite contradiction doit être sur un aspect important de la demande. Ici, même si l'appelante avait tenté d'embellir sa demande, le fait qu'elle soit fâchée avec ses enfants à cause de sa relation avec l'agent de persécution n'est pas important. Au mieux, c'est une contradiction qui pourrait s'ajouter à d'autres contradictions, omissions ou incohérence sur des éléments importants de la demande, mais je ne suis pas d'accord que cette contradiction est importante.    \n",
      "[14] L'appelante estime qu'elle a donné une explication raisonnable en ce qui a trait aux incertitudes quant à l'état de la relation avec ses fils. En l'occurrence, elle a expliqué que bien que ses fils soient fâchés contre elle, ils sont tout de même invités à tous les événements familiaux, et se retrouvent donc aux mêmes événements que l'appelante. Elle croit qu'il est raisonnable de prendre des photos avec des membres de sa famille lors de tels événements. \n",
      "[15] La SPR a erré en considérant que l'appelante a menti dans son FDA sur sa relation avec ses enfants et en tirant une inférence négative sur sa crédibilité. La SPR a questionné l'appelante sur chacune des photos de son profil Facebook, cherchant à savoir quand ces photos ont été prises et dans quelles circonstances. L'appelante a clairement expliqué, de façon claire et constante, que sa famille (sœurs, frères, mère) se rencontre à chacune des fêtes significatives du calendrier et à l'anniversaire de sa mère. Ses deux enfants sont alors présents. \n",
      "[16] La SPR estime qu'il est rare que des personnes fâchées se rencontrent autant de fois, même dans un contexte familial, et que les photos donnent une impression générale du bonheur. L'appelante reconnaît que sur les photos, on peut la voir sourire, et ses fils aussi, ce que j'ai effectivement constaté. Toutefois, elle explique être malheureuse de sa mauvaise relation avec ses enfants et qu'elle profite de chacune des occasions pour leur demander de poser avec elle. Je crois cette explication. Personne ne peut dire ce qui se cache derrière le sourire sur une photo, ni ce qui se passe avant ou après que l'instant ait été figé dans le temps. \n",
      "[17] La SPR l'a également confrontée sur les dates de publication des photos qui sont éloignées des dates des fêtes et autres événements. Elle estime que la date de publication des photos ne correspond pas à des dates de fête. L'appelante a expliqué qu'elle recevait parfois les photos après les fêtes et que la date de publication ne correspond pas forcément à la date de prise de photo. Je suis d'accord avec l'appelante. Je la crois quand elle affirme qu'une photo prise à Noël a pu être publiée en mars, rien dans la preuve ne permet de conclure le contraire. Une date de publication sur les réseaux sociaux d'une photo ne donne aucune information sur la prise de ladite photo. \n",
      "[18] Dans son affidavit, le fils de l'appelante a écrit que sa mère s'est mariée avec son ex-conjoint contre la volonté de son frère et lui-même, en 2008 ou 2009. Il dit qu'après la séparation, ils se sont peu vus. Ni l'appelante ni son fils n'affirment qu'ils étaient totalement fâchés. Même si les photos sur Facebook ont été publiées après certaines dates de fête, cela ne mine pas la crédibilité de l'appelante. \n",
      "[19] Je crois les explications de l'appelante et je ne tire aucune inférence négative sur sa crédibilité relativement aux photos tirées de Facebook par le ministre.\n",
      "L'appelante a omis de signaler l'agression de son fils dans son FDA sans que cela affecte sa crédibilité considérant les circonstances spécifiques de l'omission\n",
      "[20] La SPR a relevé deux omissions importantes en lien avec le témoignage écrit de son fils XXXX (Affidavit). Ce dernier a témoigné dans sa déclaration écrite que l'ex-conjoint l'a d'abord menacé puis tabassé, entraînant une hospitalisation en octobre et novembre 2018. Or, la SPR constate que ces incidents ne figurent pas au FDA de l'appelante, mais qu'elle en a témoigné à l'audience. La SPR n'accepte pas l'explication de l'appelante qui s'est excusée et a affirmé avoir cru que la soumission de l'affidavit de son fils serait suffisante. Elle souligne que l'appelante n'a pas modifié son FDA en début d'audience et a confirmé que tout était complet et exact. Elle estime que ces omissions sont importantes et anéantissent la crédibilité de l'appelante.\n",
      "[21] L'appelante considère que la SPR a erré en tirant une inférence négative quant à sa crédibilité en lien avec l'omission dans son FDA de l'attaque de son fils par son ex-conjoint.  Elle précise qu'elle n'a pas voulu tromper le tribunal, mais qu'elle croyait que le dépôt de l'affidavit de son fils sur le même sujet serait suffisant.\n",
      "[22] Le dernier paragraphe des motifs traite de l'omission de l'agression de son fils dans le FDA de l'appelante. Ce témoignage est pertinent puisque le fait que l'agent de persécution s'en prenne à son fils après son départ est un élément important dans l'analyse de la motivation de l'agent de persécution, un élément en lien avec le risque prospectif. \n",
      "[23] La SPR a erré en tirant une inférence négative de l'omission de l'agression de son fils dans son FDA. L'appelante a quitté le Mexique en XXXX 2018. Son fils témoigne par écrit que l'ex-conjoint l'a agressé deux fois, en octobre et la seconde en novembre, sans préciser les dates exactes. L'appelante a signé son FDA le 1er novembre 2018. Les événements concernant son fils se sont produits entre son arrivée au Canada et la signature de son FDA. Elle n'a pas expliqué à l'audience si elle a appris les agressions avant ou après la rédaction de son FDA. Pour cette raison, je ne tire pas d'inférence négative du fait qu'elle n'a pas déclaré l'agression de son fils dans son FDA. \n",
      "[24] Pour ce qui est d'une modification au FDA, elle explique que, comme elle déposait l'affidavit à l'audience, elle croyait que cela serait suffisant et s'excuse de ne pas avoir modifié son FDA en début d'audience. Considérant que l'appelante a déposé l'affidavit à l'audience et qu'elle a donné spontanément son explication en début d'audience, et bien qu'elle aurait dû modifier son FDA, je ne tire pas d'inférence négative sur sa crédibilité. J'ai considéré les circonstances particulières du dépôt de l'affidavit, puisqu'elle l'a déposé à l'audience. Je crois l'appelante lorsqu'elle dit qu'elle pensait que cela allait être suffisant. Même si je considérais cette omission, elle ne serait pas une omission importante.  \n",
      "[25] L'appelante a juré que les faits au dossier sont véridiques, complets et exacts. Ses allégations sont donc présumées vraies, sauf s'il existe une raison valable d'en douter en évaluant la preuve selon la norme de la prépondérance des probabilités4. En l'espèce, la SPR a erré dans ses conclusions sur la crédibilité de l'appelante. La SAR n'a pas relevé suffisamment d'éléments qui, considérés cumulativement, permettent de conclure que la crédibilité de l'appelante sur les éléments essentiels de sa demande d'asile en est irrémédiablement affectée. \n",
      "Si l'appelante retourne au Mexique, elle ferait face à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution par son ex-conjoint. \n",
      "Les allégations de violence dans le FDA et à l'audience\n",
      "[26] L'appelante allègue dans son FDA qu'elle a rencontré son ex-conjoint en 2008, un homme d'affaires aisé qui a beaucoup d'influence auprès du gouvernement mexicain et dont la famille a toujours été protégée par les politiciens partout au pays. Après un certain temps, il est devenu agressif, grossier et arrogant. Il criait quotidiennement sur l'appelante, consommait de la pornographie et lui prenait son argent. L'appelante a demandé plusieurs fois à l'homme de partir, a changé ses serrures et a demandé de l'aide à la police. Il soudoyait le personnel pour entrer dans la maison et faisait pression sur la police. Le 23 janvier 2009, la relation a pris fin quand l'homme a trouvé sa \" femme de rêve. \" Alors que l'appelante avait déménagé, elle rencontre l'homme le 4 janvier 2018, alors qu'elle était dans un restaurant. Le lendemain, il s'est rendu chez l'appelante et l'a relancée en disant qu'il avait changé. À partir de cette journée, l'homme l'a surveillée, suivie pendant dix jours en accostant ses amies et ses clientes. L'appelante a voulu rapporter les incidents au ministère public qui a expliqué ne pas pouvoir intervenir, car les agressions étaient psychologiques et non physiques. L'appelante est ensuite partie dans l'état de Mexico chez sa tante, où l'homme l'a suivie. Elle explique que l'homme est ingénieur en informatique, ce qui lui donne des moyens pour la retrouver. Pendant qu'elle séjournait chez sa tante, cette dernière a eu deux accidents de voiture. L'appelante a fait plusieurs plaintes sans succès. L'appelante retourne en février chez elle à Aguascalientes. L'homme est venu chez elle la nuit en criant. Elle appelle de nouveau la police sans suite. Elle allègue qu'à cause de l'homme, elle a perdu ses clientes. En mars 2018, elle déménage chez sa mère à Zapopan (Jalisco). L'homme l'a suivie de nouveau, a menacé sa mère et ses enfants. Il a pris le bras de l'appelante. La police est arrivée, l'homme a été détenu, mais fut libéré. L'appelante a alors reçu un avertissement parce qu'elle aurait fait de fausses déclarations. Elle décide alors de ne plus sortir. La voiture de sa mère a été emboutie et l'homme venait frapper à la porte la nuit. L'appelante a cherché de nouveau la protection de la police, sans succès. En avril, l'appelante retourne chez elle. L'homme n'a pas cessé de la suivre pendant quatre mois et demi. En septembre, l'appelante décide de quitter le pays.\n",
      "[27] En début d'audience, l'appelante a ajouté des allégations selon lesquelles l'homme a tenté de la prostituer en juin 2008. Elle a expliqué qu'elle ne les avait pas incluses dans son FDA parce qu'elle avait honte. \n",
      "L'appelante a établi que la violence, vécue ou redoutée, constitue une grave violation de ses droits fondamentaux de la personne \n",
      "[28] L'appelante craint d'être persécutée en raison de son sexe par son ex-conjoint. Mon analyse sur les motifs de persécution est réalisée à la lumière des Directives no 4 du Président relatives aux revendicatrices du statut de réfugié craignant d'être persécutées en raison de leur sexe (Directives)5. \n",
      "[29] L'appelante a soumis que pour déterminer si la violence sexuelle ou familiale (lesquelles peuvent causer des dommages mentaux et physiques) constitue des formes de torture ou de traitements cruel, inhumain ou dégradant équivalent à de la persécution, les décideurs doivent examiner la définition de torture dans la Convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou dégradants6. \n",
      "[30] L'appelante a raison. Selon les Directives, les circonstances qui font naître chez les femmes une crainte de persécution sont souvent uniques aux femmes et la question à poser est de savoir si 1) la violence, vécue ou redoutée, constitue une grave violation du droit fondamental de la personne pour un motif de la Convention et 2) dans quelles circonstances on peut dire que le danger de cette violence résulte de l'absence de protection de l'État. Pour déterminer si la conduite de l'agent de persécution constitue de la persécution, les Directives recommandent de se tourner vers des instruments internationaux. \n",
      "[31] La violence psychologique et le harcèlement avec menaces peuvent être des éléments de la persécution7. La Cour fédérale a reconnu qu'il peut y avoir persécution, même s'il n'y a pas de mauvais traitements physiques8. L'article 2 de la Déclaration sur l'élimination de la violence contre les femmes9 énonce que la violence à l'égard des femmes s'entend comme englobant la violence physique, sexuelle et psychologique exercée au sein de la famille et de la collectivité. Dans son préambule, cette même déclaration affirme que \" la violence faite aux femmes constitue une violation des droits de la personne humaine et des libertés fondamentales et empêche partiellement ou totalement les femmes de jouir desdits droits et libertés, et préoccupée que ceux-ci ne soient pas protégés dans les cas de violence à l'égard des femmes. \"\n",
      "[32] Le témoignage de l'appelante était spontané. Elle a expliqué dans des mots clairs les différents événements vécus avec son ex-conjoint et j'ai conclu que son témoignage était crédible. Après avoir pris connaissance de son FDA et de son témoignage, j'ai constaté qu'en l'espèce, son ex-conjoint l'a harcelée au point de lui faire perdre ses clientes et de l'obliger à changer de travail, violant son droit à des conditions de travail équitables et satisfaisantes et à son droit à la liberté. Ce même droit à la liberté a été violé alors que l'homme contrôlait les faits et gestes de l'appelante, au point de la suivre dans plusieurs endroits, comme chez sa mère ou chez sa tante. L'appelante a tenté de porter plainte plusieurs fois, et les autorités lui ont répondu qu'elles n'étaient pas en mesure d'intervenir, car les violences subies n'étaient pas physiques. La violence de l'homme a escaladé puisque l'appelante a témoigné qu'il l'avait prise par le bras violemment au point qu'elle a dû crier. Par ailleurs, selon le témoignage écrit du fils de l'appelante, l'homme s'en est pris physiquement à lui, au point qu'il a dû être hospitalisé. \n",
      "L'appelante a établi la crainte prospective\n",
      "[33] L'appelante a établi qu'il y a une crainte prospective en raison de la volonté de son ex- conjoint de s'en prendre à elle. Elle a expliqué qu'il l'a déjà retrouvée alors qu'elle s'était réfugiée dans la Ville d'Atizapan. Il a les moyens de la retrouver parce qu'il est XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX et elle suspecte qu'il utilise ladite technologie et la localisation de ses appareils électroniques pour la retrouver. Il a démontré dans le passé que, même s'ils ne sont plus ensemble, il est toujours prêt à la harceler et même à s'attaquer physiquement à son fils, ce qui établit une possibilité sérieuse qu'il le fasse de nouveau aussitôt qu'il en aura la possibilité. Ainsi, la sécurité de l'appelante serait à risque dès que ce dernier saurait qu'elle est revenue au Mexique. Par ailleurs, l'ex-conjoint a beaucoup d'influence sur les autorités en raison du pouvoir politique de sa famille, ce qui accroît encore le risque de la retrouver où qu'elle se trouve dans le pays. \n",
      "[34] Après avoir évalué la preuve documentaire et pris en compte les Directives, ainsi que les instruments internationaux, je conclus que l'appelante a établi que la violence, vécue ou redoutée, constitue une grave violation du droit fondamental de la personne pour un motif de la Convention et que si elle retourne au Mexique, elle ferait face à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution par son ex-conjoint. \n",
      "Le Mexique ne pourrait pas assurer une protection adéquate à l'appelante\n",
      "[35]  L'appelante a fourni peu d'arguments relativement à la capacité de l'État de lui fournir une protection adéquate. Pour réfuter la présomption de protection de l'État, un demandeur d'asile doit fournir des éléments de preuve \" clairs et convaincants \" de l'incapacité de l'État d'assurer sa protection. Toutefois, j'ai procédé à une analyse détaillée de la preuve documentaire sur la protection que l'État mexicain offre aux femmes victimes de violence conjugale.  \n",
      "[36] La violence faite aux femmes est courante au Mexique, même si selon certaines sources, la situation évolue lentement grâce à l'effort de l'État mexicain10. Selon une enquête sur la dynamique des relations dans les ménages, 59% des femmes séparées, divorcées et veuves ont vécu des situations d'exploitation financière ou de violence psychologique, ou de violence physique ou sexuelle dans leur relation actuelle ou précédente11. D'après une organisation féministe mexicaine, 40,1% des femmes qui affirment avoir été victimes de violence conjugale dans leur relation précédente ont subi de la violence psychologique12. \n",
      "[37] Actuellement, surtout depuis la pandémie de COVID-19, les services et le soutien offert aux femmes victimes de violence conjugale sont mis à mal13. En pratique, le président mexicain Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador estime que la violence envers les femmes est le résultat de politiques néolibérales et a déclaré au sujet de l'augmentation observée de la violence conjugale durant la quarantaine que 90% des appels de femmes au 911 sont mensongers. Des sources signalent également une diminution du budget de l'Institut national des femmes et le financement public accordé aux organisations de la société civile a eu des conséquences négatives sur les refuges pour femmes victimes de violence conjugale. Même au plus haut niveau de l'État, la violence conjugale faite aux femmes n'est pas toujours reconnue.\n",
      "[38] L'article 343 du Code pénal fédéral prévoit des peines pour les auteurs de violence familiale14 :  \n",
      "Commet l'infraction de violence familiale quiconque se livre à des actes ou à des comportements de dominance, de contrôle, d'agression physique, psychologique, matérielle ou économique, que ce soit à l'intérieur ou à l'extérieur du foyer, contre toute personne avec qui il ou elle entretient une relation de mariage, de parenté, d'affinité, d'adoption ou de cohabitation, ou une relation de couple [mise en évidence ajoutée] \n",
      "et parmi les 32 états mexicains, 29 ont des lois comportant des peines similaires que celles prévues dans le Code fédéral. Selon plusieurs experts des Nations Unies, les lois en matière de violence envers les femmes ne s'avèrent pas efficaces et souvent, elles ne sont pas appliquées. Une professeure estime que les agents de l'État chargés de la mise en œuvre pratique de la loi ne prennent pas en considération la perspective de genre et n'ont pas d'engagement envers les femmes ou sont ouvertement misogynes. \n",
      "[39] Malgré l'existence d'une loi générale sur la violence faite aux femmes, sa mise en œuvre reste problématique. Même si des mesures de protection pour les femmes victimes de violence existent, celles-ci ne portent pas toujours plainte en raison du manque de confiance envers le système. Ces lacunes des mesures de protection prévues par la loi générale sont documentées dans le rapport au CEDAW et établissent clairement l'incapacité de l'État à protéger les femmes victimes de violence15. \n",
      "[40] L'appelante a demandé de l'aide à la police à plusieurs reprises. Elle n'a pu être aidée parce qu'on lui a répondu qu'elle n'avait pas subi de violence physique. Selon mon analyse de la preuve documentaire, bien que la violence psychologique soit considérée comme de la violence envers les femmes au Mexique, les autorités ne prennent pas toujours au sérieux les plaintes des femmes, surtout lorsque l'agresseur, comme l'ex-conjoint de l'appelante, possède une influence politique16. \n",
      "[41] Après avoir évalué la preuve documentaire et pris en compte les Directives, ainsi que les instruments internationaux, je conclus que le danger de la violence subie par l'appelante résulte de l'absence de protection de l'État. La preuve est claire et convaincante : si l'appelante s'adresse aux autorités, il est probable que la police ne ferait pas d'efforts raisonnablement sérieux pour la protéger et que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, la protection accordée par l'État mexicain serait inadéquate.\n",
      "L'appelante ferait face à un risque sérieux de persécution dans tout le pays \n",
      "[42] La SPR n'a pas traité de la PRI à l'audience. La SAR a proposé par un avis une PRI dans la ville de Mexico et celle de Mérida.\n",
      "[43] Le critère d'analyse d'une PRI comporte deux volets qui doivent chacun être établis pour qu'il soit possible de conclure à l'existence de ladite PRI, soit l'évaluation du risque de persécution dans la ville où il existe une PRI et celle du caractère raisonnable pour l'appelant de s'y installer compte tenu de ses circonstances particulières. Lorsque le premier volet est rempli, il n'est pas nécessaire d'examiner le second volet. \n",
      "[44] L'ex-conjoint et agent de persécution a la capacité de retrouver l'appelante. Elle explique qu'il l'a déjà retrouvée alors qu'elle s'était réfugiée dans la ville d'Atizapan. Elle ajoute qu'il est XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX et qu'il XXXX XXXX XXXX et la localisation des appareils électroniques pour pouvoir la retrouver. Cela indique que dès qu'il aura accès à son numéro de cellulaire, il aura la capacité de la retrouver. Le fait qu'il ait déjà cherché à la retrouver en s'attaquant à son fils augmente le risque qu'il mette la main sur son numéro de téléphone. Il a d'ailleurs démontré dans le passé qu'il était capable de le faire. L'ex-conjoint a également des accès à des policiers et des politiciens, comme cela a été établi par l'appelante alors qu'elle a expliqué comment il était capable de se sortir des plaintes et des appels à la police. La corruption des forces de police à tout niveau au Mexique est un problème sérieux, même si le gouvernement fait de la lutte contre la corruption sa principale priorité17. L'ex-conjoint de l'appelante pourrait soudoyer des policiers corrompus pour la retrouver, ce qui augmente encore sa capacité à la retrouver.\n",
      "[45] L'ex-conjoint a la motivation à retrouver l'appelante. L'appelante a établi qu'il a beaucoup d'influence sur les autorités en raison du pouvoir politique de sa famille, ce qui accroît encore le risque de la retrouver où qu'elle se trouve dans le pays. Il l'a démontré dans le passé quand il n'a eu de cesse de la harceler, même quand ils ne formaient plus un couple. Le fait qu'il ait attaqué son fils indique sa motivation à la retrouver.  \n",
      "[46] Ainsi, la sécurité de l'appelante serait à risque dès que ce dernier saurait qu'elle est revenue au Mexique. \n",
      "[47] Après analyse de la situation particulière de l'appelante et du profil spécifique de son agent de persécution, je conclus qu'il existe une possibilité sérieuse de persécution pour l'appelante dans tout le pays advenant son retour au Mexique et l'État ne pourrait lui assurer une protection adéquate. \n",
      "CONCLUSION\t\n",
      "[48] Il est fait droit à l'appel. Je substitue à la décision attaquée ma propre décision selon laquelle l'appelante a qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention. \n",

      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Principal Appellant), her husband, XXXX XXXX (the Associate Appellant), their XXXX XXXXyear-old daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Minor Female Appellant), and their XXXX-year-old son, XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Minor Male Appellant), are citizens of Nigeria. The Appellants allege a fear of persecution from the Associate Appellants family. Specifically, they allege that their agents of harm seek to force them to convert from Christianity to Islam and to engage in various customary rites, including Female Genital Mutilation or Cutting/Circumcision (FGM/C) of the Minor Female Appellant. They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting their claims for refugee protection. The Appellants argue that the RPD's finding that they have a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Port Harcourt is in error. They submit new evidence on appeal which they argue establishes that Port Harcourt is not a viable IFA. I have admitted some of the Appellants' proposed new evidence and I held a hearing on December 13, 2019. Having independently assessed the complete RPD Record, as well as the new evidence and RAD hearing testimony, I find that Port Harcourt is not a viable IFA. I have addressed why the RPD's IFA finding is no longer correct in light of the new evidence before providing my reasons for allowing the appeal and accepting the Appellants' claims.\n",
      "DECISION\t\n",
      "[2] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "The Appellants' allegations\n",
      "[3] The Appellants are from Lagos, Nigeria and they allege that their agents of harm belong to the Idowu royal family, based in XXXX, Ogun State. The Appellants allege that their problems began in XXXX 2015 when the Associate Appellant's mother demanded that the Minor Female Appellant undergo FGM/C upon her XXXX birthday. Both the Principal Appellant and Associate Appellant are opposed to FGM/C. They allege that their refusal was followed by a series of death threats and physical assaults. They further allege that they relocated from Lagos to Abuja, Kano, and Benin City but were located by their agents of harm. Finally, they allege that the agents of harm approached the Principal Appellant's brother in Abuja and the Principal Appellant's sister in Port Harcourt to inquire about their location. They allege a fear of persecution upon return to Nigeria based on their refusal to convert to Islam and engage in the demanded customary rites. \n",
      "The RPD's decision\n",
      "[4] The RPD heard the Appellants' claim over two sittings, held on August 8, 2018 and November 30, 2018. The RPD found that the Appellants were not credible about the power and influence of their agent of persecution. The Appellants omitted their agent of harm's alleged connections to the Nigerian customs authority and his businesses throughout Nigeria from their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and multiple amendments. However, the RPD did not make any negative credibility findings regarding the Appellants' alleged past persecution, including their location in four cities in Nigeria. The RPD also did not impugn the Appellants' allegation that they were sought through two family members, one of whom lives in the proposed IFA location. The RPD found that Port Harcourt would be a viable IFA if the Appellants do not reside with the Principal Appellant's sister. The RPD found that there is insufficient credible evidence that the Associate Appellants' family have the means to locate the Appellants in Port Harcourt. \n",
      "NEW EVIDENCE AND REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD) HEARING\n",
      "[5] The Appellants' claims were rejected on December 28, 2018. The Appellants did not include any new evidence with their February 25, 2019 Appeal Record to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). Instead, the Appellants submitted new evidence in seven separate post-perfection submissions between June 2019 and December 2019.1 Many of these items were provided in a disorganized fashion and duplicated multiple times in separate packages to the RAD. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have organized the proposed new evidence as follows:\n",
      "a. Reference in Counsel's covering letter to an item entitled \"disclosure that travel to Niger Delta is difficult\";\n",
      "b. An online article, Oyo still ranks high on FGM, dated October 5, 2017;\n",
      "c. Two print articles on the practice of FGM/C in Nigeria, dated February 7, 2017\n",
      "d. Nigerian travel advisories, dated April 26, 2019 and October 2, 2019;\n",
      "e. United Kingdom (UK) Home Office report, dated August 2019;\n",
      "f. Oasis Magazine article, dated January 29, 2019;\n",
      "g. This Day notice, dated February 7, 2019;\n",
      "h. Sharp Edge News article, dated September 5, 2019; \n",
      "i. Email and sworn statement from O.O.,2 dated October 7, 2019; and\n",
      "j. Emails from O.I., dated October 2, 2019 and October 3, 2019.\n",
      "[6] According to RAD Rule 29,3 evidence and submissions filed after the perfection of the appeal are not admissible unless I allow them into evidence. In making the decision of whether or not to allow the document, I must consider any relevant factor, including:\n",
      "i. Whether the document is relevant and probative; and\n",
      "ii. Whether the document brings any new evidence to the appeal; and \n",
      "iii. Whether the document could have been provided with reasonable effort with the Appeal Record. \n",
      "[7] If I accept evidence under RAD Rule 29, I must consider subsection 110(4) of the IRPA,4 which states that I can only accept evidence that:\n",
      "i. Arose after the RPD decision; or\n",
      "ii. Was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or \n",
      "iii. Could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been presented to the RPD before the decision.\n",
      "[8]  If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.5 According to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA,6 I may only hold an oral hearing where the accepted new evidence:\n",
      "i. Raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal; and\n",
      "ii. Is central to the decision of the claim; and\n",
      "iii. If accepted, justifies allowing or rejecting the claim.\n",
      "[9] If the new evidence meets each requirement I must decide whether to hold a hearing.\n",
      "[10]  I find that the evidence described in items (a), (b) and (c) is inadmissible. I find the evidence described in items (d) and (e) is admissible but does not require an oral hearing. I find that the evidence described in items (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) is admissible and requires an oral hearing. Counsel made a further application to call O.O., the author of the email and affidavit in item (i), as a witness. I granted this application and held a hearing on December 13, 2019.\n",
      "The evidence in items (a), (b), and (c) is inadmissible\n",
      "[11] In her October 7, 2019 package Counsel refers to an item entitled \"disclosure that travel to Niger Delta is difficult.\"7 She indicates that this item is \"Exhibit 10\" and that it appears at \"pages 141-144.\" No such document appears anywhere in this package or anywhere else in the Appellants' evidence. In accordance with Rule 27, each proposed piece of new evidence must be filed before the RAD. Item (a) is not properly before me and is therefore inadmissible.\n",
      "[12] The online article, Oyo still ranks high on FGM is dated October 5, 2017, over one year before the RPD's decision and nearly one and a half years before the date of the Appeal Record. This article is readily accessible online. Counsel has not explained how this article is new or could not have been provided with reasonable effort with the Appeal Record under Rule 29. Counsel has also not argued that this article was not reasonably available, or could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to be presented at the time of the RPD rejection. Item (b) is inadmissible.\n",
      "[13] The two articles in item (c) pre-date the perfection of the appeal. In addition, both of these articles repeat information about FGM/C, including its prevalence throughout Nigeria, which is already well documented in the Record. Neither document speaks to the IFA city of Port Harcourt. Item (c) is inadmissible.\n",
      "The evidence in items (d) and (e) is admitted but does not require a hearing\n",
      "[14] The Nigerian travel advisories and UK Home Office Report at items (d) and (e) are dated after the Appellants perfected their appeal. As such, they could not have been provided with the Appeal Record. They are also both relevant to the conditions in the proposed IFA and are new in that they speak to recent country conditions. These items meet the requirements of Rule 29. They also are dated after the RPD rejection and meet the requirements of 110(4). I further find that these documents are credible, relevant to the claim, and new. They are issued by the Canadian and UK governments and speak to recent country conditions. Items (d) and (e) are admitted into evidence. However, I do not find that these items require a hearing as they are not determinative the claim and they do not raise a serious issue as to the Appellants' credibility.\n",
      "The evidence in items (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) is admitted and I held a hearing\n",
      "[15] The Appellants provided two newspaper articles readily available online, as well as a print newspaper notice, at items (f), (g), and (h). These items have been published by This Day, Oasis Magazine, and Sharp Edge News. These items indicate that the Appellants' agents of harm remain interested in locating them in order to perform FGM/C and other customary rites. The articles include the Appellants' full names and photographs as well as threats from their agents of harm. This evidence, if credible, establishes that the Idowu royal family remains motivated to locate the Appellants and is willing and able to use the news media in their search. Items (i) and (j) corroborate the Appellants' allegations about how they learned about this evidence.\n",
      "[16] The evidence in items (f) and (g) pre-date the perfection of the appeal. However, Counsel argues that the Appellants only became aware of the existence of these articles in May 2019 after speaking with a friend and the Associate Appellant's brother in Nigeria and with O.O. during his visit to Canada. This is corroborated by the Appellants' appeal affidavit. As such, I find that these articles could not have been filed with reasonable effort by the Appellants in their Appeal Record. They are also both relevant and probative and bring new evidence to the appeal. These items meet the requirements of Rule 29. They are also dated after the RPD rejection and meet the requirements of 110(4). I further find that these documents are prima facie credible, relevant to the claim, and new. Item (f) is readily available online and the Board's Research Directorate located item (g) in the Daily News archives, confirming that this notice was published.8 \n",
      "[17] The evidence in items (h), (i), and (j) arose after the Appellants perfected their appeal. As such, they could not have been provided with the Appeal Record. They are also relevant, probative, and bring new evidence to the appeal. These items meet the requirements of Rule 29. Their contents arose after the RPD rejection and they meet the requirements of 110(4). I further find that these documents are prima facie credible, relevant to the claim, and new. Item (h) is an article readily available online and item (i) includes a sworn statement.\n",
      "[18] Items (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) are admitted into evidence. These items are central to the claim as they relate to the viability of the IFA location, in particular to the means and motivation of the agents of harm to locate the Appellants. I am mindful that information in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nigeria indicates that brown envelope journalism is practiced in Nigeria and that it is \"very common\" for \"ordinary citizens in Nigeria to bribe journalists to create or modify news stories.\"9 As such, this new evidence raises a serious issue as to the Appellants' credibility. Finally, these items, if accepted, are determinative of the viability of the IFA and justify allowing the Appellants' claim. If accepted, this new evidence demonstrates both the means and motivation of the agents of harm to locate the Appellants throughout Nigeria. As such, I held a hearing on December 13, 2019. This hearing was limited to the new evidence in items (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j). During the RAD hearing I did not have the jurisdiction to hear and test the credibility of evidence already presented to the RPD.\n",
      "[19] The Appellants' testimony at the RAD hearing was consistent with the new evidence presented on appeal. Their explanations for how they learned about the newspaper articles and notice was consistent with the timeline of the articles as well as the other supporting evidence filed, including emails 0and an affidavit. The Appellants testified under oath and in a consistent manner about the provenance of the three newspaper articles. They insist that they played no part in the publication of any of the three articles. Absent any reason to doubt the credibility of the Appellants' allegation, I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that they were not behind the publication of these articles. In addition, the testimony of the Appellants' witness, O.O., a sailor in the US navy, was also consistent and credible. He spoke in detail about discovering the notice in This Day and learning about the agents of harm and their continued interest in the Appellants during his recent trip to Nigeria. His testimony corroborates the Appellants' allegations that their agents of harm have the means and motivation to search from them in Nigeria. \n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[20] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.10 \n",
      "[21] Counsel's written submissions on appeal are often difficult to follow and misapprehend the very basis for the Appellants' appeal. For instance, Counsel writes: \"I urge the RAD to take a close look at the questioning of the [RPD] panel. It was detailed and required follow up answers and.\"11 The sentence is incomplete. It is unclear what Counsel's concern is with the RPD's questioning. Having undertaken my own independent assessment of the Record, I find that the RPD's questioning at the hearing was fair, thorough, and responsive to the Appellants' testimony. Moreover, Counsel argues that the \"Appellants had canvassed the issue of IFA at their refugee hearing and the RPD Panel took it off the table.\"12 This is incorrect on its face. The RPD rejected the Appellants' claims based on its finding that Port Harcourt is a viable IFA. The availability of an IFA was the only determinative issue and it was never \"taken off the table.\" \n",
      "[22] I have undertaken my own independent assessment of the entire Record. In light of the new evidence presented on appeal, I find that Port Harcourt is no longer a viable IFA. \n",
      "The Appellants do not have a viable IFA in Port Harcourt in light of the new evidence\n",
      "[23] The RPD correctly set out the two-prongs of the IFA test. After engaging in a thorough analysis that is responsive to the Appellants' particular circumstances, the RPD found that Port Harcourt is a viable IFA. Having independently assessed the evidence, I find that the IFA location fails on the first prong in light of the new evidence. I find that the Appellants do not have a viable IFA.\n",
      "[24] The Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) released a Jurisprudential Guide (JG) regarding IFA locations in major cities in south and central Nigeria for Claimants fleeing non-state actors.13 The RPD correctly considered and applied the JG in its analysis. Generally, pursuant to the JG, an IFA is available to Nigerians fleeing non-state actors. However, in my view, given the new evidence on appeal, there are circumstances in this case which bring the facts outside those of the JG. \n",
      "[25] Unlike in the JG, the Appellants before me have provided credible evidence that their agents of harm have undertaken significant and sustained efforts to locate them throughout Nigeria. These efforts have continued even after the Appellants fled Nigeria. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, the Appellants unchallenged allegation is that their agents of harm:\n",
      "i. Subjected them to a series of death threats and physical assaults throughout Nigeria, including in Lagos, Abuja, Kano, and Benin City;\n",
      "ii. Approached the Principal Appellant's brother in Abuja in order to enquire about their current location;\n",
      "iii. Approached the Principal Appellant's sister in Port Harcourt, the IFA location, in order to enquire about their current location; and\n",
      "iv. Utilized three separate news agencies to publish articles and notices in an attempt to locate the Appellants. \n",
      "[26] I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants' agents of harm possess both the means and motivation to locate the Appellants in Port Harcourt. Where the agents of harm have demonstrated the means and motivation to pursue their victims in multiple cities, including in the proposed IFA location, then the IFA is not viable. The Appellants need not establish that their agents of harm \"'would be able to find [them],\" but merely that they face a serious possibility of persecution.14 This is a low threshold. I find that the Appellants face a serious possibility of persecution on return to Nigeria and that they do not have a viable IFA.\n",
      "The Appellants' claim is well founded and they do not have access to state protection\n",
      "[27] The RPD did not decide on the issues of nexus, objective basis, and state protection. Having undertaken my own assessment of all of the evidence, I find that the Appellants have a nexus, that their claims are well-founded, and that they do not have access to operationally adequate state protection in Nigeria.\n",
      "The Appellants have a nexus to a Convention ground\n",
      "[28] All of the Appellants possess a nexus to a Convention ground based on their religion, through their objection to the performance of customary rites and forced religious conversion. The Minor Female Appellant also possesses a nexus to a Convention ground based on her particular social group, as a female child at risk of FGM/C. The Principal Appellant and Associate Appellant have also established derivative claims based on their particular social group, as the Minor Female Appellants' parents who object to the performance of FGM/C and fear persecution as a result.\n",
      "      The Appellants claims are well-founded\n",
      "[29] The objective evidence supports the well-foundedness of the Appellants' claims. The Board's research documents indicate that where both parents agree, \"nobody will walk into [somebody else's] home' to perform FGM on their daughters and that 'parents are free to refuse it.'\"15 However, while unusual, there is evidence in the NDP that family elders in Nigeria have kidnapped children to forcibly perform FGM/C, even where the parents of a minor child are not in support of the practice.16 The Appellants specifically testified about their fear that the Minor Appellants could be kidnapped by their agents of harm. There is evidence in the most recent NDP that family elders may forcibly perform FGM/C on female children without their parent's knowledge.17 There is also evidence in the NDP that parents who refuse the performance of FGM/C may be subjected to \"ostracism, stigmatisation and blackmailing, denial of intracultural benefits and physical abuse.\"18 The most recent NDP indicates that parents opposed to FGM/C could face \"persecution or serious harm\" where the act of FGM/C is enforced on a child.19 I find that the Appellants' claims are objectively well founded and that they face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Nigeria.\n",
      "The Appellants do not have access to operationally adequate state protection\n",
      "[30] The Appellants allege that they sought police protection multiple times in Nigeria but were told by authorities that their concerns are 'domestic in nature' and that they should abide by family traditions. The NDP corroborates the Appellants' allegation that police are reluctant to intervene in 'family matters.' Persons fleeing ritual practices may face discrimination in accessing police protection as the police may be reluctant to interfere with custodians of cultural rites in Nigeria and unwilling to provide protection.20 There are serious deficiencies in state protection for victims of customary rites in Nigeria. \n",
      "[31] While FGM/C is criminalized in Nigerian federal law, through the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Act and state legislation, there has been no institutional response to the practice of FGM/C from either the Nigeria police or the Nigerian state; the law is not effectively enforced and FGM/C is considered a private matter.21 Indeed, \"until the completion of the legislative process within the 36 Nigerian states, the [VAPP] Act 'is a mere paper document outside the Federal Capital Territory [FCT].'\"22 Following the VAPP, the Nigerian government \"took no legal action to curb the practice\" and beyond public awareness campaigns, \"evidence of [the VAPP's] enforcement since it came into force has not yet emerged.\"23 Implementation of the VAPP is \"uneven\" and \"[m]ost likely, police will also consider it a family affair and refuse to interfere.\"24 The most recent NDP indicates that \"it remains extremely difficult for women and girls to obtain protection from FGM.\"25 The \"practice of FGM 'continues to thrive' and several thousand girls and women are subjected to the practice despite its illegality.\"26\n",
      "[32] While some efforts have been made to address FGM/C and the forcible performance of customary rites, the documentary evidence suggests that these efforts have not translated into state protection at the operational level. I find that the Appellants do not have access to operationally adequate state protection in Nigeria.\n",
      "CONCLUSION \n",
      "[33] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.27\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW \n",
      "[1] I allow this appeal. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Co-Appellant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Minor Appellants) are appealing a decision of the RPD. The Principal and Minor Appellants are citizens of the Dominican Republic. The Minor Appellants along with their mother, the Co-Appellant, are also citizens of Costa Rica.\n",
      "a. The Appellants fear the nephew of a powerful drug trafficker who is pursuing the affections of the Co-Appellant. The Appellants affirm that the nephew has pursued the Co-Appellant between 2015 and 2020 by addressing her directly and also through threats, harassment and a kidnapping attempt directed at the Principal Appellant. The Appellants left the Dominican Republic and entered Canada on a valid visitor's visa in XXXX 2018, before requesting asylum in March 2019.\n",
      "b. The RPD found that the Appellants were not credible about the kidnapping and attack on the Principal Appellant that occurred in March 2017. It found that the Principal Appellant could return to the Dominican Republic and that the Co-Appellant and the Minor Appellants could find refuge in Costa Rica. The Appellants argue that the RPD dismissed the documentary evidence before it without clear and reasonable basis and assessed the credibility of their claim in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of natural justice.\n",
      "c. The determinative issues for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) are credibility and natural justice.\n",
      "d. The RPD erred when it failed to consider the gender-related aspects in this case in its assessment of whether there is nexus to the Convention. It also erred when it failed to consider the credibility of the Appellants' testimony within the context of the documentary evidence on violence against women, police corruption, and the drug trafficking problem in the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. For these reasons, I find that the RPD did not respect the principles of natural justice and the rules of procedural fairness because it did not respect its duty to consider all of the evidence.\n",
      "DECISION\n",
      "[2] The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined.\n",
      "NEW EVIDENCE\n",
      "The evidence presented by the Appellants is accepted\n",
      "[3] The Appellants are requesting that the RAD admit new evidence in the form of a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the Dominican Republic. The letter is accompanied by a copy of the Bishop's national identity and voter's card. In the letter, the Bishop indicates that in March 2017, he received a call from the Co-Appellant who told him that something had happened to the Principal Appellant. He indicates that the Co-Appellant attempted to call the Principal Appellant without success, leading him to look for the Principal Appellant in the neighborhood. He indicates that he later spoke to the Principal Appellant who recounted to him the details of the kidnapping, assault, and theft that he professes to have suffered in his asylum claim. He explains that he accompanied the Principal Appellant to the police station to file a report, and that he remained a source of support for them when they moved to a different residence until they decided to leave the country.\n",
      "[4] According to the law,1 I can only accept evidence that:\n",
      "i. arose after the RPD decision; or\n",
      "ii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or \n",
      "iii. that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n",
      "[5] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.2\n",
      "[6] I find that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring this letter to the RPD before the decision. The Appellants had already presented several affidavits to the RPD in order to corroborate their claims, including the event that took place in March 2017. They could not have anticipated that further corroborating evidence would be necessary to establish the credibility of that event, given that they provided credible and uncontradicted testimony to the RPD. I have no issues with the credibility of this evidence. I consider the evidence to be new in that it contradicts a finding of fact made by the RPD - that the March 2017 attack on the Principal Appellant did not occur. And it is relevant because the March 2017 attack on the Principal Appellant is relevant to the request for protection.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[7] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.3\n",
      "Natural Justice and Credibility\n",
      "[8] The Appellants argue that the RPD incorrectly assessed the credibility of their claim in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n",
      "     The fact that more than trying to understand their specific case, the member dismissed the documentary evidence without any clear and reasonable basis makes this decision flawed in law and procedure since it seems to have been made just to support the arguments for his negative decision which in this case was procedurally wrong and unfair.4\n",
      "[9] As a remedy, they have requested that the RAD return their case to the RPD for redetermination by a different panel. I am granting their request for redetermination for the reasons that follow.\n",
      "[10] One of the determinative errors made by the RPD is its failure to find that there was nexus to the Convention and its failure to consider Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution in its decision. The Co-Appellant has affirmed that she has been the target of unwanted attention by the nephew of a well-known Dominican drug lord for several years. There is an affirmation on the record that this nephew's motivation is his insistence that the Co-Appellant return his affection against her will. They assert that this desire intensified between 2015 and 2018 and extends into the realm of a forward-facing risk. The objective evidence lends credence to the fact that women may be at risk in the Dominican Republic for reasons related to their gender. The objective evidence indicates that femicide is a \"huge problem\" and that international organisations have questioned recent statistics indicating a decline in the number of femicides.5 Intimate partner violence against women is also a problem in the Dominican Republic,6 with further objective evidence indicating that high levels of violence persist against women in the Dominican Republic, that sexual harassment is an ongoing problem and that \"violence against women and girls is a major expression of power and control within the family and society.\"7 Issues with violence and against women are also present in the objective evidence for Costa Rica.8\n",
      "[11] At the heart of the claim is the Co-Appellant's affirmation that she is being harassed by a powerful man who refuses to accept that she is not interested in him. The sole reason that the Principal Appellant claims to have been harmed is this person's interest in his wife. The narrative being presented is one of a cycle of power and control where a powerful man insists upon receiving the affections of a woman who has clearly indicated that she does not consent to offer that affection. The interactions over the future of the Co-Appellant's own romantic relationships occur between the two men involved in the dispute, the powerful man who is the nephew of a drug lord and her husband. The Appellants find themselves in this situation because the Co-Appellant is a woman whose agency is being challenged by a man. I find that this context creates nexus to the Convention because the Co-Appellant is part of a particular social group by way of her gender, thus placing her family members at risk for the same reason. The Appellants' credibility, their access to adequate state protection, and the possibility of an internal flight alternative must be assessed through this lens and by applying the proper standard of proof. The same consideration must occur for the Co-Appellant and Minor Appellants in Costa Rica.\n",
      "[12] The other determinative error is its failure to consider the Appellants' testimony within the context of the objective evidence on the situation of violence against cisgender women, police and judiciary corruption, and the drug trafficking problem in the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. This error is present in the RPD's reasoning for its main credibility finding, where it did not consider all of the evidence before it. \n",
      "[13] Based upon an omission of details in the two police reports that the Appellants submitted, the RPD disregarded the credibility of the Principal Appellant's assertion that he was kidnapped and threatened by the drug trafficker's nephew in March 2017. The police reports do not indicate that the drug trafficker's nephew threatened the Principal Appellant or that he was involved in the kidnapping. The RPD found that the Principal Appellant failed to explain why the police would omit critical details from a complaint following a March 2017 attack. For this reason, it concluded that the attack did not take place and that that they had fabricated elements of their testimony and the letter from the friend to bolster their claim.  \n",
      "     As this does not adequately explain the omission and inconsistencies, I draw a negative inference regarding the principal claimant's credibility and - insofar as she is complicit with this aspect of their shared testimony - the associate claimant as well. I find that they are unreliable historians and I disregard these elements of their testimony, as well as the supporting letter from [their friend] that supports these elements, regarding the alleged kidnapping and its alleged concealment by police. I find that the elements of their testimony and the letter from [their friend] to be fabrication aimed at bolstering the claim.\n",
      "     The effect this has on their claims is that I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the alleged attack of March 2017 did not take place. Although I accept that the principal claimant was mugged and robbed as depicted in the two police reports submitted into evidence in an incident of common criminality, I find the allegation that XXXX was involved, that XXXX agents kidnapped the principal claimant, that they discharged a firearm, and that the police were bribed by XXXX afterwards to conceal XXXX involvement to be a fabrication.9\n",
      "[14] The RPD's analysis related to nexus, and the Appellants' prospective risk in Costa Rica and in the Dominican Republic are anchored in this negative credibility finding.\n",
      "[15] I find that the RPD conducted a microscopic and overzealous analysis of the Appellants' credibility and testimony. Here, I find it important to cite the affidavit that the Principal Appellant submitted with his memorandum of appeal. In this affidavit, the Principal Appellant details his disagreement and discontent with the RPD's assessment of his credibility.\n",
      "     That the judge is wrong when suggesting on paragraph 23 that the attack I suffered in March 2017 did not [happen] and that the involvement of XXXX on my [kidnapping] was a fabrication. This assumption is because I omitted some details in my narrative about it. I thought that the hearing was the time to give further details about all aspects of the claim. My written testimony was a \"summary of the events\" as I clearly mentioned in the very first paragraph of my narrative. So to say that because I missed some details, I am lying is not only offensive but also very illogical and unfair. I presented a summary and clearly stated what it was. I consider my testimony to have been honest and straightforward. If all the further details I testified about were going to be taken to undermine my credibility when I clearly stated that I was summarizing what had happened to us then I believe the hearing was only used to take things out of context and refuse my case. If any additional detail and my testimony was found not credible only because of details missing from the \"summary narrative\" then there is a very serious problem with the way the judge analyzes his cases. This definitely does not represent any kind of justice or fairness. It rather seems biased and mean.10\n",
      "[16] I find that the Principal Appellant has summarized in his own words the problem with relying heavily upon minor Basis of Claim form omissions or inconsistencies. Such a process unduly displaces the presumption of truth associated with an asylum-seeker's testimony as provided for in Maldonado11 which sets out the principal that when a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. The RPD must provide clear reasons for why the presumption of truth has been displaced. When the RPD displaces the presumption of truth for microscopic reasons, or when it appears to be searching for a contradiction or omission that does not truly exist, it creates the perception that the RPD did not have an open mind when it considered the case before it.  \n",
      "[17] In this case, the Principal Appellant asserts that in his narrative, he provided information relating to each of the events that he considered to be important. During the hearing, without being prompted or confronted by the RPD, the Principal Appellant explained that when he made his complaint to the police, he told them that the drug trafficker's nephew had threatened him, and that his vehicle and belongings were stolen. He explained that the next day, when he returned, the nephew's threats were not part of the complaint. I do not consider that the Principal Appellant omitted this information. He provided it openly and explained the situation in a clear, and credible manner. He was not confronted with the omission by the RPD prior to explaining why the threats do not appear in his complaint to the police.  \n",
      "[18] The Principal Appellant testified that it is known in the Dominican Republic that the police are corrupt as part of his explanation for why the police suppressed the information related to the drug trafficker's nephew from his complaint. The RPD characterized this and other related assertions as speculation. However, the objective evidence that was available to the RPD when it issued its decision supports the Appellants' characterization of police corruption in the Dominican Republic.\n",
      "[19] The objective evidence indicates that in the Dominican Republic, the police and military are involved in organized crime and drug trafficking. It states that this problem is intensified by state corruption, and that the issues with organized crime worsened between February 2017 and January 2019.12 Sources consulted by the Board indicate that the involvement of police in organized crime is well-known and is acknowledged by a majority of the population.13 The police in the Dominican Republic is said to be one of the least trusted state institutions.14\n",
      "[20] If information that is openly provided to the RPD and which is supported by the objective evidence results in a negative credibility finding leading to the displacement of the presumption of truth, then the bar set to determine what is credible is raised beyond that of a balance of probabilities.  \n",
      "[21] Moreover, it was an error for the RPD to use this finding to do away with the Co-Appellant's credibility. In her BOC, the Co-Appellant indicated that she is sure that the police cannot protect them because many of the authorities are involved with the drug lords.15 If the RPD considered the information provided in the BOC to be of particular importance, it should have considered the evidence provided by the Co-Appellant in her BOC before concluding that an omission occurred. The RPD erred by detracting from her credibility due to an omission that she did not make.\n",
      "[22] The aforementioned errors are enough for me to find that the RPD incorrectly assessed the Appellants' credibility. I find that the RPD did not respect its requirement to consider all of the relevant evidence before it and that this is a breach of the principles of natural justice and the rules of procedural fairness. For this reason, I will not go on to address the Appellants' remaining arguments.\n",
      "CONCLUSION \n",
      "[23] The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined.\n",
      "DIRECTIONS TO THE RPD\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of Venezuela. She is challenging a decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), rendered orally, on June 19, 2018,1 rejecting her refugee protection claim. Ms. XXXX XXXX is the daughter of a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Venezuelan XXXX XXXX, who also worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX,2 and is a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.3 She alleges fearing that she would be physically harmed, or killed if she were to return to Venezuela, by pro-opposition elements who are enemies of her father in the Venezuelan police, the government or the wider Venezuelan public, due to her father's political position and affiliations.4\n",
      "[2] Ms. XXXX XXXX left Venezuela on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 to the Dominican Republic.5 She then arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017,6 after having obtained a Canadian visitor visa she had applied at the Canadian consulate in Mexico.7 She filed her refugee protection claim on May 12, 2017.8\n",
      "[3] In its decision, the RPD concluded that there is independent documentary evidence that she is the daughter of this XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.9 However, the panel also found that the Appellant failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection with clear and convincing evidence. In this regard, the panel found that this failure was determinative of her claim under both section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), and rejected it.10 Furthermore, the RPD made several negative inferences, due to inconsistency in the Appellant's evidence, particularly with respect to the addresses that she listed in her Basis of Claim form (BOC), and her failure to mention that her father's objection to her departure from Venezuela as a reason for her delayed departure from Venezuela. 11\n",
      "[4] On appeal, Ms. XXXX XXXX submits that the RPD's state protection analysis was unreasonable;12 because it failed to appreciate that the agents of the state are the agents of persecution.13 Secondly, she submits that the RPD's analysis focused on whether the authorities were motivated to provide her with protection, given the Appellant's pro-government involvement, and not on the operational adequacy of protection.14 Thirdly, she alleges that the RPD's decision was illogical and internally inconsistent, because it disregarded the Appellant's allegation that her family was advised by the regime itself that it is unable to provide protection to them and that she feared the police itself.15 Fourthly, she submits that the documentary evidence underscores that regime change is likely in Venezuela, thereby contradicting the RPD's findings that the government in power will be able to provide protection to the Appellant.16 Lastly, she submits on appeal that the RPD's state protection analysis undermines the logic of refugee determination by suggesting that claimants have a chance of survival by making use of corrupt connections with an authoritarian regime.17\n",
      "[5] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) in this appeal is the state protection\n",
      "DECISION\n",
      "[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n",
      "BACKGROUND \n",
      "[7] According to Ms. XXXX XXXX, in 2006, she began being bullied by students and staff in school, because of the position that her father occupied with a government organization called MERCAL. The Appellant also alleges that her father received a note from an organization in XXXX, Miranda State (where they resided) informing him that his common-law partner (the Appellant's mother); and his children are being closely watched.18 When in XXXX 2008, a note and a call from unidentified persons were received by the Appellant's mother, informing her that they would die if they remained there, the Appellant together with her mother and brother moved to Caracas.19 According to Ms. XXXX XXXX, she continued to be bullied at school by classmates and teachers for her father's governmental position, and that her parents received phone calls from unknown individuals that his family members were being watched.20\n",
      "[8] From XXXX-XXXX 2015, they briefly moved back to XXXX XXXX in Bolivar State (where she was born), before returning to Caracas, after her mother allegedly received pictures on her mobile phone of her son playing in the neighborhood from an unknown number.21\n",
      "[9] In 2016, the Appellant alleges that she began receiving texts from individuals that they knew who she was. She also alleges that she always felt watched. During the summer of that year, a waitress in a mall made a comment implying she knew who she was, which made her feel threatened and unsafe.22\n",
      "[10] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, a colleague of the Appellant's father (XXXX XXXX) was shot and killed in-front of the Appellant's family apartment building in Caracas, allegedly by a police officer from a location where the opposition party is influential.23 On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, her half-brother was allegedly kidnapped by police officers who were sympathetic to the opposition. However, he was later located and brought home by the Appellant's father and his bodyguard.24\n",
      "[11] According to the Appellant, following her departure from Venezuela, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, two individuals shot the driver of one of the family cars in the chest, in which her brother was riding and stole the car.25\n",
      "NEW EVIDENCE\n",
      "[12] According to the law,26 I can only accept evidence that (i) arose after the RPD's decision; or (ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or (iii) that could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to be brought by the Appellant to the RPD before the decision in line with subsection 110(4) of IRPA. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant per the Raza/Singh factors before I can accept it.27\n",
      "[13] If the person subject to the appeal wants to use a document or a written submission that he/she did not provide with his/her record, the RAD in deciding whether to allow the application must consider any relevant factors, including: (i) the document's relevance and probative value; (ii) any new evidence that the document brings to the appeal and (iii) whether the person could have provided the document or written submission with the appellant's record, respondent's record or reply record.28 Furthermore, the person must make an application to the division in accordance with rule 37, including that it must be made in writing and without delay.29 \n",

      "1. Documents which the Appellant requests that they are admitted as new evidence\n",
      "[14] As new evidence, Ms. XXXX XXXX has submitted the following documents:\n",

      "[15] In June 2020, I disclosed to the Appellant that I will be relying on the updated version of the NDP for Venezuela (March 31, 2020) and invited submissions if she had any with respect to the determinative issue. On July 19, 2020, the Appellant made further submissions in response to my disclosure and which consisted of the following documents:\n",
      "* Additional Exhibit A: affidavit by the Appellant's mother (dated XXXX XXXX, 2020) attesting that from XXXX 2019-XXXX 2020, she has been extorted by three men who had entered her store, to pay XXXX US dollars/month, and that failure to do so would result in her getting killed. She also alleges that they also mentioned that she has the money to pay because she had a relationship with the Appellant's father 15 years ago.31\n",
      "* Additional Exhibit B-G: affidavits by three employees of the Appellant's mother at her business, (all the affidavits of which are dated XXXX XXXX, 2020) as well as translated copies of their workplace identification numbers attesting that they personally witnessed the Appellant's mother being the subject of threats and extortions at the business.32  \n",
      "* Additional Exhibit H-I: affidavit of the security guard on the night shift outside the residential building of the Appellant's mother (dated XXXX XXXX, 2020), and who allegedly witnessed the attack by two criminals on the Appellant's mother on XXXX XXXX, 2020 as well as a letter from the president of the Condominium's Board (not dated) confirming that he is employed as a security guard.33\n",

      "2. RAD Consideration \n",
      "a., Documents that I have accepted into evidence\n",
      "[16] With respect to Exhibit A, the document is one that Counsel had filed to the RPD on behalf of the Appellant. However, since it was submitted late and without an application (in contravention to the RPD's rules),34 the RPD decided not to accept it. \n",
      "[17] According to rule 3(3)(c) of the RAD's rules, documents refused by the RPD, form part of the record before the RAD. Hence, this exhibit does not undergo an analysis under subsection 110(4) of IRPA. Rather, I have to determine whether the RPD erred in not admitting the document into evidence when it applied the criteria of rule 36 of the RPD's rules. Here I note that when considering whether to allow a party to use a document at the hearing, which it did not provide in accordance with rule 34, the RPD must consider the relevant factors: (a) the document's relevance and probative value (b) any new evidence which the document brings to the hearing (c) and whether the party with reasonable effort could have provided the document as required by rule 34.\n",
      "[18] I find that the RPD erred in not admitting the document. Although Council for the Appellant stated during the hearing that the document has minimal probative value,35 the document brings new evidence to the hearing. As for whether the party could have, with reasonable effort provided the document as required by rule 34, Counsel said it was provided to him after the 10-day deadline and acknowledged his tardiness in submitting it.36 I therefore admit it into evidence.\n",
      "[19]  With respect to the documents in Exhibit B, except for Exhibit B-(iv), they all arose after the RPD's rejection of the claim. They were also not reasonably available at the time of the decision and could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to be brought before the RPD before the rejection of the Appellant's claim. I therefore find that Exhibit B (i)-(iii) and (v) -(vii) fulfill the criteria under section 110(4) of IRPA, and that Exhibit B (iv), which arose before the RPD's decision, does not fulfill one or more of these criteria.\n",
      "[20] With respect to the Raza/Singh factors, I find that these documents are new, in that they on the face of it credible sources. They are also relevant, in that Maduro's grip on power is tenuous and hence, and that regime change in the future is entirely possible,37 as a way of supporting the Appellant's allegations that the Maduro regime will not be able to provide protection to the Appellant because of her perceived political alignment (through her father) to the government.38 They are also new, in that they make allege that there are new elements that contradict the RPD's state protection analysis. I therefore find that Exhibit B (i)-(iii) and (v)-(vii) fulfill the criteria stipulated by the Raza/Singh factors and admit them into evidence. \n",
      "[21] Concerning the additional exhibits (A-K) submitted by the Appellant after the appeal was perfected, I have considered first additional exhibits A-J and found that they are relevant and of probative value, since they allege that the Appellant's mother, is a similarly situated individual to the Appellant, and that she became the victim of several extortion events by a group of unknown men for her links to the Appellant's father. The media reports in additional exhibit K are also relevant and probative because they allege to demonstrate that the situation in Venezuela is changing or that the RPD's decision should not be afforded any deference because of the manner in which the RPD member adjudicated a previous refugee protection claim. All of these exhibits, I find, also bring new evidence to the appeal, and the person could have provided the document or written submission with the appellant's record, respondent's record or reply record. \n",
      "[22] However, I do not find that the Appellant made an application to submit those documents without delay. According to the Appellant's affidavit, the mother allegedly began first receiving threats of extortion in XXXX 2019. She only submitted these documents to the RAD in July 2020, on the ground that her mother only talked to her abut it on XXXX XXXX, 2020.39 Nevertheless, I have decided that to include them under rule 29 because of my consideration of the other criteria.\n",
      "[23]  I also find that they meet one or more criteria under subsection 110(4) of IRPA. They arose after the RPD's decision; were not reasonably available at the time of the decision; and could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to be brought by the Appellant to the RPD before the decision. \n",
      "[24] Moreover, I find that they also meet the criteria of credibility, relevance and newness under the Raza/Singh factors and admit them into evidence: they are credible, considering their source and circumstances in which they came into existence; they are relevant in the sense that they are capable of proving or disproving a fact that is relevant to the refugee protection claim, and they are new, in the sense that they are capable of proving the current state of affairs in the country or an event or circumstance that arose after the RPD or proving a fact that was unknown to the Appellant at the time of the RPD hearing. I therefore admit all of the additional exhibits A-K into evidence.\n",
      "Request for an Oral Hearing\n",
      "[25] Although the Appellant has not requested an oral hearing, given that she has submitted new evidence which I have admitted into evidence, I have to determine whether the RAD will hold an oral hearing. I do not find that the evidence she submitted, raises a serious issue with respect to her credibility; is central to the decision with respect to the refugee claim or, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. The RAD will therefore not hold an oral hearing.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[26] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.40  I find that the RPD was correct in its decision that the credibility findings in and by themselves, are not sufficient to render the Appellant not credible, and that it is the Appellant's failure to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection that is determinative of this claim. Hence, I will address the failure to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection first.41\n",
      "[27] The Appellant bears the evidentiary burden of adducing evidence, in the form of clear and convincing proof to the effect that state protection is, on a balance of probabilities, inadequate or non-existent. For the following reasons, I do not find that she has discharged of that burden.\n",
      "1. Has the Appellant rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection?\n",
      "[28] According to the Appellant, her father, Mr. XXXX, served in different military and governmental capacities, including as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,42 as XXXX XXXX,43 as XXXX XXXX XXXX,44 and as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.45 Given his political affiliations and position, Ms. XXXX XXXX testified that her father had many enemies, particularly amongst the police force,46 because this is common for government workers in Venezuela.47 Hence, she stated that the police and the government itself were the ones that she feared.48\n",
      "[29] In its decision, the RPD accepts Ms. XXXX XXXX allegations that her father probably had many enemies.49 This is because based on the documentary evidence submitted by the Appellant, there have been allegations that during his tenure as XXXX XXXX (2010-2013), there were calls in the XXXX XXXX to have the Appellant's father investigated for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.50 Hence, as the RPD underscores, \"it is reasonable to assume that some people will be unhappy with the father given these allegations against him.\"51\n",
      "[30] However, the panel also concluded that Ms. XXXX XXXX failed to rebut the presumption that there is, on a balance of probabilities, inadequate state protection for her, or that it was objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to seek this protection. According to the RPD, the onus is on the Appellant to approach the state for protection, which she has not discharged.52 In this regard, the RPD found that Ms. XXXX XXXX has demonstrated a subjective reluctance to engage protection of the state;53 and that her personalized evidence indicates that she would receive adequate state protection,54 including by way of the political connections of her father.55 Furthermore, the RPD found that there was not sufficient documentary evidence to corroborate her allegations that there is a personalized risk to her, because she is a family member of a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,56 or that the police and other government bodies have become opposition controlled, or are not focused on protecting the government and its functionaries in general.57 In the following sections, I will address the submissions by the Appellant on appeal:\n",
      "\t(a) Did the RPD fail to appreciate that state agents are the agents of persecution?58\n",
      "[31] On appeal, Ms. XXXX XXXX submits that there is no obligation on a refugee claimant to test the availability of protection, when an agent of persecution is the state itself.59 She also submits on appeal that the RPD failed to consider that she was afraid of militant members of the opposition within the security apparatus herself, as evidenced by the killing of her father's colleague Felix and the attempted kidnapping of her brother, both of which were allegedly committed by police officers who oppose the regime.60\n",
      "[32] To begin with, I find that the RPD accepts as credible, the Appellant's allegations that these events were carried out by members of the Venezuelan police force. However, the RPD was not persuaded that these two events substantiate the Appellant's allegations that she faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a personal risk of harm from pro-opposition state agents, or that police authorities and other government bodies are not providing adequate protection to the state functionaries and their families, including the Appellant, if she faces this risk.\n",
      "[33] I find that the RPD is correct in its conclusion for a number of reasons. Firstly, with respect to the Appellant's allegation that she faces a serious possibility of persecution or a personal risk of harm. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant has not furnished clear and convincing evidence that family members of high-government officials, including herself and her brother, are specifically targeted by pro-opposition elements, in the police, or amongst the general public because of their affiliation with their father. In this regard, the Appellant sought to corroborate her allegations by submitting documentary evidence that similarly situated individuals were targeted because they are family members of pro-government officials. For example, the Appellant submitted into evidence an article which states that the son of a government supporter (a local council member) was killed in March 2015 at the same time as his father.61 However, the RPD concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to corroborate that the son had been specifically and independently targeted and killed.62 I find that the RPD was correct in its conclusion. In addition, I note that in her narrative, the Appellant stated that at the time that her father's colleague was shot, he was driving with his five-year-old granddaughter.63 However, there is no mention that the child was intentionally targeted, hurt or that she was killed during the attack.\n",
      "[34] With respect to the alleged kidnapping of her brother, I take note of the Appellant written narrative that her father was told that the attempted kidnapping of his son was a form of extortion.64 Hence, I find that this does not support the Appellant's statement that the alleged kidnapping was carried out for political motives or because he is targeted by pro-opposition individuals because he is the son of his father.\n",
      "[35] The Appellant also alleged that her family driver was shot in the chest by alleged enemies of her father (a wound that he survived) and the car in which the Appellant's brother was traveling at the time was also stolen. She also submitted a letter by the Chief Commissioner, of the sub-delegation for XXXX XXXX. In it, he instructs the Chief of Forensic Medicine of XXXX XXXX XXXX State to conduct a medical examination in relation to court records and investigations by the office of the crime of vehicle theft.65 After considering this evidence, I do not find that the Appellant has persuasively corroborated her allegations that the vehicle was, on a balance of probabilities, targeted with the objective of harming a family member of her father (namely her brother). The letter mentions that investigations revolve specifically around the attempted stealing of the car, and not around a kidnapping attempt or attempted murder. Furthermore, in her own testimony, she mentions that her brother escaped unharmed.\n",
      "[36] With respect to her own particular situation, the Appellant alleges that she was bullied and harassed at school because of the position of her father; that she, her mother and brother were monitored by \"unidentified\" vehicles and that her parents received threatening calls that they were being watched from unidentified callers. However, I do not find that the Appellant provided credible evidence that the bullying and harassment at school; the verbal threat by the waitress; the monitoring by unidentified vehicles or the calls from unidentified sources stating that she and other family members are being watched, indicate that there is a serious possibility of persecution, or that on a balance of probabilities she would face a risk of harm. Here, the RPD also pointed out it expected the Appellant to make efforts to get a letter of support, from her mother who was aware of her refugee protection claim, with respect to the various threats that the family received over the years, which allegedly motivated the various moves.66As the Appellant testified in response to queries by the RPD, she did not try to obtain a letter of support from her mother, on the ground that she did not know what type of letter she needed to obtain.67 I agree with the RPD that this explanation is not reasonable, given that she was represented by Counsel.68\n",
      "[37] In addition, the Federal Court has underscored that in determining whether the refugee claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection, the efforts that the victim took to seek protection from authorities must be considered.69 In this regard, there is no indication in the Appellant's testimony that she or her parents made any attempt to submit complaints with respect to the alleged threats to their personal safety, or to report any of these incidences to police authorities as a way of taking measures to seek state protection. In fact, in her written narrative Ms. XXXX XXXX states that \"[m]y family never went to the police for help, because there was no point. The police were involved in the threats my family was receiving and they did not support my family.\"70\n",
      "[38] I do not find the Appellant's explanation for why she took no steps to seek state protection, from the police or other state bodies when she felt threatened, to be persuasive. This is because the Appellant has not provided credible evidence that pro-opposition police, were involved in the threats against her or her family members. Nor has the Appellant demonstrated that pro-opposition members within the police enjoy power and influence that is of such an extent that it would render it very difficult, if not impossible for the Appellant to obtain state protection. As the Appellant testified during the hearing,71 and based on the documentary evidence which she submitted, individuals who were allegedly involved in the killing of high-profile Venezuelan government insiders, including the killing of father's colleague XXXX, were arrested and/or imprisoned.72 \n",
      "[39] Thirdly, I do not find that the objective documentary evidence in the national documentation package (NDP) on Venezuela, supports the Appellant's allegations that Venezuelan police have been overtaken by pro-opposition forces, or that police authorities and other government bodies would not be providing adequate protection to the state functionaries and their families, because of their pro-government stance. Nor does it support a finding that the alleged influence and power of the opposition within the different Venezuelan state authorities, including the police, is sufficient to support the Appellant's allegations that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\n",
      "[40] On the contrary, and as the RPD concluded, the independent documentary evidence in the NDP on Venezuela, lends support to the RPD's findings that the Appellant and her family benefits from the current regime and the manner in which it functions.73 According to one source in the NDP, a report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the weakness of democratic institutions and high levels of corruption in the country has resulted in those dissenting from the government or engaged in social protests becoming victims of serious reprisals.74 The same source points out that public officials in Venezuela have widespread powers and authority to incriminate persons accused of anti-government positions and opinions, and that those who participate in social protests are criminalized and stigmatized by senior government officials as terrorists.75 \n",
      "[41] I find that this supports the RPD's findings that the system revolves around punishing anyone associated with the opposition or perceived as being part of the opposition.76 It does not corroborate the Appellant's fear of being persecuted or harmed by Venezuelan authorities, because of her father's position, and her unwillingness to seek state protection, is objectively speaking, not well-founded.77\n",
      "[42] Similarly, I find that Exhibit A submitted by the Appellant, corroborates the information in the NDP that those who are perceived as being part of the opposition become the focus of reprisals by the government. The list was commissioned on the request of President Chavez, in order to list the names of millions of members of various political parties and civil society organizations who demand the holding of a recall referendum in order to accuse them of mega-fraud and intimidation against the opponents of the government.\n",
      "\t(b) Did the RPD's analysis focus on whether the authorities might be motivated to provide her with protection, instead of on the operational adequacy of state protection.78\n",
      "[43] On appeal, Ms. XXXX XXXX submits that the RPD focused in its analysis on the fact that the Appellant's family were pro-regime, and that therefore the authorities might be motivated to provide her with protection. She contends that the RPD erred because it should have analyzed instead, the actual ability of the Venezuelan authorities to provide protection at the operational level.79 In this regard, the Appellant alleges that a wealth of evidence indicates that there are serious shortcomings in Venezuela's protection regime, including failure to protect against kidnappings, the prevalence of widespread torture of suspects and extrajudicial killings and pervasive corruption and impunity amongst all security forces.80\n",
      "[44] I disagree with the Appellant that the RPD did not analyze the operational adequacy of state protection for a number of reasons. Firstly, I do not find that the RPD simply concluded that due to the Appellant's family pro-government stance, Venezuelan authorities would be motivated to provide the Appellant with protection. Instead, I find that the RPD analyzed the objective evidence in the NDP, as well as the documentary evidence submitted by the Appellant, before concluding that on a balance of probabilities, adequate state protection would be forthcoming in so far as government insiders and their families are concerned. According to the RPD, this is because, despite the corruption in the country, it found that there is a functioning political and judicial system and official apparatus in place, one that provides a measure of protection to the government and the citizens who are perceived to be regime supporters and actual loyal functionaries of the government.81\n",
      "[45] I find that the RPD was correct in its analysis. There is no indication in the documentary evidence that the State, including the police, is not focused on providing adequate measure of protection to regime supporters and loyal functionaries of the state.82 Sources in the NDP indicate that the Bolivarian National Police is responsible for general crime prevention and the first responder to major demonstrations and riots. The Bolivarian national intelligence service, \"investigates crimes against the government and provides protective details for government officials.\"83\n",
      "[46] And while sources within the NDP on Venezuela do corroborate the Appellant's allegations that crime, including homicides, kidnapping and robbery is prevalent in Caracas, the documentary evidence indicates that the majority of them are attributed to mobile street gangs and organized crime groups,84 and not to pro-opposition forces amongst the government bodies or the general public who are targeting pro-government supporters and officials. In addition, although corruption and inadequate police training and funding does reduce the effectiveness of security forces, the documentary evidence also points out that police officers will generally respond to ongoing emergencies, and have carried out raids, particularly through low-income communities with the declared objective of combat crime and to rid the country of armed groups with links to paramilitaries. It is during these raids and operations that police and security forces have been accused of excessive use of force, extrajudicial killings, and arbitrary detention,85 and which the Appellant sought to highlight in her Memorandum of Appeal. Again, I find no indication from the independent documentary evidence that these raids or the resulting human rights abuses, support the Appellant's allegation that there are shortcomings in the ability of the state to provide adequate protection to state functionaries and their families, or that they violate their rights. I also note that state protection does not have to be perfect or forthcoming every time. It has to be adequate.\n",
      "[47] In addition, I take note that the Appellant has not demonstrated an effort to obtain state protection. When the RPD inquired why the Appellant is unable to have her father offer her state protection from his enemies, she responded that this was not possible because it would put her and other members at risk and expose themselves too much.86 I do not find the explanation furnished by the Appellant is adequate. I also do not find that she has corroborated with credible and clear evidence, her claims that seeking this protection would put her and her family at greater risk.\n",
      "[48] In addition, the Appellant testified that she had a military bodyguard assigned to her by her father, but that in 2016, she decided to withdraw the bodyguard because she wanted to look after her life. Ms. XXXX XXXX also testified that she could get him re-assigned to her, should she choose to.87 I therefore find that the RPD is correct in concluding that this personalized protection, in the form of a bodyguard from the military, is more than adequate from the state.88\n",
      "[49] Finally, I agree with the RPD that find that the father is, on a balance of probabilities, able to use his connection (including his bodyguard) or state power to exercise an adequate level of state protection for his family members, if and when it became necessary.89 According to Ms. XXXX XXXX written narrative, following her brother's kidnapping, \"[m]y father called his bodyguard and together they located my step-brother and brought him home.\"90 In addition, the Appellant testified that her brother has been living with her father in a well-protected military area as a way of getting more protection.91 Therefore, I find that the father is well placed, by way of his connections within the system and his political position within the state, and absent evidence to the contrary by the Appellant, to offer protection to his family members, including the Appellant, when and if the need arises.\n",
      "[50] Moreover, I find that the RPD was correct in its finding that the Appellant's complaint that the only way she would be well protected is if she lived with her father in the well-protected military area, and stay home without venturing out,92 to be unfounded from an evidential perspective.93 This is because she had other forms of adequate protection available to her, such as having a bodyguard (should she choose to do so) and her dad's ability to intervene.94\n",
      "(c) Was the RPD's decision illogical and internally inconsistent, because it disregarded the Appellant's allegation that her family was advised by the regime itself of its inability to provide protection to them and that she fears the police itself?95\n",
      "[51] On appeal, Ms. XXXX XXXX submits that her family had been advised from the regime itself that it would be unable to offer protection to her family.96 In addition, she submits that, having accepted the Appellant's credibility regarding the involvement of the police in XXXX murder or her brother's kidnapping, it was objectively unreasonable for the RPD to expect her in her particular circumstances, to approach the authorities for protection.97\n",
      "[52] I do not agree with the Appellant. Firstly, I do not find that the Appellant has established her allegations that the regime itself has advised her and her family not to seek protection. With respect to the Appellant's allegations that her brother was kidnapped by police officers from the force favoring the government opposition,98 even if I accept this allegation, I still do not find that this renders it unreasonable for her to make a concentrated effort to approach state authorities for protection. As the Appellant herself testifies, her father was able to locate and bring home her kidnapped brother through a police officer and who advised him that his son had been kidnapped.99 In other words, even if I am prepared to accept that there are elements within the police force who are sympathetic to the opposition, I do not find that the Appellant has demonstrated that their power or influence in the police force is so significant and prevalent as to undermine her ability to demand and to receive adequate state protection. In addition, and as mentioned previously, the Appellant stated that the police officer who notified her father of the kidnapping of his son, mentioned that it was motivated by extortion, i.e. not by political motives.\n",
      "(d) Does the documentary evidence support the Appellant's allegations that regime change is likely in Venezuela, thereby contradicting the RPD's findings that the government in power will be able to provide protection to the Appellant?100\n",
      "[53] On appeal, Ms. XXXX XXXX submits that the socio-political state of affairs in Venezuela is in flux,101 and that regime change in Venezuela is entirely possible, thereby undermining the RPD's analysis that since the Appellant is from a pro-regime family, the regime will provide her with protection against opponents to the regime.102\n",
      "[54] I have analysed the news paper articles in Exhibit B and in additional exhibit K. With respect to Exhibit B, several of them, address a failed drone attack on Maduro that took place in August 2018, while he was speaking at a ceremony of the paramilitary national guard in central Caracas. On the one hand, according to one article exhibit B-i), the Economist, the attack was claimed by a small group called Soldiers in T-shirts, linked to a police captain who was led a brief guerilla warfare and was killed by government forces. At the same time, the article, also states that \"[s]uch groups are small and the attack looked amateurish.\"103 Moreover, the article makes the argument that this will not be the last attempt to unseat Maduro, as discontent in the army is growing. A second article (exhibit B-ii), by Bloomberg, mentions that in May 2017, a plot from all branches of the Venezuelan armed forces was thwarted and which sought to capture Maduro and put him on Trial.104 On the other hand, the Bloomberg article also notes that it is too early to conclude \"this idea that Maduro is holding on by a thread,\" as he has developed a stat policy of persecution and monitoring within the armed forces.105 According to a third and a fourth article, by the New York Times (exhibit B-vi and vii) seven men were arrested in the drone attack, and that Maduro \"offered little certainty as to who might have tried to kill him. While he blamed right-wing elements in Venezuela and the Colombian government, he offered no evidence to support that claim.\"106 Others turned to conspiracy, suggesting that he had staged it in order to justify a further crackdown against his opponents.107 A fifth (exhibit B-v) article argues that the economic collapse and military coup in Venezuela is only a matter of time, predicting it would happen by the end of the year 2018.108 The last article (exhibit B-iii) states that US President Trump had once suggested that Venezuela should be invaded.109\n",
      "[55] With respect to Additional Exhibit K, one article (i) by Al-Jazeera alleges that members of the Venezuelan opposition, negotiated a deal with a small security company based in the USA to overthrow President Maduro, and that the leader of the opposition Juan Guaido denied any links. A second article (ii) states that in September 2019 the opposition-dominated national assembly ratified Mr. Guaido as the country's interim elections can be held, while a third (iii) states that in January 2020 Mr. Guaido was scheduled to visit Canada. A fourth article (iv) is a statement by US President Trump recognizing Mr. Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela.\n",
      "[56] While I find that these articles corroborate the Appellant's allegations that there are anti-government elements within the different branches of the Venezuelan state and government (including the national assembly, police, army, and wider public) seeking to weaken Maduro's grip on power, or even overthrow him, it does not corroborate her allegations that regime change in Venezuela is around the corner or that the country and its system of governance can be characterized as a failed state. I also do not find that these media reports demonstrate, as the Appellant alleges in her further submissions that President Maduro's group on power is far more precarious than was appreciated by the RPD.110 Nor is there information in the NDP on Venezuela to corroborate that this is the case, despite a lot of information on the economic difficulties of the country. Moreover, in Ward, the Supreme Court underscored that except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. This presumption can be rebutted by \"clear and convincing\" evidence of the state's inability to protect.111 I do not find that the Appellant has provided such evidence.\n",
      "(e) Does the RPD's state protection analysis undermine the logic of refugee determination by suggesting that claimants have a chance of survival by making use of corrupt connections with an authoritarian regime?112\n",
      "[57] On appeal, Ms. XXXX XXXX submits that the RPD's state protection analysis is flawed because it expects her to avail herself of her father's suspect connections within an undemocratic regime in order to access protection,113 and to benefit from the high levels of repression towards perceived regime opponents which exists in Venezuela.114 This, she submits runs contrary to the spirit of state protection principles in refugee status determination.115\n",
      "[58] I do not agree with the Appellant that the RPD's analysis is flawed for this reason. At no point in her oral or written testimony, has the Appellant expressed her disagreement or her opposition to the work that her father is doing, or to his affiliation with the Maduro government. While the Appellant mentioned in her Memorandum of appeal that there is a generally terrible human rights climate, and high level of repression in Venezuela and that the government monitors the social media of detect opposition activity,116 I do not find that the Appellant has explained how this is relevant to her claim. At no instance has she alleged that she adopted anti-government views, activities or positions, or that the reason why she fears for her personal safety is because she has opposed the Maduro regime. Hence, the RPD concluded that \"this is not a claim that has any trace of disloyalty or opposition activism to it.\"117 I find that the RPD was correct in its finding and that it was not an error for the panel to adopt the position that the Appellant no political or ideologically motivated reason not to accept state protection (for example opposition to the state's policies or human rights record).\n",
      "[59] Moreover, I also note that the only reason which Ms. XXXX XXXX mentioned for why she refused to keep a bodyguard, or to live with her father or seek state protection is because she wanted to live her life more freely, and because seeking state protection would allegedly put her and her family at more risk. Again, she did not mention in her written or oral testimony that her refusal was motivated by her father's suspect connections within an undemocratic regime to access protection\".118\n",
      "(f) Has the Appellant established that similarly situated individuals to the Appellant, like her mother, demonstrates that she faces persecution or harm if she were to return to Venezuela?\n",
      "[60] In her additional submissions, the Appellant argues that in June 2020, upon advice from Counsel, she reached out to family members and friends in Venezuela, to inquire if there was any new information that she should be made aware of, and which is relevant to her appeal. According to the Appellant, it was then, that her mother allegedly informed her that from XXXX 2019-XXXX 2020, she was repeatedly threatened by criminals and extorted for money.119 According to the Appellant's mother affidavit, three men paid showed up every month at her business to collect extortion money of XXXX USD; that they were violent towards her, and that they threatened to kill her if she refused to pay. She also stated that they always mentioned the Appellant's father, pointing out that she has money to pay because she had a relationship with him more than 15 years ago.120 \n",
      "[61] However, I do not find that the Appellant has established that her mother is being extorted because of her connections with the Appellant's father, as a similarly situated individual, and that therefore there is a serious risk of persecution, or on a balance of probabilities, a risk of harm given the absence of adequate state protection at the operational level. Instead, and for the following reasons, I find that on a balance of probabilities, the mother, as the owner of a business, is the victim of a generalized risk of organized crime, and criminal violence due to the criminal's perception that she has money. Here, I take note that in her affidavit, the Appellant's mother submits that she is considering leaving the country, \"due to insecurity, crime, the unstable economy and above all due to the threats and demands for money that I have to pay.\"121 The same, I find is the situation with respect to the event on XXXX XXXX, 2020 during which the Appellant's mother was allegedly robbed by two individuals on a motorcycle who intercepted her outside her outside her residential building and stole her purse.122  \n",
      "[62] The Appellant's mother also submitted three affidavits by employees working at her business, who allegedly know of these extortion demands and witnessed the threats that were made. However, I do not find that these affidavits (all dated XXXX XXXX, 2020) establish, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant's allegations that her mother was extorted because of her relation to the Appellant's father: while they state that she was threatened and mistreated by three individuals who regularly showed up at her business to collect a monthly fee from he, none of the affidavits corroborate the Appellant's allegation that the criminals have in their visits, mentioned that the extortion is any way motivated by the Appellant's mother's relation to her father.123 This is despite the fact that the Appellant's mother has in her affidavit stated that they have made that statement \"many times\" during their visits. And although the Appellant's mother states that these men came on a monthly basis between XXXX 2019 to XXXX 2020, and threatened to kill her if she does not pay the money, I draw a negative inference from the Appellant's mother choosing to continue her routine activity of operating her business. This despite her allegation that she made a police report in XXXX 2019 and had received no protection and that she feared that those individuals, who extorted her for months would come to my house.\"124  I find that if her life was at a serious risk of harm, she would have made an effort to close/relocate her business, or to remain in the Capital City, where she traditionally resided between one and two weeks at a given time, for a longer period of time.125  \n",
      "[63] With respect to the second incident, XXXX XXXX, 2020, the Appellant's mother mentions that they were two men who robbed he; that they knew about the first police report she submitted in XXXX 2019, and that during the robbery, they threatened to kill her if she did not pay the fees. However, nowhere in her affidavit does the Appellant's mother indicate that the two men who robbed her are two of the same men who entered her shop and had asked for the extortion money. \n",
      "[64] Furthermore, the Appellant had submitted an affidavit by the security guard outside her residential building, who allegedly witnessed the robbery (also dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020).126 Here, I find that the affidavit establishes, that she was the victim of a crime, but not that these two individuals were the same people who together with a third one, were extorting her on a monthly basis. Similarly, while a copy of the police report states that the Appellant's mother was robbed by two unknown individuals in XXXX 2020, it states that she was extorted in XXXX by three unknown individuals.127 There is no mention by the Appellant's mother in the report that she identified any of the individuals in the first incident to be the same who had frequented her business or that they possibly belonged to one criminal gang. Here, I find that the report has little probative value in establishing the facts for which it was offered as proof. The evidence only establishes that the Appellant had filed a criminal complaint, but does not establish that the incidents described by the Appellant in her narrative occurred, nor do they establish that she was targeted due to perceptions that she is associated with the Appellant's father. \n",
      "Given that I agree with the RPD that find that the father is, on a balance of probabilities, able to use his connection (including his bodyguard) or state power to exercise an adequate level of state protection for his family members, if and when it became necessary, I do not find that the Appellant's mother has demonstrated that se made an effort to reach out to him to secure state protection. It is not clear from her affidavit why she did not inform him of the extortion that she was subjected to, and that she has filed two police reports in this regard, which allegedly were not followed up on by police authorities. \n",
      "[65] In light of the above, I do not find that the Appellant has established that her mother's experience demonstrates the type of risk that the Appellant would potentially face in Venezuela, were anyone to find out who her father is, if she were to return to Venezuela.128  \n",
      "2. Credibility Findings of the RPD\n",
      "[66] With respect to the credibility of the Appellant, the RPD found that there were problems in the consistency of her evidence, particularly with respect to the addresses that she had listed in her Schedule A and BOC,129 and drew adverse inferences from these inconsistencies with respect to her credibility.130 However, the panel also acknowledges that this finding is fairly tertiary to the rest of the claim, and therefore reduced the weight that it gave to this adverse inference.131\n",
      "[67] The RPD also drew an adverse inference as to the Appellant's credibility with respect to her failure to mention in her written narrative that the main reason she delayed coming to Canada is that her father was against it, on the grounds that he thought she would be safer in Venezuela and that he is unaware that she claimed refugee status in Canada (as opposed to her mother who knew). However, the panel also found that this is not a credibility finding that renders the claim generally not credible.132\n",
      "[68]  I find that the RPD was correct in its findings. I do not find that there is a need to elaborate in more detail on these findings since the determinative issue in this claim is adequate state protection.\n",
      "[69] Finally, I want to address the Appellant's allegations in her additional submissions that the newspaper article in Additional Exhibit K(v) underscores that the decision of the RPD member who presided over the hearing of the Appellant's refugee protection claim, should not be afforded any deference by the RAD. According to the Appellant this is because the media article reported allegations of misconduct in this member's hearing of another refugee protection claim. After listening to the recording of the proceedings of the hearing and analyzing all of the documentary evidence, I do not find that the RPD member, in reaching his decision concerning the appeal that is before me, acted improperly, or that he displayed bias in deciding the Appellant's claim. I can only decide the appeal by what is before me concerning the Appellant's claim and the RPD's adjudication of that claim. I also point out that anyone, including the Appellant, could file a complaint against an IRB member about conduct that he/she believes to have taken place contrary to the code of conduct for IRB members: procedures for making a complaint are available on the website of the Immigration and Refugee Board.133\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[70] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a citizen of Mexico. He is appealing the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision dated January 21, 2020, rejecting his refugee protection claim on the basis that he has an internal flight alternative (IFA) in the cities of Merida and Tlaxcala, Mexico.\n",
      "[2] The appellant alleges that the RPD erred:\n",
      "a. in basing its decision on a document that does not exist or is no longer in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Mexico (Response to Information Request [RIR] MEX 103776 E);1 and\n",
      "b. in disregarding almost all of Tab 13.1, which the appellant cited as an authoritative source in his favour.2\n",
      "[3] The appellant is requesting that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) refer his case to a differently constituted RPD panel.3\n",
      "[4] The appellant did not provide any new evidence, but is requesting that an oral hearing be held before the RAD.4\n",
      "[5] The determinative issue before the RAD, as it was for the RPD, is whether the appellant has an IFA in Merida or Tlaxcala.\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[6] The RAD confirms the RPD's determination and dismisses the appeal.\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "[7] According to his Basis of Claim Form, the appellant, who was a XXXX in the state of Chiapas, alleges that rebels from the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) forcibly took over his farmland (two hectares) on or about March 10, 2019.\n",
      "[8] The appellant allegedly asked the authorities for help, but was told that they do not get involved in EZLN matters because they fear reprisals.\n",
      "[9] The appellant left Mexico for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and claimed refugee protection.\n",
      "Holding an oral hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division\n",
      "[10] The RAD appeal process is generally a paper-based process. Prior to holding an oral hearing, new evidence must be accepted on appeal in accordance with subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the new evidence, if accepted, must raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the appellant, must be central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim, and would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n",
      "[11] Given that no new evidence has been submitted or accepted, there is no cause to hold an oral hearing in this case.\n",
      "STANDARD OF REVIEW\n",
      "[12] The RAD reviews RPD decisions, applying the correctness standard of review after conducting its own analysis of the record. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in assessing credibility.5 That said, the RAD's role is to determine whether, as argued by the appellant, the RPD did indeed err.\n",
      "[13] The RAD applied the correctness standard in this case.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "A) Did the Refugee Protection Division rely on a document that does not exist (Response to Information Request MEX 103776 E)?\n",
      "[14] In his memorandum, the appellant argues that the RPD based its decision on a document that does not exist or that is no longer included in the NDP on Mexico dated August 30, 2019, that is, RIR MEX 103776 E. The appellant's counsel states that he went through the NDP and the index of RIRs on Mexico and even search engines several times, but he could not find the document.6\n",
      "[15] The appellant's counsel states: [translation] \"If the document does not exist, it should not be included in the NDP or RIRs and should not be included in the evidence. If a claimant cannot consult the NDP or RIR, he cannot present his case because he does not have all of the evidence.\"7\n",
      "[16] With respect, the RAD looked into this matter, and the document in question (RIR MEX 103776.E) does exist and can be found in the database of RIRs in the NDP, at tabs 1 (General Information and Maps), 2 (Human Rights), 7 (Criminality and Corruption), 13 (Nationality, Ethnicity and Race) and 14 (Exit/Entry and Freedom of Movement).\n",
      "[17] Here is an example of a search on the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada's website, which shows that the document is indeed there and that the appellant's counsel simply did not search properly:\n",
      "\n",
      "[18] In the RAD's view, the first criticism has no merit, and the RPD did not err.\n",
      "B) Did the Refugee Protection Division disregard nearly all of Tab 13.1?\n",
      "[19] The RPD notes that [translation] \"according to the objective evidence, the EZLN group's activities are based in the state of Chiapas. It indicates that the Zapatistas remain popular at the local level in Chiapas. In addition, RIR MEX 103776 E states that the Zapatistas have eschewed violence since their initial rebellion...and are concentrating on organization and community work in the state of Chiapas.\"8\n",
      "[20] The appellant submits that this statement disregards almost all of the contents of Tab 13.1, and he cites section 1.2 of that document, which states that \"30,000 IDPs [internally displaced people] have been living in protracted displacement in Chiapas since the 1994 to 1995 Zapatista conflict....\"9 \n",
      "[21] The appellant submits that the RPD's reasoning is flawed and constitutes a palpable and determinative error by the RPD.10\n",
      "[22] Finally, the appellant argues that the RPD failed to consider the difficulty that people from Chiapas face in settling elsewhere in Mexico because of the stigma caused by the conflict.11\n",
      "[23] The RAD disagrees.\n",
      "[24] Section 1.2 of Tab 13.1 in the NDP on Mexico, cited in the appellant's memorandum, refers to displacements within the state of Chiapas. This does not contradict the RPD's decision to suggest IFAs in areas outside of that state because the EZLN group's activities are based in the state of Chiapas.\n",
      "[25] With respect to the argument that people from Chiapas have difficulty settling elsewhere in Mexico because of the stigma caused by the conflict, the appellant made no specific, detailed submission on the type or nature of those difficulties. People from the state of Chiapas are Mexican citizens, and there are no laws or regulations in Mexico that would prevent them from settling elsewhere in the country.\n",
      "[26] Moreover, at the hearing, neither the appellant nor his counsel identified any specific issues that are unique to people from the state of Chiapas in being able to settle outside of their state of origin.\n",
      "[27] When asked to explain if he had reasons, other than his fear of the EZLN, why he could not settle in the proposed IFAs, the appellant mentioned only the insecurity in the country.\n",
      "[28] The RAD is of the opinion that the appellant's arguments are unfounded and that the RPD did not err in its conclusions.\n",
      "C) The internal flight alternative in Merida and Tlaxcala\n",
      "[29] Although the appellant did not challenge the RPD's conclusions on the two prongs of the IFA, besides two sentences without any explanation or specific and detailed submission:\n",
      "- The RPD erred in the test for an IFA in Merida or Tlaxcala;12 and\n",
      "- Merida is too close to Chiapas, and Tlaxcala would be unreasonable given the situation in that state;13\n",
      "[30] The RAD conducted its own analysis:\n",
      "[31] In Rasaratnam14 and Thirunavukkarasu,15 the Federal Court of Appeal defined the test for assessing an IFA. It is two-pronged:\n",
      "1. ...The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.16\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.17\n",
      "[32] Both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that an IFA exists. The onus is on the appellant to establish that he would be at risk and/or that it would be unreasonable for the appellant to seek refuge in the IFA location.\n",
      "The first prong\n",
      "[33] The RPD concluded that the appellant has failed to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that his agents of harm would be able to find him in Merida or Tlaxcala, which are the proposed IFAs.\n",
      "[34] The appellant testified that he does not intend to return to Chiapas to reclaim his land. His wife and two children, who stayed in Mexico, still live in Chiapas and have not had any problems with the Zapatistas.\n",
      "[35] The appellant also testified that his 16-year-old son continues to go to the same school without any problem or incident.\n",
      "[36] Finally, the RPD asked the appellant about his safety in the proposed IFAs and how the Zapatistas could find him. His answers were vague, evasive and unpersuasive: [translation] \"they track you with photographs\" and \"only they know how to do it.\" These answers do not satisfy the RAD, on a balance of probabilities, that the Zapatistas, who are already in possession of the land, have an interest in looking for the appellant in the proposed IFAs.\n",
      "[37] These conclusions are not contested. The RAD concludes that they are correct and that the RPD did not err.\n",
      "The second prong\n",
      "[38] The RPD concluded that it would not be unreasonable for the appellant to seek refuge in the cities of Merida or Tlaxcala. The appellant had failed to demonstrate that he would not be able to go to these IFAs and find work and housing and receive care there. \n",
      "[39] The RAD, like the RPD, is of the opinion that the appellant has failed to establish that the proposed cities would be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances.\n",
      "[40] With respect to the appellant's only argument to reject the proposed IFAs, that [translation] \"Merida is too close to Chiapas, and Tlaxcala would be unreasonable given the situation in that state,\" the RAD disagrees with the argument made against Merida. The shortest distance between the appellant's city in Chiapas (Comitan de Dominguez) and Merida is 752 km. There is no explanation about the situation in Tlaxcala in the memorandum.\n",
      "[41] The RAD concludes that the appellant has an IFA in Merida or Tlaxcala.\n",
      "[42] The RAD concludes that the RPD's decision is correct.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[43] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the RPD's determination, namely, that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW \n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Appellant, alleges he is a citizen of Somalia, and a member of the minority XXXX clan. He is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant requests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the RPD's negative determination and find that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. In the alternative, the Appellant requests the RAD to refer the matter back to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. The Appellant has not requested that the RAD admit new evidence in the present appeal, and has not requested an oral hearing.1\n",
      "DETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n",
      "[2] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),2 the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Appellant is a Convention refugee. The appeal is allowed.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "[3] The Appellant alleges that he is a member of the minority XXXX clan, as well as a practitioner of Sufi Islam. The Appellant claims that he fears a return to Somalia after Al-Shabaab killed his brother and an employee at the Appellant's XXXX in Mogadishu for allegedly promoting Westernization by allowing women to get XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the shop, and for XXXX XXXX. He states that Al-Shabaab targeted him and continued to search for him; the Appellant, his wife and his mother all fled to Kenya, and the Appellant made his way to Canada to seek protection. He also fears persecution in Somalia because of his membership in the minority XXXX clan and as a practitioner of Sufi Islam.\n",
      "[4] The Appellant had a refugee determination hearing on June 12, 2018, and the RPD rejected his claim in a written decision dated June 26, 2018.  The RPD found the Appellant had established his identity, but that he had failed to establish the events which he alleged occurred in Somalia, on a balance of probabilities.3 \n",
      "[5] In the present appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in relying on its specialized knowledge of \"BECO\", the Somali electrical company, which the RPD noted is known to provide receipts for electrical use payment. The Appellant alleges the RPD erred in faulting the Appellant for not having provided documents which place him in Somalia during the time in which he alleges the material events occurred, documents such as BECO receipts. He asserts that by not giving notice that the RPD intended to rely on its specialized knowledge, the RPD breached the Appellant's right to procedural fairness. \n",
      "[6] In addition, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment, including by faulting the Appellant for a lack of efforts to provide documents to corroborate his claim, while failing to assess the documents he did provide, namely affidavits from his wife and mother in Kenya, and from his father's friend in Mogadishu, as well as the XXXX XXXX letter regarding the Appellant's identity as assessed by the XXXX XXXX organization in Canada. The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred in failing to give reasons why it gave little weight to the testimony of the witness, and for failing to assess the Appellant's risk due to his Sufi religion and his minority clan ethnicity, given that the panel accepted his identity. Lastly, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred by failing to assess his refugee sur place claim, namely that he would be at risk by Al-Shabaab if he were to return to Somalia, simply on the basis of having spent time in the West, in Canada, and that he would therefore be targeted on this basis. \n",
      "[7] As the RAD has found that the RPD erred in failing to assess the Appellant's claim as a member of the minority XXXX clan and as a practitioner of Sufi Islam, given that the RPD accepted his identity, and given that this error is dispositive of this appeal, the other allegations raised by the Appellant need not be dealt with.  \n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[8] Given that the RPD accepted the Appellant's identity as credible, on a balance of probabilities,4 this finding necessarily includes the Appellant's personal identity, including his ethnicity and religion, and his identity as a Somali national. However, the RPD failed to assess the Appellant's risk profile on the basis of his minority clan identity or religious identity. \n",
      "[9] According to the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) form, the Appellant identifies himself as a member of the XXXX minority ethnic group and as a practitioner of Sufism, a sect of Sunni Islam.5 His BOC narrative also recounts the persecution he and his family experienced as a result of their XXXX clanship, indicating \"Because we are XXXX, Hawiye men would often refuse to pay for our services calling us XXXX. Our business suffered greatly and there was nothing we could do to fight back because we are a minority and powerless clan.\"6 His XXXX ethnicity and Sufi Muslim religion are corroborated by the affidavits of the Appellant's family and a longtime family friend.7\n",
      "[10] The RAD has considered the documentary evidence in Somalia in relation to the Appellant's circumstances and profile. \n",
      "[11] Minority Rights Group International confirms that the XXXX are a minority clan subject to widespread marginalization and discrimination,8 and suffer denial and abuse of \"the whole range of basic human rights\".9 Other sources cite \"ethnic or clan discrimination\", in some cases severe, against XXXX minority clans, which includes the XXXX, and confirm that such minorities are prohibited from inter-marriage and the children are prohibited from attending school.10 It is also reported that the XXXX often face discrimination and social stigma due to their occupations, and the human rights situation of these groups in northern Somalia, where most of the XXXX live, is considered bad although slightly improving.11 The United States Department of State indicates that \"[m]inority groups, often lacking armed militias, continued to be disproportionately subjected to killings, torture, rape, kidnapping for ransom, and looting of land and property with impunity by faction militias and majority clan members, often with the acquiescence of federal and local authorities. Many minority communities continued to live in deep poverty and to suffer from numerous forms of discrimination and exclusion.\"12\n",
      "[12] The documentary evidence states that Al-Shabaab has come to rely heavily on the Amniyaad [the intelligence wing of Al-Shabaab] to maintain a presence in Mogadishu and other major towns, and continues to carry out terrorist-style attacks, including in Mogadishu.13 Sources state that Al-Shabaab is against the practice of Sufism as Al-Shabaab regards Sufis \"as non-believers and legitimate targets for attacks.\"14 Al-Shabaab has \"frequently committed violence against Sufism,\" including violence against clerics and desecration of Sufi shrines, as the group considers that Sufis violate Al-Shabaab's strict interpretation of Islam.15 \n",
      "[13] The Appellant's evidence indicates that members of the minority XXXX clan do not have protection stemming from association with a majority clan and therefore experience discrimination and exploitation. He also asserts that he was targeted by Al-Shabaab in the past. The Appellant's evidence is consistent with, and is not contradicted by, the objective country condition documents. Thus, there is an objective basis to support the Appellant's subjective fears and there is a well-founded fear of persecution. The RAD finds that the Appellant has established with sufficient credible evidence a well-founded fear of persecution in Somalia based upon his minority clanship and his religion as a Sufi. This places the Appellant at risk in Somalia, according to the objective country condition documentation. \n",
      "Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) and State Protection \n",
      "[14] While it is noted in the documents that Sufi practitioners in Somalia cannot freely practice their religion in Al-Shabaab-controlled districts and localities, the same source indicates people can move to areas that are not under Al-Shabaab control, including Mogadishu, where they can freely practise their religion.16 However, other sources indicate that security continues to be a significant concern, including for residents of Mogadishu: according to Amnesty International, \"Al-Shabab retains the ability to stage lethal attacks even in the most heavily guarded parts of the city [Mogadishu]' and that a [l]ack of discipline and command control within Somalia's armed forces and allied armed groups means that they not only fail to provide civilian protection, but are actually contributing to the overall insecurity. State security forces continue to be infiltrated by criminal, radical or insurgent elements.\"17 Moreover, sources indicate that minority clanship continues to be an issue throughout the country, noting that the XXXX often face persecution with few options for redress, particularly where minority clans lack armed militias.18 In light of the foregoing, I find that state protection would not be available to the Appellant, nor is there a viable IFA in Somalia for the Appellant in his particular circumstances.\n",
      "[15] The RAD finds that the Appellant has established a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Somalia, on the basis of his minority XXXX clan profile, as well as on his Sufi religious profile, in accordance with section 96 of the IRPA.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[16] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the IRPA, the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its determination that the Appellant has a profile which gives rise to a finding that he is a Convention refugee, as he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Somalia on the basis of his minority clanship, and as a Sufi. This appeal is allowed.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] The appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of India. He is alleging a fear of returning to his country because the Indian police, which wrongly accused him of working with Khalistan militants, is again targeting him. \n",
      "[2] On March 7, 2019, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellant's claim for refugee protection because it found that he was not credible owing to contradictions and omissions in his account and the fact that he was reluctant or unable to provide details in his testimony.\n",
      "[3] The appellant is appealing against the RPD's decision. He submitted that it erred in its assessment of his credibility, not taking his testimony at the hearing into account. \n",
      "[4] In my opinion, the determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the appellant's credibility. After a comprehensive and independent analysis of the evidence submitted, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err. \n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[5] I dismiss this appeal and confirm the RPD's determination. I am of the opinion that the RPD correctly concluded that the appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "[6] The appellant is a member of the Dalit caste in India. Between 2014 and 2015, he allegedly had an employee by the name of XXXX XXXX. In 2015, the employee reportedly began working for the Khalistan and was hiding from authorities. In XXXX and XXXX 2015, police allegedly made inquiries with the appellant regarding his former employee. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the appellant was reportedly stopped at a police roadblock and detained and questioned by police for an hour. At that time, the appellant allegedly saw police taking his former employee's wife and a young Sikh in a jeep. After being released, the appellant reportedly notified his former employee's family and provided an affidavit. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the appellant was allegedly stopped, taken and tortured by police. He was reportedly released the next day after paying a bribe. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, he was allegedly stopped and tortured by police and released after paying a bribe. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, men allegedly shot at the appellant. On XXXX XXXX, he was reportedly questioned by police. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the appellant allegedly fled India with the help of a smuggler and arrived in Canada the same day.\n",
      "ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n",
      "[7] The RAD must apply the correctness standard, in accordance with the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Huruglica.1 Accordingly, I will carry out my own analysis of the record, including listening to the recording of the hearing, to determine whether the RPD erred.\n",
      "ANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\n",
      "[8] The appellant submitted that the RPD's decision contained numerous errors with respect to its assessment of his credibility. He alleged that the RPD did not assess his credibility in light of his testimony at the hearing. The appellant cites the presumption of truthfulness set out in Maldonado.2\n",
      "[9] It is established that the \"presumption\" that a claimant's sworn testimony is true is always rebuttable, and, in appropriate circumstances, may be rebutted by the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention.3 That said, it is also established that the presumption of truthfulness of a claimant's allegations is not unchallengeable and can be rebutted when there is some reason to doubt that truthfulness.4 That is the case, for instance, when the evidence is inconsistent with the claimant's sworn testimony5 or when the RPD is not satisfied with the claimant's explanation for the inconsistencies in his account.6 After carrying out my own analysis of the record, I am of the opinion that that is precisely the situation in this case. \n",
      "[10] Specifically, the RPD considered that the appellant was reluctant to testify, did not provide details and evaded the questions he was asked. I listened to the recording of the hearing and I consider that the appellant was indeed vague regarding several aspects of his testimony. For instance, when the RPD asked him to state when he decided to leave India to seek refuge in Canada, he remained silent for a long time without answering. The RPD rephrased the question. After a long silence, he dodged the RPD's rather straightforward question and stated that he had left India on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Despite the fact that his lawyer rephrased the question and asked him to answer, the appellant stated that people continued to attack him, that police alleged he had ties to terrorists, that his life was in danger and that that was why he decided to leave India; yet again, this does not at all answer the question he was asked. \n",
      "[11] When asked by his lawyer to state when he decided to leave India, he answered that it was between 2014 and 2015 and that he came to Canada in 2016;7 since that answer was not clear, the RPD gave him another opportunity to state when he decided to flee his country. The appellant repeated that he had fled because his life was in danger. The RPD went to the trouble of giving him another opportunity to answer, not by providing a date or period, but by stating which incident was behind his decision to leave India. Again, however, the appellant was unable to provide a detailed answer and repeated that his life was in danger and that that was why he left his country.8\n",
      "[12] In my opinion, these answers are vague and lack spontaneity. The argument alleged on appeal that the RPD should have taken into account the appellant's level of education and the fact that he had never testified before a court and that he understood the impact that the RPD's decision could have on his life in Canada do not explain these vague answers in relation to such a rudimentary aspect of his account. These considerations should not prevent the appellant from spontaneously stating when he decided to flee his country in order to save his life and which incident prompted him to do so, given that he personally experienced the alleged incidents on which his refugee protection claim is based. In light of that, like the RPD, I am of the opinion that his credibility is undermined as a result.\n",
      "[13] This is especially true given that, as the RPD sought an explanation for his inability to state which incident had led him to decide his country and when he decided to do so, the appellant testified as follows: [translation] \"Everything that happened is written in my account.\"\n",
      "[14] The RPD also drew a negative inference from a significant omission in the appellant's Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form). Although he testified at the hearing that his spouse had been raped by police on XXXX XXXX, 2017, it is not mentioned in his BOC Form.9 In my opinion, the answer he gave the RPD to explain this significant omission, namely, that the girl who wrote his account wrote it that way, is not satisfactory. First, the appellant stated that he was the one who told the girl in Punjabi what to write. Second, he had the assistance of a lawyer when preparing and submitting his BOC Form, and, in signing his BOC Form, he indicated that the information provided in his BOC Form was complete, true and correct, which he also confirmed at the beginning of the hearing. In signing his BOC Form, he confirmed that it had been translated to him and that his declaration has the same force and effect as if made under oath.\n",
      "[15] Furthermore, his spouse's rape by Indian police entrusted with protecting Indian citizens is a serious and extremely violent act against someone close to him. The appellant testified that it was the worst incident he had experienced in India. In the circumstances, the fact that he had just eight years of education, had never testified before a court and realized the importance of the RPD's decision on his future in Canada is not sufficient to explain such a significant omission. \n",
      "[16] Moreover, I took into account the appellant's argument on appeal that it was difficult to talk about rape for a person from rural India and that it was only when he appeared before the court that he had the courage to talk about the event. That said, given the severity of the act committed by police, the same authority allegedly looking for him today, the argument that the crime against his spouse was perpetrated in connection with his own alleged problems with police does not, in my opinion, explain the omission noted in a satisfactory manner. In light of that, I consider that this omission undermines his credibility. The RPD did not err.\n",
      "[17] The RPD considered the fact that the appellant contradicted himself regarding essential elements in his account. Whereas he testified that, on XXXX XXXX, 2016, he was assaulted during a meeting of local leaders by them and by police,10 according to his BOC Form, the events unfolded otherwise. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, unidentified men allegedly shot at him on his way back from work, whereas, on XXXX XXXX, 2016, a local leaders meeting was reportedly held, but he was not attacked. The recording of the hearing reveals that the appellant was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation when confronted by the RPD with these contradictions. He first recounted that the XXXX XXXX meeting was held by human rights organizations, whereas he was attacked on XXXX XXXX; this does not at all explain the contradictions noted.11 Then, when the RPD sought to ascertain whether it was a single event or two separate events that occurred on XXXX XXXX and XXXX, the appellant cited an attack by police on XXXX XXXX, 2016, which, yet again, does not at all explain the contradictions noted. Nonetheless, the RPD made sure to give him another opportunity to explain, and he repeated that the XXXX XXXX meeting pertained to human rights and that, on XXXX XXXX, he was attacked. In my opinion, the appellant did not explain the contradictions.\n",
      "[18] Considering that he reportedly experienced these central and serious events personally, I am of the opinion that his level of education does not explain these major contradictions between his testimony at the hearing and his written testimony and that this undermines his credibility. The RPD did not err.\n",
      "[19] Contrary to the appellant's claim that the RPD relied solely on the contradictions regarding these two events to conclude that the appellant lacked credibility overall, which are secondary or peripheral issues, I note that it instead considered a set of problems in his account that were not explained in a satisfactory manner. \n",
      "[20] With respect to the appellant's argument that the RPD did not take into account the evidence submitted because it did not mention Exhibit R-3, a letter regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX, in its decision, I am of the opinion that it would have been preferable for the RPD to mention this letter and to explain why it was given no probative value. That said, this is not a fatal error of law given the extent of the problems noted in his account.\n",
      "[21] In addition, as set out in a recent Federal Court decision, \"Evidence is not assessed in isolation from the overall claim, and where the Applicant's personal [...] evidence is not credible it is reasonable for the RAD to have credibility concerns with the supporting documentary evidence\".12\n",
      "[22] Specifically, I note that the author of the letter does not explain that they witnessed the events alleged by the appellant, which were found not to be credible.13 Accordingly, no weight must be given to this letter to establish that the appellant would face a risk in returning to India.\n",
      "[23] In light of the foregoing, I consider that the appellant failed to credibly establish his allegations. The RPD did not err.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[24] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the RPD's determination that the appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX (the principal appellant) and his wife, XXXX XXXX (the associate appellant), are citizens of Haiti. They are appealing against a Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision excluding them pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention. Their minor children, the associate appellants, XXXX XXXX XXXX (citizen of the United States) and XXXX XXXX (citizen of Brazil), are appealing against an RPD decision rejecting their refugee protection claims, determining that they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n",
      "[2] The adult appellants argue that they lost their permanent residence in Brazil and that the RPD erred by applying the exclusion. With regard to their minor children, they argue that their best interest is to be with them.\n",
      "[3] The determinative issues are the following:\n",
      "- Was the exclusion based on Article 1E of the Convention applied correctly?\n",
      "- Was the minor appellants' fear examined correctly?\n",
      "[4] I conclude that the principal appellant and his wife are excluded and that their minor children are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. I conclude that the RPD's decision is correct and the appeal is dismissed.\n",
      "FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n",
      "[5] The principal appellant alleges that in November 2009, criminals killed his father, as well as two cousins while they were working on his land. He was able to escape and fled to Port-au-Prince. In XXXX 2010, he went to Ecuador and in XXXX 2013, he settled in Brazil. In 2012, the criminals were looking for him but were unable to find him; therefore, they set his wife's house in Port-au-Prince on fire. This caused her to flee from Haiti in XXXX 2013. She joined the principal appellant in Brazil in XXXX 2013. After being the victims of discrimination in Brazil, and following the birth of their minor son in July 2014, the family left for the United States in XXXX 2016. They arrived in XXXX 2016 and their second son was born in July 2017. The appellants entered Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, and filed a refugee protection claim.\n",
      "ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION \n",
      "[6] I proceeded with my own review of the evidence, which included reading the transcript of the hearing, and I applied the correctness standard of review.1\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "Exclusion ? Permanent residence in Brazil\n",
      "[7] The RPD's decision to raise and examine the issue of exclusion was based on the adult appellants' testimony according to which, in 2014, they obtained permanent resident status for a period of ten years. Another reason for the RPD's decision was that the principal appellant's wife's (the associate appellant) name and passport number appear on a list published by the Brazilian government in November 2015, confirming that she had been granted permanent resident status, subject to a certain number of administrative formalities. At the hearing, the principal appellant declared that six months after their child was born in Brazil, he and his wife received a confirmation from the authorities that they had obtained permanent residence.\n",
      "[8] The RPD was of the opinion that, on a balance of probabilities, their permanent residence was granted according to a special order for family reunification, valid for a period of five years rather than ten years, as declared by the appellants at the hearing. The RPD was unable to determine the basis upon which the adult appellants allegedly obtained permanent residence for a period of ten years. It is of the view that, contrary to the humanitarian visa that is issued for five years and for which renewal is subject to conditions, such as submitting proof of employment, the order for family reunification is permanent.2 The RPD concluded that the adult appellants obtained permanent residence in Brazil and they had substantially similar status to that of Brazilian nationals with regard to employment, educations, health and social services.\n",
      "[9] I note that the adult appellants did not challenge the RPD's conclusion that they obtained permanent resident status in Brazil. Nonetheless, I reviewed this conclusion and I am of the view that the appellants did indeed obtain permanent resident status in Brazil, granting them rights substantially similar to those of the country's nationals. Accordingly, the RPD's conclusion on this matter is correct.\n",
      "Zeng factors\n",
      "[10] The factors for the exclusion found in Article 1E of the Refugee Covention were provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng (paragraph 28):\n",
      "\tConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\n",
      "[11] In order to fully illustrate the various steps of the exclusion analysis, the review of the application of Article 1E must be conducted on the day of the hearing before the RPD, as established in Majebi.3 The RPD was of the opinion that the evidence on the record revealed that on the day of the hearing, the adult appellants had lost their permanent resident status in Brazil because they had been absent from that country for over two years. In their appeal memorandum, the appellants argue that they lost their permanent resident status because they had been out of the country for over two years.\n",
      "[12] I note that there were two hearings held before the RPD, namely on January 17 and on June 25, 2019. The appellants claim that they left Brazil in 2016. That being said, I am of the opinion that on the day of the hearing before the RPD, the adult appellants had indeed been absent from Brazil for a period of over two years and, therefore, no longer have permanent resident status. The RPD's conclusion is correct.\n",
      "1- Reason for loss of status in Brazil? voluntary or involuntary\n",
      "[13] At the hearing, the principal appellant declared that he had been a victim of discrimination in Brazil. He stated that certain new Haitian migrants had not been behaving appropriately and that had created a negative impression of Haitians. This was the reason why he lost his job as a XXXX. He added that he had not been personally attacked, but explained that he allegedly could have been because there had been attacks and murders.4 As for the associate appellant, in the context of the possibilities for her son who was born in Brazil if he were to return to the country, she stated that the colour of his skin, along with the difficulties of finding a place to live and a job were ways that he could be discriminated against. \n",
      "[14] The RPD concluded that the adult appellants were credible with regard to the experiences that they endured in Brazil. Although the RPD was of the opinion that it was regrettable that Haitians were victims of discrimination and sporadic violence, it was of the opinion that their decision to leave the country was a choice and, therefore, voluntary, making this a factor that weighs in favour of the exclusion.\n",
      "[15] In their appeal memorandum, the appellants argue that the evidence as a whole aligns with the known facts about the situation of Haitians in Brazil. They argue that the RPD erred because it failed to push its analysis further with regard to their fears of returning to Brazil and that its decision was unreasonable. They also argue that in order to satisfy the subjective component of the well-founded fear test, the refugee protection claimant, who is presumed to be truthful, must demonstrate to the RPD that the alleged fear exists in their mind. They state that once a refugee protection claimant is found to be a credible witness and that they testify in a consistent manner, their testimony is sufficient to satisfy the subjective component. They argue that the RPD found that they were credible with regard to the experiences that they faced in Brazil. The appellants state that they did not voluntarily leave Brazil, a country where they were victims of persecution due to the colour of their skin. They claim that they were no longer safe anywhere in Brazil and that because of the discrimination against Haitians, corruption, the authorities' involvement in criminal activity, and the inefficiency of the justice system, they could not be protected by the authorities. They claim that the RPD failed to consider all of the evidence, which sufficiently demonstrates the precarious security situation for Haitians in Brazil.\n",
      "[16] I note that the appellants put an emphasis on the lack of state protection and internal flight alternatives in Brazil. While I am sympathetic to the discrimination that certain Haitian nationals face in Brazil, I am of the opinion that the appellants failed to establish that this discrimination, if applicable, constitutes persecution. The principal appellant declared that he worked in Brazil and that he was never the victim of persecution. Rather, he expressed his fear of the danger and discrimination toward Haitians. I also note that Brazil is not free from racism and discrimination toward Haitians or other residents who come from abroad. Furthermore, I am of the view that this racism and discrimination were not to such an extent that it could have allegedly caused the appellants to involuntarily leave Brazil. The RPD's conclusion is correct.\n",
      "2- Possibility of returning to Brazil\n",
      "[17] The RPD was of the opinion that although there are administrative proceedings, the parameters and the scope of the recourse not yet been specified. The RPD concluded that this was a neutral factor that weighs neither in favour nor against the application of the exclusion clause pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention.\n",
      "[18] In their appeal memorandum, the appellants argue that they lost their permanent resident status and that they can no longer return to Brazil. They state that the ambiguity in the evidence surrounding the possibility of them returning to Brazil weighs in their favour.\n",
      "[19] I agree with the appellants, who claim that they lost their permanent residence status and they cannot return to Brazil. Concerning the evidence on the record, I am of the view that someone automatically loses their permanent resident status if they are outside of the country for a period surpassing two years. The documentary evidence is not specific and the factors surrounding recourse possibilities to appeal the decision for the loss of permanent residence are too hypothetical to consider that the appellants have the right to return to Brazil on the date of the hearing. Therefore, I am of the opinion that there is no possibility for the adult appellants to return to Brazil and that this is an unfavourable factor in terms of the exclusion, contrary to the RPD's conclusion indicating that this is a neutral factor.\n",
      "3- Risks that the appellants would be exposed to if they returned to Haiti\n",
      "[20] The RPD was of the view that, on a balance of probabilities, the principal appellant established the veracity of certain allegations found in his written account surrounding incidents that took place in Haiti. The RPD was also of the opinion that, on a balance of probabilities, the associate appellant's house was completely destroyed by a fire in 2012. However, it was not established that, on a balance of probabilities, the fire was caused by the criminals. It concluded that the appellants failed to establish at the hearing that, on a balance of probabilities, there is a personal prospective risk. Furthermore, danger is a factor that is generally faced by the entire Haitian population. The RPD concluded that the absence of a prospective fear weighs in favour of the application of Article 1E of the Convention. \n",
      "[21] In their appeal memorandum, the appellants argue that the RPD erred when it concluded that there was no prospective risk. To say the least, this conclusion is surprising considering the objective evidence, but it is also surprising in terms of the situation that is prevailing in Haiti. The appellants point out that after lifting the moratorium on deportations to Haiti, the Government of Canada once again established that the situation in Haiti is deteriorating every day. Even at the time of the RPD hearing, the situation in Haiti was far from improving. Now that the appellants have lived outside of the country, their prospective risk is even higher because they would be perceived as wealthy people.\n",
      "[22] I note that when the principal appellant was asked whether the criminals continued to occupy the confiscated land, he answered that he did not know and did not seek information on that matter because he had already lost his father.5 In response to the RPD's explanation of its prospective risk assessment conducted on the day of the hearing, the principal appellant declared that his risk was related to the danger in the country. He stated that he did not ask whether the criminals were still actively looking for him because it was useless given that the criminals had already committed their crime.6 When asked how the criminals would be able to find him if he established himself in the city of Cayes, he responded with the following:7\n",
      "[translation] \n",
      "OK. For example, if I go to Carnaval, the TV will...will capture me, the camera for...for television will capture my picture. And I cannot hide. And they will broadcast it. And everyone will...That will be stressful for me. I cannot make a future for my children there...\n",
      "[23] The associate appellant stated that the country was in bad shape, that her house had been set on fire, and that if her husband was facing problems, she could face problems as well.8 She claimed that she was in contact with her family, but that she did not ask about the criminals. I am of the opinion that the adult appellants' statements regarding their fears are actually connected to the danger in Haiti. Although the RPD found that appellants' allegations regarding certain incidents that the principal appellant's family endured in the past to be credible, the appellants were unable to demonstrate that, on a balance of probabilities, the criminals are still looking for them.\n",
      "[24] I note that the appellants did not allege that they would personally be subjected to a risk if they returned to Haiti, despite the fact that the RPD questioned them on this matter. They made reference to the lack of security in the country.\n",
      "[25] Concerning the house fire in 2012 and although the panel was of the opinion that, on a balance of probabilities, the associate appellant's house was entirely destroyed by the fire in question, it was not established that, on a balance of probabilities, this fire was caused by the criminals.\n",
      "[26] Concerning their allegations that they would be perceived as wealthy people, I note that being rich or being perceived as such is not considered a particular social group pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).9 In Jean,10 referring to Haitian nationals claiming a fear of returning to the country after a stay abroad, Justice Shore states that: \"...the diaspora as a whole cannot be considered a 'risk group' and that each case must be considered, 'individually and within its own context.\" \n",
      "[27] To allow a claim under section 97 of the IRPA, refugee protection claimants must establish that the risk to which they would be subjected should they return is a personal risk. Moreover, this personal risk must be different from the generalized risk that other citizens in the country must face. In Prophète,11 Justice Tremblay-Lamer declared that: \"While a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, all Haitians are at risk of becoming the victims of violence.\"\n",
      "[28] In this country where violence is endemic, the fear of being kidnapped, robbed or extorted is a risk faced by the population as a whole, independent of gender and social class, and is consequently a \"generalized risk.\" Kidnappings are part of everyday life for Haitian people, regardless of their age, gender or wealth. \n",
      "[29] For all the above reasons, I cannot conclude that the RPD erred when it concluded that the appellants failed to discharge their burden of proof, pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA and for this reason.\n",
      "4- Canada's international obligations and other relevant factors\n",
      "[30] The RPD considered all of the relevant factors in light of the evidence, as well as Canada's international obligations, namely those of persons in need of protection by reasons of their fear of persecution pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and those who would be personally subjected to a risk pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n",
      "[31] In their appeal memorandum, the appellants argue that applying the exclusion is equivalent to Canada not respecting its international commitments or the objectives found in the third section of the IRPA. \n",
      "[32] I note that the purpose of Article 1E was succinctly articulated by the Court of Appeal in Zeng:\n",
      "[1]   This appeal concerns Section E of Article 1 (Article 1E) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U.N.T.S. 150 (the Convention) and more particularly, the issue of asylum shopping. Article 1E is an exclusion clause. It precludes the conferral of refugee protection if an individual has surrogate protection in a country where the individual enjoys substantially the same rights and obligations as nationals of that country. Asylum shopping refers to circumstances where an individual seeks protection in one country, from alleged persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual punishment in another country (the home country), while entitled to status in a \"safe\" country (the third country).\n",
      "[33] In this case, the RPD weighed the factors identified in Zeng and rightfully concluded that the adult appellants should be refused refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention. For the reasons above, I conclude that the RPD did not err when it rejected the adult appellants' refugee protection claim because they are excluded.\n",
      "The associate appellant (minor child) ? citizen of Brazil\n",
      "[34] At the hearing, the principal appellant declared that since he himself was a victim of discrimination, his son would also face discrimination. He also stated that his son would not be able to live on his own. The associate appellant reiterated her husband's concerns regarding discrimination and mentioned problems surrounding his race, finding a place to live, finding a job, as well being mistreated at school because of the colour of his skin.\n",
      "[35] The RPD was of the view that there were no other reasons provided to the panel as to why the minor child would be subjected to a risk in Brazil. It was of the opinion that Brazil is a solid democracy with a high level of institutionalization. The RPD was also of the view that, if necessary, the minor child could access these institutions and, therefore, receive adequate operational protection, if need be. The presumption of state protection was not rebutted. Therefore, no credible evidence was presented to demonstrate that the minor child would be subjected to a serious possibility of harm that would be equivalent to persecution, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subjected to a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of being subjected to torture if he were to return to Brazil. \n",
      "[36] In their appeal memorandum, the appellants argue that the best interest of the minor children is to be with their parents and that their parents' risk also subjects their lives to those risks.\n",
      "[37] The principal appellant testified that his son would face discrimination in Brazil due to the fact that he would be identified as the son of Haitian parents. He made references to difficulties with regard to finding a job or finding somewhere to live. The associate appellant testified that her son would be discriminated against because of the colour of his skin.12 I am of the opinion that these discrimination allegations do not amount to persecution and I agree with the RPD on this matter. With regard to the best interest of the minor child, the Federal Court ruled that the separation of family members does not amount to persecution, to a danger of being subjected to torture, to a personal threat to life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment.13 As a result, the alleged separation cannot in itself establish the refugee protection claim pursuant to section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. \n",
      "The associate appellant (minor child) ? citizen of the United States\n",
      "[38] The minor appellant is a citizen of the United States. Apart from the family being separated, the appellants did not submit any evidence against this country.14\n",
      "[39] I agree with the RPD's conclusion that the minor child would not be subjected to a serious possibility of harm that would be equivalent to persecution or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would not be subjected to a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of torture in the United States. With regard to the best interest of the child, I refer to paragraph 37, which addressed this matter. \n",
      "[40] Therefore, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err when it rejected the minor children's refugee protection claims because they are not \"Convention refugees\" or \"persons in need of protection.\"\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[41] I confirm the determination that the principal appellant and the associate appellant are excluded under Article 1E of the Convention.\n",
      "[42] I confirm the RPD's determination that the associate appellants (the minor children) are not \"Convention refugees\" or \"persons in need of protection.\"\n",
      "[43] The appeal is dismissed.\n",

      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] The principal appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the associated appellant, XXXX XXXX, are both citizens of Haiti. XXXX XXXX XXXX, the minor appellant, is a citizen of the United States. The principal appellant states that, after he was involved in a motorcycle accident in XXXX 2014, he suffered reprisals for nearly killing the other driver. The associated appellant claims that she was raped during a kidnapping in XXXX 2014. XXXX XXXX XXXX, the appellants' minor son, did not mention any fear or risk of returning to the United States.\n",
      "[2] The appellants are appealing against the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) finding that they were not credible and that they would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Haiti.\n",
      "[3] The appellants submit that the RPD breached the principles of natural justice by not allowing them to testify together because their children were present. The appellants add that the RPD was overly vigilant, conducted a microscopic examination of the evidence and failed to consider all the evidence. The appellants also criticize the RPD for not having correctly applied the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.1 Finally, they submit that the associated appellant would be a woman at risk if she had to return to Haiti because she would be identified with the diaspora and that she would no longer be able to access the same resources that she had prior to leaving.\n",
      "[4] The determinative issue on appeal for the principal appellant is his credibility. The determinative issue on appeal for the associated appellant is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution based on her membership in the particular social group of Haitian women.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[5] The appeal is allowed in part. I am of the opinion that the RPD erred by rejecting XXXX XXXX claim. However, I uphold the RPD's decision and confirm that it did not err by rejecting the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[6] I conducted an independent analysis of all the evidence on the record, after listening carefully to the hearing, to form my own opinion about this refugee protection claim and apply the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution to determine whether the decision rendered by the RPD was correct.\n",
      "The Refugee Protection Division did not fail to observe the principles of natural justice\n",
      "[7] In their memorandum, the appellants submit that the RPD breached its obligations of natural justice by having them testify separately. They state that their counsel did not warn them about the RPD's practice with respect to having young children at a hearing and did not decline the RPD's suggestion to have them testify separately. This allegedly upset the appellants, which kept them from concentrating on their testimonies.\n",
      "[8] With respect, listening to the recording of the hearing shows that the situation did not unfold as the appellants claim. Their counsel had warned them that having their young children there was not recommended, and they agreed to take turns testifying.\n",
      "[9] During the hearing, the member noted that the appellants' young children were in the room and told them that the RPD's practice is that children under 12 years of age do not attend hearings. She subsequently addressed the appellants' counsel by stating: [translation] \"I imagine that you discussed it with your clients. What do you suggest?\" The appellants' lawyer replied: [translation] \"Yes. They will take turns testifying. The person who is not testifying will take care of the children outside.\"2\n",
      "[10] The appellants' Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) indicates that an interpreter was not required during this hearing. That said, an interpreter was requested on the day of the hearing, and the RPD ensured that a translator was present. Once the interpreter arrived, the RPD summarized the administrative items that the appellants had discussed with their counsel, including their counsel's suggestion to have them testify separately. To that end, the member asked them: [translation] \"I would like to confirm that you agree to having your testimonies heard in turn.\" The associated appellant responded: [translation] \"Yes, because our lawyer already told us that. Unfortunately, we could not find anyone to take care of our children.\"3\n",
      "[11] It was not the RPD [translation] \"that chose\" to have the appellants take turns testifying. The RPD did not suggest it either. The RPD confirmed with the appellants that they had agreed to be heard in turn. Therefore, the RPD did not breach the principles of natural justice.\n",
      "The Refugee Protection Division did not err in assessing the male appellant's credibility\n",
      "[12] The RPD found that the male appellant was not credible because he had provided several versions of the accident that occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and had contradicted himself a number of times during his oral testimony. In his memorandum, the male appellant submits that the RPD conducted a microscopic analysis of the evidence, was overly vigilant and did not consider any of his explanations.\n",
      "\tContradictions in the male appellant's testimony\n",
      "[13] It was reasonable for the RPD to find that the principal appellant was not credible because the contradictions pertain to determinative elements of his refugee protection claim, and he failed to provide a valid explanation to clarify them.\n",
      "[14] The RPD asked the male appellant to explain why he states in his initial BOC Form that he spoke to police officers at the scene of the accident, even though the amended version indicates that he left the scene before they had arrived. The male appellant provided a third version of the events that he left the scene shortly after the police officers had arrived. When the RPD then asked him several times how these versions could be reconciled, the male appellant did not provide a valid explanation. He ducked the question by stating the following twice: [translation] \"I was there during the accident, but I left the scene later\" and \"the son of the man, who hit my motorcycle, has a lot of friends who are criminals.\"4\n",
      "[15] Another significant contradiction that is central to the male appellant's refugee protection claim concerns what happened immediately after the accident. In his amended BOC Form, the male appellant states that when he returned home, his father, who thought that he had died, told him that criminals had dropped by the home and were looking for him. During the hearing, the male appellant testified that he had gone home after the accident, took medication and that the criminals visited his father only later that same day while he went to visit his aunt. The RPD confronted him with this contradiction several times during the hearing. Instead of reconciling these contradictory versions or explaining them, the male appellant ducked the question by stating that [translation] \"after the accident, the other man had many friends who were criminals.\"5\n",
      "[16] It is not necessary to go over all the other contradictions because I find that the aforementioned contradictions concern determinative elements that are central to the male appellant's refugee protection claim, and accordingly, I find that the male appellant is not credible.\n",
      "[17] Therefore, the RPD did not err in assessing the male appellant's credibility.\n",
      "[18] The male appellant failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to torture, a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Haiti.\n",
      "The Refugee Protection Division did not correctly analyze the associated appellant's fear\n",
      "[19] The RPD found that the associated appellant was not credible because of contradictions and inconsistencies in the central elements of her refugee protection claim. In their memorandum, the appellants submit that the RPD minimized the associated appellant's objective fear. They add that the RPD incorrectly concluded that the associated appellant's prospective fear of persecution was reduced by the fact that she did not have a precarious economic situation or live in a poor neighbourhood. Lastly, they submit that the associated appellant would not be able to count on the resources that she had in the past if they were to return to Haiti.\n",
      "[20] With respect, I find that the contradictions and inconsistencies raised by the RPD in the associated appellant's testimony do not pertain to the central elements of her refugee protection claim. In addition, when the information chart in the Chairperson's Guideline 4 is applied, the female appellant's testimony is not only credible, but also consistent with that of a person who has been subjected to sexual violence. Lastly, the RPD criticizes the associated appellant for \"contradictions\" that undermine her credibility, but in analyzing the record, I must note that the associated appellant is criticized for having provided a more detailed oral testimony than her written testimony.\n",
      "\tFailure to state that she was blindfolded\n",
      "[21] In its decision, the RPD criticizes the associated appellant for failing to mention in her written testimony that, besides having her hands tied and her mouth [translation] \"covered\" when she was kidnapped, her attackers had allegedly blindfolded her as well. During the hearing, when describing her attack, the female appellant mentioned that she had been blindfolded when she was taken.6 When the RPD asked her why this information had not been included in her BOC Form, the female appellant responded that she had not included all the details about what had happened in her BOC Form. I find that this explanation is acceptable, and I do not draw a negative inference from the fact that this information was not included in the female appellant's BOC Form.\n",
      "\tThe behaviour of the female appellant's father-in-law after she had been kidnapped\n",
      "[22] In its decision, the RPD criticizes the female appellant for not answering the question about what her father-in-law did when he saw her being kidnapped and drew a negative inference with regard to her credibility as a result.\n",
      "[23] I find it difficult to blame a refugee protection claimant for not knowing what other people allegedly did or did not do. When asked what her father-in-law did after she had been kidnapped, the female appellant stated several times that he had filed a complaint with the police. When the RPD rephrased the question by raising their voice, the associated appellant stated that she had no idea at the time of the incident.7\n",
      "[24] I understand that the RPD remained confused by the lack of immediate intervention by the female appellant's father-in-law when she was kidnapped. I am as well. That said, the associated appellant, who had just been kidnapped and sexually assaulted, cannot be held responsible for asking about her father-in-law's behaviour after this incident. Fear causes significant paralysis, and even if this behaviour may seem illogical to North Americans, the situation in Haiti is quite different.\n",
      "[25] The RPD also criticizes the female appellant for failing to mention in the first version of her BOC Form that she had spoken to her father-in-law about the rape and that he had filed a complaint with the police on her behalf. During the hearing, the associated appellant explained that she had asked to amend her BOC Form to include this information after noticing that it had not been included in the first version of the BOC Form.8 Once again, this explanation seems valid to me.\n",
      "\tContradiction between the Basis of Claim Form and testimony: Call to parents\n",
      "[26] The female appellant was accused of another contradiction, namely, having amended her BOC Form to state that the kidnappers had allegedly called her parents, instead of her parents reportedly running into the kidnappers in trying to reach her.\n",
      "[27] During the hearing, when the RPD asked her why she had made that change, the associated appellant replied that it was because she had noticed mistakes in the translation of her testimony during a meeting with her lawyer and had asked for the BOC Form to be amended to correct it.9 The RPD did not seem to be satisfied and asked many questions about how the attackers were allegedly able to call her parents. The associated appellant responded that her mother's name appears under \"mommy\" in her telephone and that the attackers must have figured out that it was her mother from there.10\n",
      "[28] The associated appellant also indicates that the attackers called her parents to ask them for money.11 She explains that she could not hear everything, but that she was scared because she knew that they would not be able to pay the ransom and feared for her life.\n",
      "[29] Contrary to the RPD's finding, the associated appellant's testimony is credible. She testified about her kidnapping and sexual assault by including a variety of convincing and spontaneous details. The associated appellant provided a direct testimony on the actions of her agents of persecution and her mental and physical state during and after the attack. Based on my own independent assessment, I find that the associated appellant's testimony was detailed, spontaneous and credible.\n",
      "[30] Although the RPD mentions Guideline 4 briefly in its reasons, it did not address them in a significant way before rejecting the female appellant's testimony as not credible. Guideline 4 indicates that women survivors of sexual violence may exhibit symptoms of Rape Trauma Syndrome, including self-blame. It is deplorable that neither the RPD nor her counsel offered the associated appellant a break until the interpreter had asked if she was okay, even though that was clearly not the case.12\n",
      "[31] The female appellant's testimony about her kidnapping and sexual assault is convincing and consistent with the symptoms of Rape Trauma Syndrome, which is described in Guideline 4.\n",
      "[32] The female appellant testified that she assumes responsibility for what happened to her and blames herself for the attackers' actions. For example, in referring to her kidnapping, she stated that she had put herself in a situation that she did not understand, blamed herself for having further angered her attackers by speaking to them in Spanish, which allegedly led them to beat her more.13\n",
      "[33] The differences between the information in the female appellant's BOC Form and her testimony at the hearing and the lack of detail about the context of the rape may be explained by the trauma that was caused by her sexual assault. The RPD had to take this into consideration, as set out in the Chairperson's Guideline 4.\n",
      "[34] The RPD erred by finding that the female appellant's testimony was not credible.\n",
      "\tThe Refugee Protection Division's conclusion regarding the minutes\n",
      "[35] During the hearing, the RPD indicated its concerns about the two versions of the minutes from the peace court registry that were filed by the female appellant, which recount the incidents that occurred from XXXX XXXX to XXXX, 2014. The RPD explained that the first document is dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, which is prior to the incidents. The amended version of the minutes indicates that the document is dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014.\n",
      "[36] In its decision, the RPD states that when she was confronted with this contradiction during the hearing, the female appellant explained that her father-in-law had asked for a second copy of the minutes. The RPD found that this explanation was unreasonable, that the female appellant was unable to explain how the document would have been corrected and therefore gave no probative value to those documents.\n",
      "[37] With respect, I disagree with the RPD because the female appellant explained during the hearing how the document had been corrected. Listening carefully to the hearing demonstrates that when the RPD asked the female appellant [translation] \"How can a judge make a date error in an official document?,\" she explained that she had noticed the mistake and that is exactly why she had asked for an amendment. She explained that her father-in-law had obtained an amended copy of the minutes.14 I find that this explanation is completely valid, and I have no other reason to believe that these documents are not genuine. Even judges, however knowledgeable as they may be, can make mistakes in official documents.\n",
      "[38] The RPD erred by finding that the minutes were not reliable documents.\n",
      "The prospective risk\n",
      "[39] In my opinion, there is a serious possibility of persecution for the female appellant as a member of the particular social group of Haitian women, and in particular, the sub-group of women survivors of sexual violence.\n",
      "[40] The RPD concludes that the female appellant would not face more than a mere possibility of persecution by reason of her membership in the group of Haitian women if she were to return to live in Haiti. The RPD states that the following factors specific to the female appellant would reduce her fear of being a victim of sexual violence:\n",
      "- She could benefit from male protection in Haiti;\n",
      "- she would have her family's support; and\n",
      "- she does not have the profile of a person who is alone and without support.\n",
      "[41] In their memorandum, the appellants submit that, if she had to return to Haiti, the female appellant would be in danger because she would be identified with the diaspora and was already kidnapped and sexually assaulted. They also note that the reasons cited by the RPD to mitigate the female appellant's prospective risk are wrong.\n",
      "[42] I disagree with the RPD's conclusion that the female appellant does not have the profile of a Haitian woman who has a serious possibility of being harmed because of her membership in the group of Haitian women for the following reasons.\n",
      "      Objective situation in Haiti\n",
      "[43] Although the document titled HTI106291.FE: Violence, including sexual violence, against women, which is included at Tab 5.3 of the National Documentation Package on Haiti and published on June 14, 2019, has been updated since the RPD's decision, most of the information that it contains was in the previous version. Among other things, this document indicates that violence against women is a \"widespread\" problem in Haiti, and statistics show that it is on the rise.15 This insecurity, which is mainly due to the Haitian authorities' inability to prevent and punish violence against women, is exacerbated by a dysfunctional judicial system that fosters impunity for the perpetrators at the expense of protecting survivors of sexual violence.16\n",
      "[44] This same document states that the police rarely investigate cases of violence against women and report on the situation, difficulties and obstacles faced by survivors of sexual violence who try to obtain help. Some sources state that:\n",
      "... gender-based inequalities, religion that encourages the submission of the woman to her husband, fear of reprisals for victims and their family in the absence of the availability of protection, difficulty accessing services that are provided more by civil society than by the state, lack of competence of police and justice services personnel, the fees associated with legal proceedings and the lack of effective legal aid mechanisms, difficulty in accessing the courts (also since [translation] \"non-central regions have limited or no coverage\"), the use of French as the language of justice in a country where [translation] \"80 percent of the population speaks only Creole,\" and the tendency of judges to encourage out-of-court agreements rather than investigations. The OFPRA also mentions legal fees, the language barrier, the fear of reprisals and gender discrimination.17\n",
      "[45] The documentary evidence also mentions that the authorities discourage sexual violence complaints and that officers frequently blame the victims and \"routinely ask\" victims what they did or what they were wearing to provoke such an attack.18 This document also includes many examples of the authorities, rather than just police officers, refusing to investigate. Discriminatory and sexist treatment by representatives of the prosecutor's office also exists.19\n",
      "[46] With respect to support for victims of sexual violence, the report from the Office français de la protection des réfugiés et apatrides at Tab 2.520 states that, even if there is recourse for victims of sexual violence, it is difficult for some of them to become immune to these attacks because they do not have access to it: [translation] \"if a woman is unaware of the support networks and does not have appropriate contacts in her community, it is difficult for her to protect herself from sexual violence.\"\n",
      "      The female appellant's age and autonomy\n",
      "[47] In the female appellant's case, her age and presumed autonomy are not factors that, even if we were to assume that they were present, would mitigate the risk of being subjected to sexual violence if she were to return to Haiti. The documentary evidence states that, in addition to the physical and psychological consequences that she has already suffered as a survivor of sexual violence, there is a serious possibility that the female appellant would be stigmatized by her community and her family. This would make her even more vulnerable and at risk of sexual violence.21\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been subjected to sexual violence in the past is a factor that increases the risks of suffering sexual violence in the future\n",
      "[48] Like all Haitian women, the female appellant would face generalized violence against women if she were to return to Haiti. What is specific to her is that, like other survivors of sexual violence, they are often stigmatized by their community and more at risk of being subjected to further violence.22\n",
      "[49] The report from the U.S. Department of State concerning the human rights situation in Haiti23 states that the judicial system is ineffective, unreliable and inconsistent and that sexual violence and gender-based violence are chronic problems. Furthermore, the justice system made it difficult for survivors to seek redress because a fear of reprisals and social stigma contributed to under-reporting and infrequent prosecutions. It also states that survivors faced major obstacles in seeking justice and accessing protective services such as women's shelters.\n",
      "[50] At Tab 5.5, the report on sexual violence by the Doctors Without Borders organization states the following:\n",
      "The proximity to the attackers often prevents victims from going home in their communities after the rape because they are at risk of further violence, stigma, and sometimes reprisals.24\n",
      "[51] Survivors of sexual violence who try to file a complaint against their attackers must not only overcome difficulties and obstacles, but they must also deal with the stigmatizing attitudes of the police and judicial authorities:\n",
      "34. Public officials in the justice system (often males) who interact with female victims of gender-based violence frequently have attitudes that perpetuate the stigma associated with rape and obstruct female victims' access to justice, which includes police, prosecutors and judges. The negative attitudes of the police towards victims discourage reporting instances of gender-based violence. Furthermore, the discriminatory or sexist form and attitude of some police officers when they receive complainants at the station re-traumatizes the victims and dissuade them from reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "35. Some investigatory judges blame the victim for having done something to attract the aggression or trivialize the experience. In one harrowing case, a young woman was repeatedly badgered with the question, \"What did you do to make him violate you?\" In that case, the victim spent more than 24 hours travelling from police stations to state hospitals and clinics, trying to register her complaint and obtain a medical certificate, as the officers mistakenly demanded medical certificates to open investigations or press charges, refusing to write up the rape allegation until she paid a bribe.\n",
      "\n",
      "36. A 2012 study found that \"[m]ore than half of sexual assault victims and household members who tried to report the crime to the police complained that officers refused to make a report or tried to dissuade the victim or family members from doing so. Roughly 12 percent of sexual assault victims reported paying or being asked for bribes by police; the average bribe given was 1200 gourdes, about USD $30.25\n",
      "[52] The documentary evidence states that communities often exacerbate the situation of sexual violence victims by stigmatizing or rejecting them. It states that raped women are often [translation] \"considered to be guilty by their relatives, who punish them by mistreating them.\"26\n",
      "[53] Lastly, even when some victims of sexual violence manage to receive support from an association, it does not help them to reintegrate into their community or obtain protection from threats in their community.27\n",
      "\tMale protection in Haiti\n",
      "[54] In its decision, the RPD states that one of the factors specific to the female appellant that would reduce her risk of being a victim of sexual violence in Haiti is that she could benefit from male protection. The evidence on the record does establish that the principal appellant is married.\n",
      "[55] However, in the context of targeted and generalized violence against women that exists in Haiti, I am of the opinion that the mere fact that a woman is married or can live with a man is not a factor that reduces the risk of being subjected to sexual violence. Sexual violence does not discriminate against victims who have a partner from those who do not. Therefore, in her memorandum, the female appellant is correct in stating that family support would not prevent the risk of being subjected to sexual violence in Haiti. Moreover, the fact that a woman can live with a man in Haiti is not equivalent to the protection that the state authorities are expected to provide to their citizens.\n",
      "[56] It is also important to note that the documentary evidence does not indicate that living with a male member of the same family is an important factor in reducing the possibility of being a victim of sexual violence. Rather, it states that the \"availability of protection\" can limit the risk of reprisals when a victim files a complaint against her aggressor(s).28 In my opinion, it is an error to frame male presence as a factor mitigating future risks of sexual violence, as the RPD did.\n",
      "[57] In addition to not being a factor that reduces the risk of being subjected to sexual violence, I note that in the vast majority of cases, this violence is not anonymous; it is perpetrated by a spouse. In 58% of cases, the victim's current spouse or partner commits the sexual violence, and in 83% of cases, it is a man whom she knows:\n",
      "The survey data shows that in 58 percent of cases, the perpetrator of the violence is the victim's current husband or partner, and in 37 percent of cases, it is the former husband or partner; among victims who are single, in 34 percent of cases it is a boyfriend, in 20 percent of cases it is a friend of the family and in 17 percent of cases it is an unknown individual.29\n",
      "[58] Based on the above analysis, the state does not provide any protection to women victims of sexual violence in Haiti. Within that context, there is no internal flight alternative.\n",
      "[59] For these reasons, I find that the female appellant is credible with respect to her fear of being persecuted by reason of her membership in the group of Haitian women. I am also of the opinion that there is a serious possibility that the female appellant would be persecuted and subjected to sexual violence if she were to return to Haiti.\n",
      "[60] The RPD erred by concluding that the female appellant had failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of her membership in the particular social group of Haitian women.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\tXXXX XXXX XXXX fear\n",
      "[61] No evidence was submitted on the appellants' minor son with respect to his country of birth, the United States. Therefore, it is not established that he would face a serious possibility of being persecuted in the United States or that he could be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n",
      "[62] The RPD did not err by determining that the minor appellant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[63] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD's determination regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, namely, that they are neither refugees nor persons in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed in their cases.\n",
      "[64] However, I set aside the RPD's determination and substitute a determination that should have been made with respect to XXXX XXXXXXXX, namely, that she is Convention refugee. The appeal is allowed in her case.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX (the principal Appellant), XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, (the associate Appellants), are citizens of Bangladesh who allegedly fear an Islamist political party called the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI). The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denied their claims in a decision dated January 27, 2021, after finding that they have an internal flight alternative (IFA) in the city of Dhaka. They appeal the RPD's decision to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).1\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[2] The appeal is dismissed. I confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor  persons in need of protection.2\n",
      "SUMMARY OF THE FACTS\n",
      "[3] The Appellants are a family from Chittagong, Bangladesh, and include the principal Appellant, his wife, and their six-year-old son. The principal Appellant alleges that members of the JI have been extorting his parents and siblings since the 1990s in the form of forced donations to the political party because they are Buddhists who are perceived to be well off.\n",
      "[4] The principal Appellant left Bangladesh to work in Indonesia in 2001, where he established a XXXX business 2007. He returned periodically to Bangladesh to visit his parents throughout the years, but was not approached by the JI until his wedding in 2011. He paid the JI 100,000 Bangladeshi taka to ensure that his wedding was not interrupted. A year later, the JI attacked and damaged his parents' home. He travelled back and forth from Indonesia to Bangladesh from 2014 to 2016 to help his parents build a new home, but was approached by members of the JI who demanded money \"saying that since we had money for a new house we had to pay them donations.\"\n",
      "[5] The two associate Appellant's returned to Bangladesh in 2014, where they remained until 2017, while the principal Appellant worked in Indonesia. On July 20, 2017, the female associate Appellant was pulled out a rickshaw by three men who asked whether she was the principal Appellant's wife. Her clothing was ripped in the process, but she managed to escape when a passerby intervened. The associate Appellants left for Indonesia following this incident.\n",
      "[6] The Appellants returned to Bangladesh in XXXX 2018 to care for the principal Appellant's ailing father, and were again extorted 100,000 taka. They left for Indonesia in XXXX 2018, but returned to Bangladesh for one week in XXXX 2018, at which point the JI demanded one million taka.\n",
      "[7] The Appellants entered Canada with visas which they obtained after the female associate Appellant was admitted to a college, and filed their claims for refugee protection on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.\n",
      "ISSUES\n",
      "[8] The determinative issue in this appeal is the viability of an IFA in Dhaka.\n",
      "[9] The Appellants have not submitted new evidence on appeal.\n",
      "ROLE OF THE RAD\n",
      "[10] The standard of correctness applies to this appeal according to Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica.3 This requires an independent assessment of the refugee claims to determine whether the RPD was correct in its findings and determinations. While deference can be afforded to the RPD on specific issues when it enjoys a meaningful advantage over the RAD in making findings of fact or mixed fact and law, such an advantage does not arise in the present case.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[11] After considering the Appellants' arguments and conducting an independent assessment of the entire record, which includes the transcript of the proceeding before the RPD, I agree with the RPD that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Dhaka.\n",
      "[12] Refugee claimants are expected to seek protection in another part of their own country, if it is available, before they seek refuge in Canada.4 The notion of an IFA is inherent in the definition of a Convention refugee because refugee protection is a form of surrogate protection.5 Accordingly, the Appellants bear the onus of demonstrating that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, including the area identified as an IFA.6\n",
      "[13] The analysis for assessing an IFA has two parts according to the Federal Court in Rasaratnam.7 I must first determine whether there is a serious possibility that the Appellants will be persecuted, or whether they will face, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to their lives, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Dhaka. Secondly, I must also be satisfied, after considering the Appellants' individual circumstances and the conditions in the proposed IFA, that it would not be unreasonable to seek refuge in Dhaka. An IFA will only be viable if both criteria are met.8\n",
      "There is no serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm in Dhaka\n",
      "[14] The Appellants have a viable IFA in Dhaka where they do not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm. An IFA analysis requires a contextual approach, looking at the profile of the agents of harm, their motivation to search for the Appellants, and their ability to locate them. There can only be a serious possibility of persecution if the agents of harm have both the \"means and the motivation\" to search for and locate the Appellants.9\n",
      "[15] The evidence does not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that members of the JL, as the agents of harm, have the motivation to search for the Appellants and pursue them throughout Bangladesh, and in Dhaka in particular. The Appellants' problems with the JI relate to the longstanding extortion of the principal Appellant's family in Chittagong, where all of the alleged incidents occurred. According to the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP), the city of Chittagong is the second-largest city in Bangladesh and one of the historical strongholds of the JI.10 The principal Appellant testified that his parents never considered leaving Chittagong to relocate to another part of Bangladesh to avoid the JI \"[s]o to preserve the legacy of my paternal home. They were quite influential in the area, they owned a lot of property so they did not consider going anywhere else.\" Additionally, he testified that his brothers did not leave Chittagong because they never found job opportunities anywhere else.\n",
      "[16] The principal Appellant only faced problems from the JI during several of his periodic visits with his parents in Chittagong beginning in 2011. He confirmed in testimony that he did not personally experience problems with the JI outside of Chittagong.\n",
      "[17] When the two associate Appellants lived in Chittagong from 2014 to 2017, they only experienced problems with the JI when they associated with the principal Appellant's parents. According to the adult female Appellant's testimony, she returned to Bangladesh in 2014 to stay with her in-laws so that her mother-in-law can help her raise her son. She eventually left her in-law's home and moved in her parents in 2014 because of members of the JI continued to visit her in-laws. She confirmed in testimony that she did not experience any incidents at her parents' home in Chittagong during her almost three-year stay. The alleged incident on July 20, 2017, occurred to the adult female associate Appellant while she was enroute to visit her in-law in Chittagong.\n",
      "[18] The Appellants dispute the RPD's finding that the JI never actively searched for them during their stay in Dhaka from XXXX to XXXX 2018 by arguing that \"the panel did not mention that [the principal Appellant's] brother stated that when JI attacked him in March 2020 they stated that they were aware that [the principal Appellant] had tried to escape from them by staying in Dhaka.\" However, despite the indication in this letter that members of the JI were aware that the principal Appellant was in Dhaka, they did not display an interest in leaving Chittagong to pursue him in Dhaka, and instead demanded that his brother obtain funds for them. The principal Appellant's brother writes that members of the JI stated that \"we need money or [the principal Appellant]. If you can't collect any money from your brother then you have to arrange the money.\" I therefore do not agree with the Appellants' submission that the letter from the principal Appellant's brother displays the motivation of the agents of harm to search for them throughout Bangladesh and pursue them in Dhaka.\n",
      "[19] While the Appellants argue that the RPD erred by failing to refer to evidence in the NDP about the JI's \"network and its reach,\" such evidence pertains to the means available to the agents of harm and does not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they have the motivation to search for the Appellants throughout Bangladesh and pursue them in Dhaka.\n",
      "[20] For the reasons outlined above, I agree with the RPD that the Appellants \"faced threats from the JI only when they were in Chittagong, more specifically when they were at or near the principal claimant's parents' house.\" I am therefore satisfied that the first part of the tests from Rasaratnam has been met, and that the Appellants face neither a serious possibility of persecution, nor, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to their lives, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Dhaka.\n",
      "It is reasonable for the Appellant to relocate to Dhaka\n",
      "[21] I am satisfied that it is reasonable for the Appellants to relocate to Dhaka based on their specific circumstances and the objective evidence in the NDP. The Federal Court of Appeal has established, \"a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area.\"11\n",
      "[22] The RPD considered relevant factors which inform the analysis of whether Dhaka is a reasonable IFA in the Appellants' specific circumstances, including their level of education, work experience, language skills, and the existence of a Buddhist community. The Appellants have not challenged any of these specific findings. I have not identified any errors in the RPD's analysis in my independent assessment, and find that the RPD's determination is correct. Beyond the foregoing, I also note that the principal Appellant confirmed in testimony when asked by the RPD that he could live in Dhaka if he \"wouldn't have any problems with Jamaat-e-Islami.\"\n",
      "[23] I do not accept the argument that \"documented abuses against religious minorities all over Bangladesh is also a factor that makes relocating to Dhaka unreasonable for them.\" The population of Bangladesh is approximately 89% Muslim, 8% Hindu, and 3% Buddhist and Christian.12 Bangladesh is considered \"religiously diverse and religious minorities live throughout the country,\" with \"no legal or other restrictions preventing Buddhists, Christians or Hindus from freely practising their religion, accessing state schools, health or other government services.\"13 Indeed, \"[t]he constitution and other laws protect religious freedom and ensure equal status and equal rights in the practice of the Hindu, Buddhist, Christian and other religions.\"14 The objective evidence in the NDP notes some instances of communal violence, such as \"several small-scale localised attacks targeting minority religious groups and high-profile secular activities,\" and \"[s]ome Buddhists face occasional societal violence, the most serious of which occurred in 2012 ...\"15 However, United Kingdom Home Office observes that \"[i]n general, the level of societal discrimination faced by religious minorities is low and does not amount to a real risk of persecution and/or serious harm. Although there have outbreaks of communal violence and sporadic attacks by extremists, in general, these are not sufficiently serious by their nature and repetition as to amount to persecution or serious harm.\"16 Additionally, \"[t]he government continued to provide law enforcement personnel at religious sites, festivals, and events considered potential targets for violence, including the Hindu festival of Durga Puja, Christmas, Easter, and the Buddhist festival of Buddha Purnima...\"17 The objective evidence in the NDP therefore does not support a finding that Dhaka is an unreasonable IFA because of the Appellants' religion.\n",
      "[24] The Appellants have not pointed to any circumstances particular to the minor Appellant, including his age, that would make Dhaka an unreasonable IFA, and I have not identified any since he will be under the care and protection of his parents.\n",
      "[25] For all of the reasons outlined above, after considering the Appellants' personal circumstances and the objective evidence in the NDP, I am satisfied that the second part of the Rasaratnam test has been met and that it would not be objectively unreasonable in the circumstances for them to relocate to Dhaka.\n",
      "Nexus and procedural fairness\n",
      "[26] I acknowledge that the Appellants challenge the RPD's finding that they did not establish a nexus to one of the grounds of persecution in the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (\"Refugee Convention\").18 However, I do not need to address nexus because the question of IFA is integral to both the definition of a Convention refugee and that of a person in need of protection.19\n",
      "[27] Relatedly, I do not need to address the Appellants' argument that the RPD breached the principles of natural justice by making a finding on nexus without raising it as an issue and giving them an opportunity to respond. Any breach of the Appellants' right to procedural fairness was remedied by their submission to the RAD which addresses nexus.20\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[28] The RPD was correct in its determination that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Dhaka. I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.21\n",
