If forced to return to Nigeria, he fears he will be arbitrarily arrested, harmed, or killed by the Department of State Services (DSS) because he is a Christian XXXX who has criticized the Nigerian government. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) refused his claim for protection, finding XXXX XXXX XXXX would not face a future risk of persecution. XXXX XXXX XXXX challenges the RPD's findings.\n[2] I allow the appeal. I set aside the RPD's decision and substitute my own decision that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention1 refugee. I find XXXX XXXX XXXX faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria by reason of his political opinion. I accept XXXX XXXX XXXX claim based on his activities in Canada that have come to the attention of the Nigerian government. XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted new evidence to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) about these activities, which met the requirements for holding an oral hearing.\nBACKGROUND ALLEGATIONS\n[3] XXXX XXXX XXXX is the son of a Christian mother and a father who converted from Islam to Christianity. XXXX XXXX XXXX uncle also converted to Christianity. XXXX XXXX XXXX father faced repercussions for his conversion and was killed in front of XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2003. Witnessing his father's death caused XXXX XXXX XXXX to decide to serve God in his work. He became a Christian XXXX and was XXXX by the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion in 2008.\n[4] XXXX XXXX XXXX experienced threats from Muslim members of his village when he married his wife in 2010. He lived in fear. His wife and two children often lived with family and friends as XXXX XXXX XXXX travelled frequently for work. In XXXX 2013, XXXX XXXX XXXX was beaten in by unknown men in front of his wife and children. In XXXX 2015, XXXX XXXX XXXX vehicle was hit by a bus. XXXX XXXX XXXX recognized one of the men from the attack in XXXX 2013. XXXX XXXX XXXX discussed his situation with his uncle, as well as the increasing violence against Christians. His uncle assisted him in obtaining a student visa to the United States of America (USA). XXXX XXXX XXXX travelled to the USA in XXXX 2015 to attend XXXX XXXX in Massachusetts. XXXX XXXX XXXX third child was born after he left Nigeria.\n[5] XXXX XXXX XXXX uncle was killed shortly after he started studies in the USA. XXXX XXXX XXXX sought a leave of absence from his studies in 2016 and began volunteering as a XXXX in the Anglican Diocese of Texas. In XXXX 2017, XXXX XXXX XXXX learned of the ability to make a refugee claim in Canada for religious persecution. He travelled to Canada shortly after and made a claim for protection at an irregular border entry.\n[6] While in Canada, XXXX XXXX XXXX served at churches in Montreal and Toronto. He became a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, where he has instituted a Nigerian congregation. He has XXXX at churches across the greater Toronto area, as well as a church in Calgary.\n[7] The RPD heard XXXX XXXX XXXX claim on August 27, 2020. It refused his claim on September 13, 2020.\n[8] While waiting on a decision on his appeal, XXXX XXXX XXXX continued his work in Canada by XXXX in Canada at XXXX XXXX XXXX. His XXXX has included criticism of the government of Nigeria's response to violence against Christians. He has been vocal against the President of Nigeria, including an event in November 2020 titled \"Praying Buhari out of power - Nigerians in dispora [sic] must arise against Buhari a Fulani-herdsmen in disguise\", as well as events in 2021.\n[9] In XXXX 2021, the DSS visited XXXX XXXX XXXX wife's residence. They stated they knew about his activities in Canada embarrassing the Nigerian President and government. They told his wife they were monitoring his activities. They warned her to tell her husband to report himself to the police.\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY AT THE RAD\n[10] XXXX XXXX XXXX perfected his appeal on November 30, 2020. On March 16, 2021, the RAD put his appeal on hold pursuant to the Practice notice: RPD and RAD processing for individuals applying under government of Canada public policies.2 On October 14, 2021, the RAD sent notice to XXXX XXXX XXXX that it would resume processing his appeal after it was informed that his application under one of the public policies was refused.\n[11] XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted new evidence and submissions on December 10, 2021. The new evidence related to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada and how his activities had come to the attention of the Nigerian government. On May 6, 2022, I sent a notice that I would be holding an oral hearing. I identified the hearing would be limited to XXXX XXXX XXXX activities in Canada that had come to the attention of the Nigerian government and the new evidence submitted on December 10, 2021. Notice of the hearing and the issues were provided to the Minister.\n[12] The hearing was scheduled for July 15, 2022. Four days before the hearing, XXXX XXXX XXXX counsel made a request to remove himself as counsel of record. I allowed the request on July 12, 2022. The same day, XXXX XXXX XXXX provided additional new evidence with submissions and confirmed he would represent himself at the hearing. At the start of the hearing, I explained to XXXX XXXX XXXX that he had the right to be represented by counsel and that he could make an application to adjourn the hearing to find new representation, if needed. XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed he did not want to adjourn the hearing and was prepared to proceed without counsel. I was satisfied XXXX XXXX XXXX understood the purpose of the proceedings and was ready to proceed.\n[13] The Minister did not intervene before the RPD or the RAD and is therefore not a party to this appeal. In order to find XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee, I considered whether he has access to state protection or an internal flight alternative (IFA). As these issues were not addressed in the RPD reasons or directly addressed in the appeal, they are new issues. Further to the Federal Court's decision in Alazar,3 the RAD provided notice to the Minister and the Appellant on July 19, 2022 that it would be considering these issues, with any submissions from the Minister to be provided by August 2, 2022. The Minister did not provide any submissions. I therefore considered these issues based on the record before the RAD.\nNEW EVIDENCE & ORAL HEARING\n[14] When an Appellant submits new evidence after perfecting an appeal, the RAD considers the factors in Rule 29(4) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules).4 These factors include the document's relevance and probative value, any new evidence the document brings to the appeal, and whether the Appellant could have provided the document with the Appellant's Record. If these factors weigh in favour of admitting the new evidence, the RAD also considers the requirements of section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act5 (IRPA) and the newness, relevance, and credibility of the evidence.6\nNew evidence provided December 10, 2021\n[15] XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted the following evidence on December 10, 2021, with an application to accept new evidence after perfecting his appeal:\ni. Letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021;\nii. Affidavit of RBO (XXXX XXXX XXXX wife), sworn XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021;\niii. Letter from the XXXX XXXX of Nigeria, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021.\n[16] I admit the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church, the Affidavit of RBO, and the letter from the XXXX XXXX of Nigeria as new evidence.\n[17] The factors in Rule 29 of the RAD Rules weigh in favour of admission. The documents are highly relevant and probative, as they address the future risk XXXX XXXX XXXX may face in Nigeria. The documents describe events that happened after the RPD decision, so they bring new evidence to the appeal. Although the letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church and the XXXX XXXX of Nigeria describe an event that happened in the two weeks before the appeal was perfected (i.e. event on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020 and other events where XXXX XXXX XXXX was critical of the Nigerian government), I find the relevance of those events was only apparent after the DSS visited XXXX XXXX XXXX wife in XXXX 2021 stating they were aware of his activities in Canada. I agree with XXXX XXXX XXXX that this explains why the letters were not provided at the time the appeal was perfected in XXXX 2020. Where the documents describe events that happened after the appeal was perfected, this evidence could not have been provided with the Appellant's Record. XXXX XXXX XXXX has not raised any other factors for consideration and I see none arising. All of the factors weigh in favour of admitting this new evidence.\n[18] I find the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church and the Affidavit of RBO meet the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA and the documents are new, relevant, and credible. The evidence in the documents arose after the RPD's rejection of the claim. Likewise, the documents are new as they could prove facts that were unknown at the time of the RPD's rejection. The letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church indicates XXXX XXXX XXXX has been XXXX about issues in Nigeria and is critical of the President of Nigeria. The Affidavit from RBO states the DSS came to RBO's residence looking for XXXX XXXX XXXX because he is embarrassing and spreading false information about the Nigerian government. All of this evidence is relevant to the appeal, as it addresses the future risk XXXX XXXX XXXX may face in Nigeria. It is also relevant to my assessment of state protection and IFA. The letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church and the Affidavit of RBO are credible for the purposes of admission. The letter is on church letterhead and signed and sealed by the church's leader. The Affidavit of RBO conforms to country evidence about the issuance of affidavits by a court.\n[19] I also find the letter from the XXXX XXXX of Nigeria meets the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA and it is new, relevant, and credible. The evidence in the letter arose after the rejection of XXXX XXXX XXXX claim. The letter indicates XXXX XXXX XXXX has been critical of the Nigerian government and states the organization learned DSS agents visited XXXX XXXX XXXX wife's residence in Nigeria. This is relevant to the appeal as it addresses the future risk XXXX XXXX XXXX may face in Nigeria, including whether he has access to state protection or an internal flight alternative. I find the source and circumstance of the letter from the Christian Association of Nigeria meet the credibility threshold for the purposes of admission.\nOral hearing at the RAD\n[20] I found the new evidence submitted December 10, 2021 justified holding an oral hearing. The new evidence submitted on July 12 and 15, 2022, discussed below, did not factor into my decision to hold an oral hearing because it was received after I made that decision.\n[21] The RAD may hold an oral hearing if there is new evidence that raises a serious issue of credibility with the person who is the subject of the appeal, that is central to the decision of the claim, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim.7\n[22] The credibility of the events described in the new evidence (the topics of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada and the DSS visiting his wife's residence because of his XXXX) is intrinsically linked to XXXX XXXX XXXX credibility. I need to find XXXX XXXX XXXX credible to find these events happened as he alleged. I find the new evidence requires me to re-assess XXXX XXXX XXXX general credibility in light of the new evidence. The credibility of these allegations is also central to the claim and, if accepted, would justify allowing the appeal. These new allegations could refute the RPD's conclusion that XXXX XXXX XXXX does not face a future risk of persecution in Nigeria. The new allegations would also impact the possibility of state protection or an IFA since the state would be one of the agents of persecution.\n[23] I therefore found the new evidence met the requirements in section 110(6) of the IRPA and I exercised my discretion to hold a hearing. The hearing took place on July 15, 2022.\nAdditional new evidence and submissions provided July 12 and 15, 2022\n[24] XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted the following evidence on July 12, 2022, with an application to accept new evidence after perfecting his appeal:\ni. Flyer from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church, advertising XXXX XXXX XXXX would be XXXXaXXXX XXXXon XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, titled \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - Nigerians in dispora [sic] must arise against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in disguise\";\nii. Text messages between XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Church, from XXXX XXXXto XXXX XXXX 2022, showing XXXX XXXX XXXX requests for the above flyer.\n[25] In response to a question at the hearing, XXXX XXXX XXXX showed a flyer from XXXX XXXX GTA (XXXX of Nigeria), from an event in XXXX 2019. He explained that he has XXXX at churches in different cities in Canada, including XXXX XXXX GTA (XXXX of Nigeria) in the greater Toronto area. I asked XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide a copy of the flyer to the RAD, which he did on July 15, 2022.\n[26] I admit the flyer from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church, the text messages, and the flyer from XXXX XXXX GTA (XXXX of Nigeria) as new evidence.\n[27] The factors in Rule 29 of the RAD Rules weigh in favour of admission. The flyers are relevant and probative, as they confirm XXXX XXXX XXXX has XXXX publicly, including about his criticisms of the Nigerian President and government. The flyer from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church describes an event that happened after the RPD decision, so brings new evidence to the appeal. The text messages provide relevant and probative information about the origin of the flyer from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church. The flyer from XXXX XXXX GTA (XXXX of Nigeria) brings new evidence to the appeal because it provides corroboration of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada. These factors weigh in favour of admission.\n[28] Although the flyer from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church describes an event that happened in the two weeks before the appeal was perfected (i.e. XXXX event on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020), I find the relevance of that event was only apparent after the DSS visited XXXX XXXX XXXX wife in XXXX 2021 stating they were aware of his activities in Canada. The text messages are from XXXX 2022 and could not have been provided at the time the appeal was perfected. I find the flyer from XXXX XXXX GTA (XXXX of Nigeria) could not have been provided when the appeal was perfected. The relevance of the public nature of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada only became apparent after the DSS visited XXXX XXXX XXXX wife in XXXX 2021 stating they were aware of his activities in Canada. Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX showed the flyer in response to a question at the oral hearing and was asked to provide a copy of the document to the RAD. These factors also weigh in favour of admission.\n[29] The requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA are met and the flyer from XXXX XXXX XXXX Church and text messages are new, relevant, and credible. They both describe new events that happened after the rejection of XXXX XXXX XXXX claim for protection. The flyer provides evidence that XXXX XXXX XXXX has been XXXX about issues in Nigeria and is critical of the President of Nigeria. This is relevant to the appeal, as it addresses the future risk XXXX XXXX XXXX may face in Nigeria. The text messages are relevant as they provide details about how XXXX XXXX XXXX obtained the flyer. I find both documents credible for the purposes of admission.\n[30] Similarly, the flyer from XXXX XXXX GTA (XXXX of Nigeria) meets the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA and the document is new, relevant, and credible. Although the flyer describes an event that happened before the RPD rejected XXXX XXXX XXXX claim, I find he could not have been expected to provide the document before the RPD rejected his claim as the relevance of the public nature of his work only became apparent after the appeal was perfected. The document was also provided at the request of the RAD. The document is relevant as it is related to the credibility of XXXX XXXX XXXX work in Canada as a XXXX. Nothing on the face of the document causes me to doubt its credibility and I saw the original document during the oral hearing.\n[31] I admit the further submissions provided on July 12, 2022. The submissions address why the new evidence should be admitted and provide submissions about why XXXX XXXX XXXX believes he is at risk in Nigeria. These submissions were provided after XXXX XXXX XXXX former counsel made a request to withdraw as counsel of record and XXXX XXXX XXXX began representing himself. Given the change of representation, I find it ensures fairness to give XXXX XXXX XXXX an opportunity to make written submissions about his appeal.\nANALYSIS\n[32] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.8\n[33] After conducting an independent assessment of the evidence, including the new evidence admitted on appeal and the testimony at the oral hearing, I find XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee. He faces a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Nigeria.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX is credible\n[34] I agree with the RPD that XXXX XXXX XXXX has established his identity and nationality through a copy of his Nigerian passport.\n[35] The RPD did not make any credibility findings, except its finding that XXXX XXXX XXXX is an XXXX XXXX. I have reviewed the entire record before me and find XXXX XXXX XXXX has established his allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\n[36] XXXX XXXX XXXX testimony at the RPD was detailed and forthcoming. He testified about the violence against his family, the threats and attacks against him, as well as his education and work as a Christian XXXX. His testimony was consistent with his Basis of Claim and amendments and supporting documents. I am satisfied with XXXX XXXX XXXX explanation for why he did not claim refugee protection while in the USA based on his understanding of the processes available to him. He initially had status as a student and then was not aware he could claim protection in the USA based on his situation. He claimed protection at an irregular border crossing to Canada shortly after learning of the ability to do so. XXXX XXXX XXXX also disclosed numerous supporting documents before the RPD, including documents confirming his XXXX education and training, his studies in the USA, and his work in churches and communities in Canada. The RPD did not note any concerns with any of XXXX XXXX XXXX supporting documents and I also have no concerns. I give the documents full weight.\n[37] I also find XXXX XXXX XXXX has established the events that occurred after the RPD rejected his claim for protection, on a balance of probabilities. Specifically, I find XXXX XXXX XXXX has continued his work as a XXXX in Canada and his XXXX includes criticisms of the government and president of Nigeria. I find the DSS visited his wife's residence in Lagos on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 to inquire about XXXX XXXX XXXX and the DSS were aware of his activities in Canada.\n[38] I make these findings after considering the RPD record, XXXX XXXX XXXX testimony at the oral hearing, and the new evidence. Supporting documents confirm XXXX XXXX XXXX has been XXXX in several churches in Toronto that serve a large Nigerian diaspora. He has XXXX as a visiting XXXX at a church in Calgary and led an XXXX XXXX to Nigerian-Christians in the Toronto area. He has been doing this work consistently since entering Canada and previously did similar work in the USA and Nigeria.\n[39] At the hearing, XXXX XXXX XXXX testified with detail about his continued XXXX in Canada, including XXXX at churches in different cities. He provided details of the contents of his XXXX, such as his criticisms about the Nigerian President. He answered questions about a talk he gave on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, titled \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - Nigerians in dispora [sic] must arise against XXXX a Fulani-herdsmen in disguise\". XXXX XXXX XXXX testimony at the oral hearing was consistent with the supporting documents, which I give full weight, as well as the new evidence about his work in Canada.\n[40] XXXX XXXX XXXX also testified about learning the DSS visited his wife's residence to ask about him. His testimony was detailed and was consistent with the Affidavit from his wife. He also provided details about how his wife obtained the disclosed Affidavit. I find the Affidavit is a genuine document as it conforms to country evidence about the issuance of affidavits by a court. The Affidavit is highly probative as his wife personally experienced the events she describes. I give it full weight towards establishing the DSS visited XXXX XXXX XXXX wife's residence on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 and told her they were aware of his activities in Canada.\n[41] I find the letter from the XXXX XXXX of Nigeria is a genuine letter from the organization, as I find credible XXXX XXXX XXXX testimony at the oral hearing about his membership in the organization and how he obtained the letter. However, I give the letter limited weight because of issues about its reliability and its low probative value. At the oral hearing, I asked XXXX XXXX XXXX how a letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 (typed at the top of the letter and hand-written near the signature) could reference the DSS visit in XXXX 2021. XXXX XXXX XXXX acknowledged the letter was dated in two places and this date did not make sense given the contents of the letter. He surmised there was a typographical error, but could not provide more of an explanation as he did not prepare the letter. XXXX XXXX XXXX explanation does not resolve the internal inconsistency. There is no typographical error in the date of the DSS visit as the letter correctly references XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021. There could be a typographical error in the typed date at the top of the letter, but then the same date is hand-written near the signature. I find this internal inconsistency reduces the reliability of the contents of the letter. I also note the letter's probative value is low as the author has no independent knowledge of XXXX XXXX XXXX activities in Canada or the DSS visit to XXXX XXXX XXXX wife's residence. The author did not directly witness any of these events.\n[42] Overall, after weighing the evidence in the RPD record, XXXX XXXX XXXX testimony at the oral hearing, and the new evidence, I conclude XXXX XXXX XXXX has established his allegations, including the events that occurred after the RPD rejected his claim, on a balance of probabilities.\nNexus to a Convention ground\n[43] XXXX XXXX XXXX faces persecution by reason of his political opinion. Through his XXXX in Canada, he has publicly criticized the Nigerian government response to violence against Christians, including violence by Fulani groups and Boko Haram. He has also vigorously condemned the president of Nigeria's perceived apathy to this violence and called for the Nigerian diaspora to rise against the president. I find his XXXX is expressing an \"opinion on any matter in which the machinery of state, government and policy may be engaged\".9 XXXX XXXX XXXX expression of his political opinion has recently led to interest in him by state authorities. This is evidenced by the DSS awareness of XXXX XXXX XXXX criticisms of the Nigerian government and president, as well as their warning they are monitoring his actions in Canada. Based on these events, I find the DSS view XXXX XXXX XXXX as a critic and agitator against the Nigerian government.\nFear of persecution is well-founded\n[44] The RPD found XXXX XXXX XXXX did not face a future serious possibility of persecution as a Christian XXXX. The RPD assessed the country evidence to determine whether Christian XXXX like XXXX XXXX XXXX face a serious possibility of persecution. It found that although there is violence directed at Christians, there was no evidence that Christian XXXX are persecuted.\n[45] I have accepted new evidence that arose after the RPD decision disclosing the DSS is aware of XXXX XXXX XXXX activities in Canada and looked for him at his wife's residence in XXXX 2021. XXXX XXXX XXXX has established these allegations, on a balance of probabilities. These events happened after the RPD decision. I cannot uphold the RPD's findings about prospective risk when they were made in the absence of this evidence. I have therefore assessed whether XXXX XXXX XXXX fear of persecution is well-founded, including whether he faces a future serious possibility of persecution, in light of the new evidence.\n[46] I find XXXX XXXX XXXX fear of persecution is well-founded.\n[47] I find he has established his subjective fear of persecution based on his credible testimony. His fear is consistent with country evidence about the DSS and its serious human rights violations committed against critics and agitators of the government. The DSS is responsible for counterintelligence, internal security, counterterrorism, and surveillance.10 Given the DSS's roles, I find it credible they became aware of XXXX XXXX XXXX public XXXX to a large Nigerian diaspora in Canada, on a balance of probabilities. Additionally, there are credible reports the DSS engages in arbitrary arrests and detention of persons who are critical of the government or advocate for rights of ethnic or religious groups.11 In 2021, private security officers beat activists at a church for wearing shirts with the slogan #BuhariMustGo (referencing President Buhari) and handed the activists to the DSS.12 The DSS has been implicated in violence against critics and activists. Based on the DSS interest in XXXX XXXX XXXX and their history of rights violations, I find there is a serious possibility XXXX XXXX XXXX would face persecution from the DSS if he were forced to return to Nigeria.\nNo access to adequate state protection or an IFA\n[48] There is no state protection or IFA because the state is the agent of persecution. XXXX XXXX XXXX faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX other submissions do not need to be addressed\n[49] In the Memorandum of Argument submitted at the time the appeal was perfected, XXXX XXXX XXXX former counsel argued the RPD misconstrued his evidence and failed to assess the issue of IFA. I find I do not need to address these submissions as XXXX XXXX XXXX activities in Canada that have come to the attention of the Nigerian government are determinative of the claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] I allow the appeal. I substitute my own decision that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nTess Acton\nTess Acton\nAugust 4, 2022\nDate\n1 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, Geneva, 28 July 1951, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 189, at p. 137; and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, New York, 31 January 1967, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 606, p. 267; accession of Canada to both on 4 June 1969.\n2 Practice notice: RPD and RAD processing for individuals applying under government of Canada public policies, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, https:\/\/irb.gc.ca\/en\/legal-policy\/procedures\/Pages\/rpd-rad-pn-processing-claimants.aspx\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The PA has been designated as the designated representative for the minor Appellants.\n[2] The Appellants' initial claim also included the PA's adult daughter O. The RPD determined that O was a forthright and credible witness who had established her claim for protection under Section 96 on the basis of her sexual orientation. In the same decision, the RPD found that a viable internal flight alternative (\"IFA\") existed for the PA, the Minor Appellants and the AA in either Chittagong or Khulna, Bangladesh, and refused their claims. It is from that determination that the Appellants, collectively, appeal.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. I find that the RPD did not err in its decision that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. I further find that the determinative factor regarding the application of both section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA is the availability of an IFA in Bangladesh. I therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugeed nor persons in need of protection.1\nOVERVIEW\n[4] The PA was born, raised and educated in Bangladesh. He completed and graduated from high school and in 2004, established a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with his brother. The two were successful in their corporate endeavour and, in 2013, the PA began to purchase real estate, two properties of which were purchased outright by the PA, one of which was purchased jointly with the PA's brother. The PA claims that as their prosperity grew, political operatives from both the BNP Jubo Dal Party and its opposition party, the Awami League Chatra (AL)2 approached the brothers to, initially, request -- and subsequently demand - donations. The PA and his brother complied with the demands of both political parties.\n[5] Beginning in 2014, the PA and AA became aware of difficulties that their teenage daughter, O, was having in school as a result of her emerging sense of her sexual orientation as a lesbian.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2015, the PA's brother acquired permanent residency status in the United States.3\n[7] The PA claimed, in his Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") narrative that, in July 2016, he was visited at his offices by a party of imams, who accused the PA and AA of condoning O's sexual orientation. Upon hearing from the PA that, although he and the AA were trying to change O's mind regarding her sexual orientation, O appeared to be firm in her views, the imams slapped the PA and said that he and the AA should be stoned, before leaving the PA's offices. The PA claimed that in 2018, a group of imams returned to his offices and threatened him, with a gun, that he should allow the imams to take O to a women's madrassa.\n[8] The PA also claimed that his cousin, H, threatened to report O's sexual orientation to the police and, in the spring or summer of 2018, came to the PA's offices with a group composed of \"Muslim extremist\" and \"a few\" BNP Jubo Dal members, threatening to take O to a women's madrassa. The PA claims he paid the group a large amount of cash and, shortly thereafter, in XXXX 2018, the Appellants all left Bangladesh, travelling to the residence of the PA's brother in Texas. Shortly thereafter, the Appellants crossed over into Canada.\n[9] Shortly before the hearing, the PA submitted an amendment to his BOC wherein he claimed that, since his coming to Canada: (a) the PA's cousin, H, had worked for the AL in the recent elections where the AL candidate had been elected, (b) H had appropriated the PA's house in Dhaka where his offices were located, (c) Imam J had denounced O, the PA and the AA, (d) a relative had informed the PA that in XXXX 2020, unidentified imams had inquired as to the whereabouts of the PA and his family, and (e) the PA's cousin, H, contacted the PA in XXXX 2020, requesting that the PA legally transfer his businesses and properties to H.\n[10] At the hearing, the PA testified that he fears: (i) his cousin H, (ii) political operatives from both the AL and the BNP Jubo Dal, who have extorted money from him in the past, and (iii) Islamic extremists led by Imam J.\n[11] The RPD found that O had established her sexual orientation, was a person without recourse to police protection, for whom no viable IFA existed in Bangladesh and that there was a serious possibility O would be persecuted were she to return to Bangladesh and therefore was a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the IRPA.\n[12] Regarding the PA, the AA and the Minor Appellants (collectively, \"the Appellants\"), the RPD found that a viable IFA existed for them in either Khulna or Chittagong because the Appellants have not established that the three principal agents of persecution had either the ability or the interest in finding the Appellants in either of those two cities and that compelling reasons did not apply in this matter. The RPD also found that the PA had it within his power to defuse the interest of H by simply divesting and transferring his properties to H.\n[13] On appeal, the Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its analysis:\n(a) specifically erring when it found that the RPD did not take into account the familial relationship between the PA and his cousin - the agent of harm, H and erred in not taking into account that H would likely be able to leverage familial relations to eventually find the Appellants in the proposed IFAs, hereby forcing the Appellants to keep their new location secret from all relatives and family members, contrary to recent decision by the Federal Court;\n(b) the RPD erred in finding that the ownership of property is not a right (and thus the PA can vitiate H's pursuit by simply legally transferring his properties and businesses to H as, although that principle has been established with respect to Section 96, it has not been as clearly established with respect to Section 97;\n(c) The RPD erred in finding it reasonable that the Appellants could live separately from O;\n(d) The RPD erred in not taking into account that word of O's sexual orientation would follow the Appellants to any new location, compelling the PA to pay \"hush money\" and, in any event, objective evidence found in the National Documentation Package (NDP) corroborates the targeting of families of LGBT persons in Bangladesh; and\n(e) The RPD erred in not taking into account the likely lack of acceptable mental healthcare available to them in Bangladesh.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE\n[14] The determinative issue in this appeal is the availability of an IFA in Bangladesh for the Appellants.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\n[15] The Appellants have disclosed no new evidence, pursuant to subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, and have not requested an oral hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division (\"RAD\").4\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[16] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in assessing and weighing oral testimony. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.5\nANALYSIS\nA viable IFA is present for the Appellants in Bangladesh\n[17] The Federal Court, in Rasaratnam, established a two-prong test for assessing the viability of an IFA: (a) the RAD must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted and that the claimant would not be subject to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment; and (b) it must not be unreasonable for the claimant to settle in the proposed place of refuge.6 Both prongs must be satisfied. Once the issue of a potential IFA has been raised and the potential IFA identified, the burden shifts to the Appellants to show that they do not have a viable IFA.\nThe first prong of the IFA test\n[18] I find that there is not a serious possibility that the Appellants would be pursued by the alleged agents of persecution were they to relocate to either Khulna or Chittagong.\nPursuit by Cousin H, his colleagues in BNP and AL, and Islamic extremists\n[19] The PA was asked at the hearing how the agents of persecution would find the Appellants were they to avoid Dhaka and go directly to one of the proposed IFAs. The PA alleged and testified that the Islamic extremists and Imam J, as well as the political extortionists of the BNP and AL would all be able to find the Appellants in the proposed IFA through the PA's Cousin H, who would: (a) be able to deploy his insider status as a family member to find out if the Appellants had returned to Bangladesh and determine where they were living, and (b) would promptly share this information with both the Islamic extremists and his colleagues in the BNP and AL.\n[20] I find, on the balance of probabilities, that the Appellants do not have a forward-facing fear of pursuit as - even though the Islamic extremists, the BNP and AL operatives may retain motivation to find and punish the Appellants, they lack the means to locate them, absent the cooperation of the PA's Cousin H. I further find that Cousin H lacks the motivation to pursue the Appellants to the proposed IFAs. The Appellants allege that Cousin H seeks the PA to pressure him to relinquish his land and that Cousin H would be sure to alert both the Islamic fundamentalists and Cousin H's own contacts in BNP and AL were the Appellants to return to Bangladesh. The RPD found that -- as the PA has testified that H has already seized most of the PA's properties and businesses -- H would be unlikely to waste his time pursuing the PA, even were he to learn of their return to Bangladesh. The RPD however also found that any potential pursuit by H could be pre-emptively defused by the PA transferring the remainder of his as-yet un-seized lands to H. The RPD found that the PA does not have a fundamental right to land ownership and that abandoning or transferring land \"to eliminate the risk of persecution would not violate their basic human rights.\"7 The RPD found that the Appellants have not established that Cousin H would maintain interest in the Appellants or their whereabouts, were H to acquire the PA's remaining lands. On appeal, the Appellants argue that the RPD erred in: (a) not taking into account the fact that Cousin H, as a family member, would be able to find out where the Appellants were living and (b) finding that the ownership of property is not a right as, although that principle has been established with respect to Section 96, it has not been as clearly established with respect to Section 97.\n[21] I have reviewed the record before me, including Kenguruka v. Canada, (where the Federal Court found that the threats of violence stemming from an inheritance claim did not constitute grounds for refugee protection), cited by the Appellants for the proposition that the Federal Court has not yet ruled on the question of property ownership under Section 97. I find that it is not unreasonable for the PA to abandon his remaining property not yet possessed by Cousin H in order to eliminate the future risk posed by him. I agree with the RPD that property ownership is not a fundamental right of the same weight as, for example, religion, and that the PA has no basic right to retain his property if this ownership is the proximate cause of his fear. The Federal Court in Malik found that forgoing a lawsuit was not equivalent to comprising an identity or a fundamental belief.8 Here, the Appellants have alleged and argued that the entire basis of the dispute with Cousin H is his desire to seize and appropriate the properties and business of the PA. The PA therefore has it within his power to eliminate his fear of Cousin H by ceding it directly to him, thereby doing away with Cousin H's interest in the Appellants. I should note that this approach is in accord with similar RAD decisions based on Section 97 claims.9 Were he to rid himself of the land there would no longer be any risk to him under Section 97 as Cousin H would no longer have any interest in him. I therefore find that the Appellants have not established that Cousin H would have the motivation to pursue them to the IFAs. Absent motivation on the part of Cousin H, the other agents of persecution lack the means to locate the Appellants. I therefore find that, collectively, the agents of persecution lack either the means or the motivation to find the Appellants in the IFAs.\n[22] The Appellants have also raised the argument that even were Cousin H to obtain the Appellant's land, he could use his position as a family member to find out where the Appellants were living and extort bribes by way of \"hush money\" from them in order to keep the secret of O's sexual orientation hidden. I find that this is speculative as the only motivation of Cousin H raised in the PA's BOC or at the hearing was Cousin H's desire to obtain legal title to the PA's land and businesses. The Appellants did not allege or disclose any evidence that Cousin H had ever contemplated extorting hush money from the Appellants, nor did the PA testify that Cousin H had ever raised the question of hush money. I find that the Appellants have not established that Cousin H has the intention, let alone the motivation, to extort hush money from the Appellants once he has possession and title to the PA's lands. I therefore find that the Appellants have not established that the IFAs fail on the first prong of the test.\nThe second prong of the test\n[23] Every relocation entails hardship. The threshold is whether a given claimant will undergo great physical danger or undue hardship in travelling or staying in the proposed IFA.10 The Federal Court of Appeal, in Ranganathan, found that hardship associated with dislocation and relocation is not in itself sufficient to render an IFA unreasonable. The court in that decision set out:\n\"[A] very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized.\"11\nThe burden is on the Appellants to show that Khulna and Chittagong are unreasonable under this test.\nThe psychological state of the PA, AA, and Minor Appellants\n[24] I find that the Appellants have failed to show how the proposed IFAs are unreasonable and therefore the proposed IFAs pass the second prong of the test. The RPD found that, having assessed the medical report concerning the mental health of the PA and AA, and having assessed the objective evidence in the NDP regarding the metal health facilities available in Bangladesh, the PA and AA's mental health would not render the proposed IFAs unreasonable, on a balance of probabilities. The Appellants argue that the proposed IFAs are not reasonable because it is not reasonable for the Appellants to be forced to live apart from their sibling\/adult daughter, O, and, that the RPD failed to properly analyze the medical reports regarding the psychological impact of their daughter\/sibling's sexual orientation on the Appellants which would be exacerbated were they to return to Bangladesh, no matter how otherwise acceptable the health-care system might be.\n[25] I have reviewed the record before me. O is an adult, having turned 19 in XXXX 2021. Being separated from adult family members is a hardship without question, but I find that it does not fall within the category of unreasonable hardship envisioned by the Federal Court of Appeal in Ranganathan. Moreover, the Appellants travel frequently, both to the United States of America to visit the PA's brother and business partner, and to other parts of the world. There is nothing to prevent O and the Appellants from meeting, either in Texas, the home state of the PA's brother or elsewhere where O's sexual orientation would not prove to be an obstacle. Regarding the question of the PA and AA's anxieties and overall mental health, I find that, having consulted the NDP for Bangladesh, they will be able to obtain treatment in the proposed IFAs as mental healthcare is offered by \"both government and private facilities, the vast majority being concentrated in urban areas, especially in metropolitan cities.\"12 Moreover, I also find that increased anxiety of the variety depicted in the medical reports, similarly does not rise to the level of unreasonableness envisioned by the Federal Court of Appeal in Ranganathan as the \"moderate\" level of anxiety experienced by the AA does not rise to the level of \"existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\"\n[26] For all these reasons, I find that the second prong of the test has not been met and that the Appellants have failed to show how the proposed IFAs of Chittagong and Khulna are unreasonable.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAndrea Poole\nAndrea Poole\nJanuary 14, 2022\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, (IRPA) S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, at para. 111(1)(a).\n2 The two parties alternate in forming government and opposition according to the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP), for Bangladesh, (16 April 2021), Item 4.5, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Response to Information Request, May 22, 2019.

In her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), the appellant alleges that she was a victim of violence perpetrated by her husband and son. She came to Canada with a visa on XXXX XXXX, 2020, and claimed refugee protection on December 11, 2020. She fears for her safety should she return to Lebanon.\n2. In its decision, the RPD found that the appellant was not a credible witness due to inconsistencies in her testimony and her returns to Kuwait and Lebanon. The RPD considered that although the appellant's marital and family problems were unfortunate, they did not reach the required threshold to amount to persecution and that, as a result, the appellant had failed to demonstrate there would be a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to her life if she returns to Lebanon.\n3. In her memorandum, the appellant argues that the representation provided by her former counsel, whom she believed to be a lawyer, was inadequate in that he failed to inform her that she could have her daughter testify. She argues that her daughter could have corroborated her testimony regarding the domestic violence and that this would have had a major impact on the outcome of her claim.\n4. The appellant advised her former counsel of her allegations of inadequate representation in accordance with Practice Notice - Allegations Against Former Counsel,1 and he submitted his responses on the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) record.\n5. The determinative issues for the RAD are procedural fairness and credibility.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The appeal is dismissed. Former counsel's actions did not deprive the appellant of her right to procedural fairness. The RPD correctly determined that the appellant was not a credible witness and that she is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[3] In her memorandum, the appellant does not indicate that she has new evidence; however, she included two affidavits, one signed by her and the other by her daughter. These affidavits describe new developments and are therefore subject to the provisions of subsection 110(4) regarding their admissibility as new evidence.\n[4] Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act2 (IRPA), I can allow only evidence\ni) that arose after the RPD rendered its decision;\nii) that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii) that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented to the RPD before the decision was rendered.\niv) If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide whether the evidence is new, credible and relevant before admitting it.3\n[5] Both affidavits are admitted as new evidence.\n[6] In their respective affidavits, the appellant and her daughter state that at their last meeting with a lawyer to prepare the appellant's appeal, they learned that the former counsel was not a lawyer, that the appellant's daughter, who had witnessed her father's violent acts toward her mother, could have testified before the RPD and that this could have changed the outcome of the refugee protection claim. This information meets the first three criteria of subsection 110(4) since, according to the memorandum, it was only while preparing the appeal with the appellant's lawyer that they discovered this information. It consequently arose after the RPD's decision.\n[7] The documents are credible because they are affidavits containing statements made under oath by the appellant and her daughter, new because they bring new evidence concerning the allegations of persecution and relevant because they could have an impact on the outcome of the claim.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The role of the RAD is to review RPD decisions by applying the correctness standard of review.4 Having applied this standard of review and conducted my own analysis of the record, which included listening to the recording of the hearing held before the RPD on April 15, 2021, and ensuring that Chairperson's Guideline 45 was implemented, I consider that the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice were not breached and that the RPD did not err in finding that the appellant was not a credible witness. The reasons are as follows.\n[9] In its decision, the RPD concluded that due to contradictions, inconsistencies and behaviour inconsistent with a subjective fear directly related to her allegations of violence, the appellant was not a credible witness and that, consequently, she had failed to establish that she faced a serious possibility of persecution if she returned to Lebanon or, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be subjected personally to a risk to her life or to other treatment provided under section 97 of the IRPA.\nProfessional qualifications of the former counsel were known to the appellant and her daughter\n[10] In her memorandum, the appellant argues that she did not know that her former counsel was not a lawyer and that had she known this, she would not have retained his services. She included an affidavit from herself and another from her daughter that both contain statements to the effect that the former counsel never disclosed to them that he was not a lawyer.\n[11] When claimants swear to the truth of certain allegations, they are presumed to be telling the truth. However, this presumption is rebuttable where the evidence is inconsistent with the testimony or where the RPD is unsatisfied with the explanation provided for those inconsistencies.6\n[12] With respect, the appellant and her daughter are not credible when they assert in their respective affidavits that they did not know that the appellant's former counsel was not a lawyer. I reviewed the contents of the RPD record and the former counsel's response to the allegations of inadequate representation.7 These documents, of which I have reproduced the relevant excerpts, demonstrate that the former counsel disclosed clearly to the appellant and her daughter that he was an immigration consultant and member of the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (ICCRC). I note that according to the response from the former counsel, the appellant's daughter, who, based on her statement at paragraph 12 of the BOC Form, is proficient in English, went with her mother to all meetings with the former counsel.\n[13] Basis of Claim Form - Question 9(k), Refugee Protection Division record: The appellant checked the box indicating that she was represented by an immigration consultant (emphasis added). She states further on under question 11, Declaration B, that the BOC Form was interpreted to her in Arabic and that the information it contained was complete, true and correct. I note that at the RPD hearing, she stated that the information in her BOC Form was complete, true and correct.8 At paragraph 12 of this same document, under the heading \"Interpreter's Declaration,\" the appellant's daughter, XXXX XXXX, signed to declare that she had interpreted the BOC Form from Arabic to English for the appellant and provided any explanations to her and that the appellant had assured her that she understood the entire content of the document and all answers.\n[14] Use of a Representative, Form IMM 5476, Section B, question 6, Refugee Protection Division record, page 94: The appellant indicated that she was represented by a consultant who was a member of the ICCRC, membership number R421983, under question 10 in the document, and the appellant signed the declaration on XXXX XXXX, 2020, indicating that \"I have fully and truthfully answered all questions on this form.... I also declare that I have read and understood all the statements on this form, having asked and obtained an explanation for every point that was not clear to me.\"\n[15] Retainer agreement with the former counsel signed by the appellant (\"Retainer Agreement,\" Document 1 - RAD record): In his response to the allegations of inadequate representation, the former counsel indicates that the appellant signed, in the presence of her daughter, the \"Retainer Agreement\" - Refugee, which clearly stipulates that he is a member, under membership number R421983, of \"Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants - RCIC,\" a member organization of the ICCRC.\n[16] In light of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the presumption of truthfulness afforded to the appellant and her daughter is rebutted, because the documentary evidence contradicts their assertions in their affidavits to the effect that they did not know that the former counsel was not a lawyer. I consider that the information was disclosed to them by the former counsel and, consequently, that they knew that he was not a lawyer. In these circumstances, I consider that the affidavits are of little probative value and I give them only limited weight.\nAdequate representation by the former counsel\n[17] In her memorandum, the appellant argues that her former counsel did not represent her adequately in that he failed to inform her that she could have her daughter testify. She alleges that her daughter witnessed many of her husband's violent acts toward her and that her testimony would have had a major impact on the outcome of her claim.\n[18] In his response to the allegations of inadequate representation, the former counsel explains that he hesitated to have the appellant's daughter testify for the following reasons: she has lived in Canada for more than 12 years and was therefore [translation] \"distanced from the recent problems the mother had been having with her husband and the recently married son who was still living with her along with his wife.\"9 He adds that \"had the appellant known that her daughter could be with her during the hearing, she would have stopped making an effort to prepare on her own.\"\n[19] With respect, I disagree with the appellant when she argues that the former counsel did not adequately represent her.\n[20] In Rendon Segovia et al,10 the Federal Court established a tripartite test in which each of the following elements must be met to demonstrate that the incompetence of counsel amounted to a breach of procedural fairness:\n- a. Prior counsel's acts or omissions constituted incompetence or misconduct;\n- b. A miscarriage of justice resulted in the sense that, but for the alleged conduct, the result would have been different; and\n- c. Prior counsel was given an opportunity to respond.\n[21] The first two criteria must be analyzed in conjunction with one another since they are closely linked. To meet the allegation of incompetence, the appellant must prove that her counsel was incompetent in choosing not to have her daughter testify or negligent in failing to advise her of the option to have her daughter testify, that this failure resulted in an error and that had it not been for this failure, it is reasonably likely that the result of the claim would have been different. This requires a very high level of proof before the panel can accept the argument, which the appellant has failed to bring in this case.11\n[22] The Federal Court of Appeal has noted that it is settled that an applicant must live with the consequences of the actions of his counsel.12 As counsel, it was up to him to decide whether to call witnesses at the hearing on the appellant's behalf. In the case at hand, the decision not to have the appellant's daughter-who had left Lebanon more than 12 years previous, a fact not known to the RPD-testify does not appear unreasonable in light of the circumstances and the limited relevance of such testimony in relation to the analysis of fear of future persecution.\n[23] Concerning the appellant's allegation in her affidavit that her former counsel failed to inform her that she could have her daughter testify, the evidence in this regard is somewhat ambiguous. In his response, the former counsel indicates that [translate] \"had the appellant known that her daughter could be with her during the hearing (emphasis added), she would have stopped making an effort to prepare on her own.\" Now, being present during a hearing is not the same as giving specific testimony regarding a particular point.\n[24] I also listened carefully to the recording of the hearing before the RPD on April 15, 2021. In response to the question put to her by the RPD regarding her daughter's absence, the appellant testified that her daughter had witnessed acts and that [translation] \"I could ask her to testify.\" When the RPD asked her why she had not done so, the appellant replied, [translation] \"I don't know.\" The RPD rejected the appellant's explanations as not credible13 since this went to the heart of her allegations of violence and she was represented by counsel.\n[25] Lastly, I note that this allegation is made in the same affidavit that I have decided not to give any weight to in view of the appellant's credibility issues in relation to another assertion made in the same document. Where the claimant's personal testimony is not credible, it is reasonable to have credibility concerns about the supporting documentary evidence and to accord it minimal weight.14\n[26] In these circumstances, I am of the opinion that former counsel adequately represented the appellant and that principles of fairness were not violated.\nOutcome would have been the same\n[27] In her memorandum, the appellant argues that had she been able to have her daughter testify, the outcome of her claim would have been different. She does not contest the RPD's other findings regarding her credibility issues, specifically her behaviour inconsistent with that of a person in danger when she returned to live with her husband in Kuwait after leaving him, her return to Lebanon, her vague and superficial testimony, and her avoiding answering questions concerning her allegations of violence.\n[28] With respect, I cannot accept the argument that the RPD's decision was based on the absence of her daughter's testimony and that had it not been for this absence, the result would have been different. It is true that the RPD noted the absence of a witness whom it considered important, namely the appellant's daughter, but the RPD did not know that she had left Lebanon more than 12 years prior to the hearing.\n[29] Moreover, a review of the RPD reasons and decision and the recording of the hearing reveals that the RPD's decision did not ultimately revolve around the daughter's testimony. It revolved around the testimony of the appellant or refugee protection claimant, who was unable to establish on a balance of probabilities that there would be a serious possibility of persecution should she return to Lebanon or a risk to her life or other treatment under section 97, on a balance of probabilities, as set out below, hence the RPD's finding, which I consider correct, that the appellant was not credible.\nVague and superficial testimony\n[30] The RPD noted immediately that the appellant was not always directly answering the questions put to her, particularly in relation to the allegations of violence, which were nonetheless central to her claim. In response to repeated questions from the RPD, the appellant was unable to provide details as to the persecution she alleges she experienced, remaining superficial: she replied that her husband would go out early in the morning and return in the evening, leaving her crying alone at home, that he was not clean, that he was stingy and would take her money, and that she did not love him. When asked again whether her husband had been violent toward her, she replied vaguely and evaded the question while indicating that he was not interested in her and that he had committed adultery. In light of the testimony, the RPD's decision that the appellant's evidence regarding the allegation of violence was essentially limited to marital problems is correct.\n[31] That said, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated that refugee law ought to concern itself with actions which deny human dignity and that the sustained or systemic denial of core human rights is the appropriate standard.15\nLack of subjective fear\n[32] The appellant testified that she had left her husband while they were living in Kuwait in 1991 to go live in Lebanon for three years. In 1994, she returned to Kuwait with her three children to live with her husband because she needed someone to provide for her financially, an explanation considered unsatisfactory by the RPD since she had been able to live for three years in Lebanon while providing for herself and her children. The RPD considered that the appellant's returning to her husband was behaviour inconsistent with that of a person who fears for their life.\n[33] In 2013, the appellant returned again to live in Lebanon with her children. After initially avoiding answering a question from the RPD as to whether her husband joined her in Lebanon, she went on to testify that she had agreed to have her husband come live with them because he had health problems. When then asked about the fears of violence if she returned to Lebanon, she testified that her husband would take her money and that he was not clean.\n[34] It is well established that remaining longer than necessary in a country where one fears persecution or voluntarily returning to that country is behaviour that can demonstrate a lack of subjective fear or is inconsistent with that of a person who genuinely fears for their life.16 In my view, the RPD's decision that the appellant demonstrated a lack of subjective fear by returning to live with her husband on two occasions and returning to Lebanon is correct.\nContradiction in the evidence\n[35] When asked again about any violent acts, the appellant testified that her husband had cuffed her on the ear. However, this statement contradicts the statement in her BOC Form that it was her son who had cuffed her on the ear. Faced with this contradiction, she testified that it was her husband, not her son, who had struck her on the ear but that the son had put money in her mouth on one occasion during an argument about money. When questioned a second time concerning the contradiction, the appellant testified that it was her son who had struck her before going back on her testimony and stating that it was instead her husband.17\n[36] The RPD's decision that this contradiction undermined the appellant's credibility is correct.\n[37] In the present case, after reading the RPD's decision, listening to the recording of the hearing and considering the arguments presented on appeal, I am of the opinion that the correct decision was to reject the refugee protection claim, as the inconsistencies and contradictions and the lack of subjective fear are fatal to the appellant's credibility.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] I conclude that the former counsel's actions did not deprive the appellant of her right to procedural fairness. The appellant had ample opportunity to argue her refugee protection claim.\n[39] I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely that XXXX XXXX is neither a refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA.\n[40] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nNicole Ladouceur\nNicole Ladouceur\nFebruary 7, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Practice Notice - Allegations Against Former Counsel, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), effective date August 13, 2018.\n2 Subs. 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They are appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated May 25, 2021, rejecting their refugee protection claims under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The co-appellant and the minor appellants are basing their claims on that of the principal appellant.\n[3] The RPD found the appellant not to be credible with regard to the basis of his refugee protection claim in light of major omissions in his evidence and certain hesitations in his testimony. The appellant is disputing the RPD's credibility analysis and is asking the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow the appeal or refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination.\nOVERVIEW\n[4] The appellants lived in the city of XXXX, in the state of Tlaxcala. In the Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), the appellant states that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, he was intercepted on the road by individuals who beat him and stole the car that he was using for work. His assailants also demanded that he pay XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos within 24 hours or they would take action against his family. The appellants left their home to hide at the home of an aunt in Mexico City.\n[5] The appellant left Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2018, to claim refugee protection in Canada. The co-appellant and the minor appellants left Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2019, to join the appellant in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] After conducting an independent analysis of all of the evidence on the record, including the recording of the hearing, for the reasons below, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellants failed to demonstrate that they are refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[7] The appeal is dismissed.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[8] The RAD is required to conduct its own analysis to determine whether the RPD acted correctly with respect to each error identified in the appellant's arguments. While, in certain exceptional cases, the RAD may show deference to the RPD's assessment,1 the applicable standard of review in this case is correctness.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[9] I find that the issues the RPD raised in the appellant's testimony are not serious enough to undermine his overall credibility given all of the evidence on the record. However, I consider that the determinative issue is the appellants' internal flight alternative (IFA) in Mexico. As a result, I will deal with the credibility issues only where they impact the IFA analysis.\nInternal flight alternative\n[10] The applicable test for an IFA is two-pronged. The onus is on appellants to establish: 1) that they would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the locations proposed as IFAs; and that 2) in light of all the circumstances, it would be objectively unreasonable or too harsh to seek refuge there.2\n[11] Because the IFA is a new issue on appeal, the RAD gave the appellants and (the Minister) the opportunity to make submissions regarding the possibility of moving to M\u00e9rida or Mexico City, which they did on January 17, 2022. The Minister did not make submissions in this regard. The RAD also disclosed to the parties the National Documentation Package on Mexico dated September 29, 2021 (NDP), that the RAD relied on in its decision.\nFirst prong - Prospective risk not established\n[12] I am of the opinion that the appellants failed to establish that they would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution or to one of the risks set out in section 97 of the IRPA if they moved to M\u00e9rida or Mexico City.\n[13] The IFA analysis requires a contextual approach, taking into account the profile of the agents of harm and their motivation and ability to track them down throughout Mexico. A serious possibility of the appellants' being persecuted can only be found if it is demonstrated that the agents of harm have the \"means and motivation\" to search for the appellants.3\n[14] The appellants state that the agents of harm are motivated to find them throughout Mexico, which includes M\u00e9rida and Mexico City. This is due to the fact that the appellant defied his assailants by not giving them the money they were demanding and by reporting his kidnapping to the office of the attorney general of the state of Tlaxcala. The appellant refers to Tab 7.8 of the NDP to state that vengeance and cooperation with the authorities are reasons that could motivate a criminal group in Mexico to track certain individuals. It is argued that, today, the agents of harm are still motivated to find him and eliminate him, in particular, as a show of power and control in Mexico.\n[15] I considered the appellants' arguments cited above. However, I am of the opinion that neither the appellant's testimony nor the documentary evidence demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm have an ongoing interest in the appellants.\n[16] First, I am of the opinion that it has not been established on a balance of credible evidence that the agents of harm were actually members of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG).\n[17] As the RPD correctly noted, the appellant does not mention the CJNG in his written account. Moreover, there is no mention of it in his complaint to the attorney general either. The letter from the aunt who hid the appellant in her home also does not mention it. I consider these omissions major because it is the most powerful cartel in Mexico, a factor that significantly amplifies the appellants' prospective risk, and the appellant should have mentioned it at the first opportunity.\n[18] With respect to the omission of the cartel in his report, counsel states that police in Mexico are corrupt, and want to avoid inciting the hatred of the most powerful cartel by not making accusations against them. The appellant testified initially that he does not know whether he mentions the cartel by name in his complaint. He then stated that it was actually the police who omitted this information from its report.\n[19] I find this explanation not credible because, as mentioned above, this information was also omitted from his BOC Form. If the police actually intentionally omitted any mention of the CJNG from its report, it is reasonable to expect this explanation to be provided in the appellant's written account, or at least for the cartel to be clearly identified therein and not identified in vague terms only, such as [translation] \"criminals or \"delinquents.\"\n[20] I also cannot retain the argument that it was a misinterpretation in the communication between the appellant and initial counsel. It is difficult to explain the total omission of the name of a cartel throughout the written account by a misinterpretation. Therefore, I consider that the appellant failed to establish on a balance of credible evidence that the agent of harm is truly the CJNG.\n[21] I also note that, following the alleged incidents, the co-appellant and the minor appellants continued living in Mexico City for one year without any harm, aside from the two calls she alleges she received on XXXX XXXX and XXXX, 2018. The co-appellant states that the agents of harm obtained access to her number because they had stolen her husband's telephone, and that these individuals told her that they knew her address. The appellant adds that his parents' address was also in his stolen telephone.\n[22] I consider that if the criminals in question had truly intended to seek revenge against the appellant and his family as a show of power and because the appellant did not pay the money that was demanded, they could have easily done so given that they knew the co-appellant's address and that of the appellants' parents. However, there is no evidence that the agents of harm made any efforts in that regard. According to the co-appellant's testimony, the calls stopped once she changed her telephone number. This demonstrates the cartel's lack of interest in the appellants.\n[23] Finally, I note that although the appellant went to the authorities to file a complaint, the assailants are not identified in that document and there is no evidence of any follow-up to the complaint.\n[24] Although the appellant still fears his assailants, this is insufficient to establish that the latter have the motivation to search for him across the country. I consider that the appellant was simply the victim of a crime of opportunity. The appellant is not a particular enemy of criminals who would be the subject of ongoing interest after his departure from the region.4 In the absence of evidence in this regard, I conclude that this is merely an unfounded hypothesis.\n[25] Having concluded that their agents of harm have no interest in pursuing the appellants in the cities proposed as IFAs, it is not necessary for the panel to address the issue of whether these individuals have the ability to do so.\nSecond prong - Relocating to the cities proposed as IFAs is not unreasonable\n[26] According to the Federal Court of Appeal in Ranganathan, the threshold is very high when determining whether it is unreasonable for a refugee protection claimant to relocate elsewhere in the country to flee the alleged danger. The Court stated:\nIt requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions....This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.5 [emphasis added].\n[27] The appellant notes that he was the only person who supported his family and that he would have difficulty finding another job in his field because his former employer had accused him of stealing the company car during the incident on XXXX XXXX, 2018. Furthermore, it is stated that their work experience in Canada in the field of XXXX XXXX would not be useful in Mexico because there are very few businesses in that field there. In addition, the appellant argues that it is more difficult for people over 30 to find work in Mexico, especially in light of the pandemic.\n[28] I noted the fact that the pandemic has negatively affected Mexico's economy and that it could increase the poverty rate from 50 percent to 56 percent across the country.6 However, it is reported that the rural population is more vulnerable to poverty. Furthermore, the objective evidence on Mexico indicates that M\u00e9rida's employment rate was 97.5 percent for the first quarter of 2020 and that Mexico City's employment rate was 94.4 percent, some of the highest rates in the country.7 In addition, the government of the state of Yucatan has implemented a series of formal action programs for employment, describing itself as the state with the largest number of initiatives touted to combat the effects of the pandemic.\n[29] The appellant has some high school education and work experience in Mexico and Canada. Although he has not pursued higher studies, a large number of jobs in Mexico are general in nature. The co-appellant has pursued studies at the college level, as well as three years of studies at the post-college level, having obtained a XXXX diploma. According to her BOC Form, she was self-employed as a XXXX for over ten years.8 The appellants have demonstrated that they have the skills to adapt to a new situation, even in a foreign country. Although the appellant's relationship with his former employer soured due to the theft of the car, the appellant himself reported the theft to the police and therefore has evidence that he is not guilty of what he is accused of.\n[30] Although relocating is inherently difficult, I consider that neither the appellants' profiles nor the objective evidence establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be unable to start over and support themselves in the cities with some of the best economies in the country.\n[31] I conclude that the appellants have a viable IFA in M\u00e9rida and in Mexico City.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, I confirm, for other reasons, the RPD's determination that the appellants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, have failed to establish that they are refugees or persons in need of protection under sections 96 or 97 of the IRPA.\n[33] The appeal is dismissed.\n(Signed)\nBianca E Suciu\nBianca Eleonora Suciu\nFebruary 15, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Rozas del Solar v.

During the hearing, the RPD rejected two objections from the appellant's counsel.\n[3] The appellant states that the RPD exhibited bias, that its reasons are insufficiently reasoned and that the analysis of his credibility is incorrect.\n[4] The determinative issues for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) are procedural fairness, bias and credibility.\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD correctly determined that the appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The appellant filed the RPD member's curriculum vitae found online. He states that this new evidence supports his objection and demonstrates the decision-maker's religion, and states that he could not have expected to have to demonstrate the ethnic\/religious origins of the member to demonstrate an appearance of bias. He adds that he asked the member to recuse himself from the hearing because he accused the appellant of cheating by reading a text and because the member is allegedly a practising Muslim, [translation] \"even a fundamentalist\".1\nThe new evidence submitted by the appellant is rejected\n[7] The RAD may admit new evidence (i) that arose after the rejection of the claim or (ii) that was not reasonably available before the RPD rendered its decision, or (iii) if it was, that the appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.2 New evidence that meets at least one of these requirements must meet the three case law criteria of relevance, credibility and newness.3\n[8] The RPD member's curriculum vitae meets the third criterion of subsection 110(4): the appellant could not have known that he would be challenging the member's bias on the basis of his religion. This evidence does not meet the case law criterion of relevance. The case law of the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal is clear.4 The religion of a Board member or their inherent characteristics are not relevant to the analysis of bias:\nThe Board, like a corporation, acts through its members. They are flesh and blood. Mr. XXXX may be a man of religion, an agnostic or an atheist. He may be Sunni Muslim, Shia Muslim, Jewish, Roman Catholic, Orthodox Christian, Protestant, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist or an adherent of any other number of religions. The Court does not know. It is irrelevant.5 [Emphasis added]\n[9] As in Chaudhry, the appellant is basing himself on the same religious biases he is hoping to flee. However, is not entitled to \"choose\" the religion, if any, of the member who decides his case.\n[10] As my colleague Edward C. Robinson writes in a case from 2011:\nIt is desirable and, arguably, necessary that the composition of the tribunal reflect the composition of Canadian society and, in particular, the immigrant community which it has been created to serve. As a result, it is highly likely that members will hear the claims of applicants who are from the same country of origin or the same ethnicity as themselves and it is likely that the members will draw upon their knowledge and experience of the country to enhance their understanding of the applicant's claim. This will not result in a breach of natural or fundamental justice provided the member applies this knowledge or experience to the evidence before it.6 [Emphasis added]\nThe request for an oral hearing is denied\n[11] The appellant is requesting that I hold an oral hearing. I cannot hold an oral hearing because he did not submit any new admissible evidence.7\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[12] My role is to review all the evidence, which includes listening to the hearing and determining whether the RPD's decision is correct.8\n[13] The appellant claims that the rule by which he is responsible for specifying the RPD's errors that constitute the grounds for appeal and identifying where said errors are located9 is ultra vires. He explains that these rules limit the RAD's discretionary power, contrary to the law, that they are used only in the context of subsection 111(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) under which the RAD must assess whether the RPD decision is wrong in fact or in law. He is of the opinion that the RAD may easily hold an oral hearing if he provides a new piece of evidence, that it must not limit itself to conducting a judicial review of the RPD decision, and that it cannot rule on an issue of credibility without an oral hearing.\n[14] I do not accept these arguments. The Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada has the power to adopt rules in accordance with section 161 (a.2, c, d) of the IRPA,10 and in any case, the appellant identified and located the RPD's errors, in paragraphs 74 to 147 of his memorandum.\n[15] In Huruglica,11 the Federal Court of Appeal clearly addresses the RAD's role, in particular at paragraph 103. The Federal Court also pointed out12 that when an appellant fails to raise an issue on appeal before the RAD and the RAD confirms the RPD's decision, that issue should not be before it. In other decisions, the Court ruled that the RAD is not required to address unchallenged findings, but that it may set aside a decision if the RAD did not see a significant error in conducting an independent analysis of the file.13\n[16] The RAD has some flexibility. When it reviews an appeal file, it conducts its own analysis of the file in order to decide whether the RPD committed the error alleged by the appellant. It also has the power to raise new questions or overturn the RPD's conclusions, even if they are not challenged.\n[17] Since the appellant identified the errors committed by the RPD and is challenging its credibility findings, I carried out an independent analysis of the evidence.\nANALYSIS\nThe RPD did not exhibit bias or breach procedural fairness\n[18] The appellant alleges two distinct reasons in support of his allegations of a reasonable apprehension of bias:\na) The RPD twice asked to verify that the appellant was not using notes or documents during his testimony;\nb) The RPD member is Muslim, even a fundamentalist:\n[Translation]\nA devout practising Muslim who presides over a hearing for a Muslim convert gives an apprehension of bias for the decision that will be rendered since his religious beliefs may influence his decision. A decision for a decision-maker to render on a religious case should be rendered by someone of another religion or an atheist to avoid any influence of personal beliefs.14\n[19] The intrinsic characteristics of a Board member are not relevant to the analysis of a reasonable apprehension of bias. The question is rather to determine would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude that the RPD, consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.15\n[20] The appellant states that the RPD was vindictive against his counsel, which justified the refusal of his request for a recusal.\n[21] The RPD twice asked the appellant16 and his counsel to show that the appellant was not consulting his notes. If the RPD had doubts, it was normal for it to ask to see what is in front of the appellant and to check that the latter does not have notes. This intervention was courteous. It was rather the appellant's counsel who reacted exaggeratedly to the RPD member's request by insinuating that the member was [translation] \"mistrustful.\"\n[22] The hearing was virtual, over Microsoft Teams. Virtual hearings present new challenges for appellants, counsel, interpreters and the Board. The RPD could not directly ensure that the appellant, in a teleconference, did not have notes, as it could have done if he had testified before it. If the RPD had a doubt and wanted to check what was in front of the appellant, it had no other choice than to ask him to confirm that he did not have notes. It could ask him to show his surroundings.\n[23] The RPD first asked the appellant whether he was using notes. Its intervention was not excessive, and its behaviour did not raise any reasonable apprehension of bias, nor did it lead to any breach of procedural fairness. I emphasize that counsel's comment during the hearing on the RPD being mistrustful was not useful.\n[24] The second time the RPD asked to confirm that the appellant did not have notes, counsel asked the RPD to recuse itself. The RPD had no reason to recuse itself.\n[25] When the RPD asked him what had led him to Christianity, the appellant spontaneously and very fluidly recited a long surah from the Quran. The RPD then asked him whether he was reciting by heart. It explained that it had the impression that he was reading what he recited. The counsel then reacted strongly, saying that the RPD member was very mistrustful, that the appellant had no papers in front of him, that it was the second time that the RPD had attacked his client's credibility, that he was going to accuse him of bias, that it made no sense and that he was going to ask him to recuse himself. The RPD member responded to counsel that he could ask the person for [translation] \"a 360-degree camera view\" if he had the impression that the client was reading something and that he refused to recuse himself.17 Whether or not the member knew the surah does not change my conclusion. This changes nothing from the fact that he believed that the appellant was looking at a paper.\n[26] Whether the hearing is in person or virtual, a refugee protection claimant must not read their Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) or their notes during the hearing without obtaining the member's authorization. If the member has doubts, it is logical for the member to ask the person or their counsel for verification. An informed person, having thought the matter through, would not conclude that asking someone twice whether a person is reading their notes during a hearing that lasted more than 2.30 hours is excessive. The person also could not conclude that the RPD would not render a fair decision simply because it verified that the hearing was being held properly.18 The RPD had no reason to recuse itself. Throughout the hearing, it asked its clear questions, repeated them as required and kept an open mind.\nCounsel's statements at the hearing\n[27] At the time of making his submissions, the appellant's counsel made inappropriate statements about the member's supposed faith. The appellant reiterated nearly all of these statements in his appeal memorandum to support his allegations of bias. He states that the RPD had a closed mind and focused on religious elements that were much less important than the elements associated with his assault and his freedom of conscience.\n[28] The counsel explained to the RPD that he believed that the latter's faith had influenced the hearing. He detailed his concerns and made a long argument tainted by preconceptions, made shocking statements about physical aspects of the member, such as his skin colour, or the fact that he wore a beard. He made inappropriate statements on Islam and the Muslims of the world, which he reproduced in his memorandum:\n[Translation]\nSo that's the problem Mr. Board member, so I have trouble seeing why there would be any doubt that you're a devout practising Muslim, as your appearance seems to suggest, that you could have an appearance of bias because, in fact, you could never accept a person who tells you that they renounced Islam and, additionally, the person tells you that Islam is a false religion and that they converted for example or became an atheist. It's a big problem, because a lot of what we see at the international level, many Muslims, especially practising ones, do not accept any criticism of Islam, do not accept for example someone destroying the Quran or tearing out a page or anything of the sort. Therefore, these people in the world get accused of blasphemy by people who are practising Muslims and that leads me to doubt and that leads me to raise a question.\"19\n[29] I did not identify at the hearing or in his reasons any bias from the member with respect to the appellant's faith or his conversion. If there was a doubt about whether the appellant was reading a document while testifying, he could ask him for a verification. Whether or not the RPD knew the surah from the Quran in question does not change my opinion since it was not on this basis that it asked the appellant to confirm that he was not reading a document.\n[30] Despite what happened at the end of the hearing, I am not of the opinion that this raised an issue of procedural fairness for the appellant since it occurred after the questioning had finished and his counsel was making his representations. An informed person, having thought the matter through, would not conclude that this incident prevented the RPD from rendering a fair decision.\nThe conflict between the member and the counsel\n[31] On listening to the hearing and reading the appeal memorandum, I note a conflict between the Board member and the counsel. At the hearing, the counsel criticized the member for not having rendered a decision in another of the counsel's files.20 I therefore wondered whether this conflict had generated an appearance of bias from the member.\n[32] The RPD's questions were respectful, it demonstrated patience and asked the appellant to explain certain omissions or contradictions that it thought it had found between the BOC Form and the appellant's testimony. It asked the appellant questions about his path to Christianity, his practice of the religion in Algeria and the events of XXXX 2017. These are all important elements that are relevant to the analysis of the file of the appellant who alleges that his fear is based on his conversion. The surah from the Quran was recited on the appellant's initiative and not following a question from the RPD about Islam. The appellant is the one who recited this surah when the RPD asked him what had pushed him toward Christianity.21 Since the appellant states that he left Islam to join Christianity, it is logical for the RPD to wonder whether he knew by heart a passage from the holy book of a religion that the appellant chose to abandon.\n[33] The appellant was questioned by the RPD on its concerns and its conclusions regarding the elements on which it based its decision. It listened to the appellant, repeated questions that were unclear and ensured that he understood the questions. It ensured that it understood the appellant's answers when the interpretation was cut off by sound problems. It proceeded informally and quickly, and took measures that were useful to the proceeding.22 The RPD reviewed the appellant's file with an open mind. The fact that the RPD may have committed errors in analyzing the appellant's credibility does not lead to a breach of procedural fairness.\n[34] \"What would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude? Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly?\"\n[35] Not only would an informed person not call into question the member's impartiality at the hearing, but also, they would be impressed by his calm in the circumstances. The inappropriate behaviour and hostile environment were the work of the appellant's counsel and not the RPD. Even though the RPD's decision has errors, I have corrected them and the RPD did not have to recuse itself.\nCredibility findings\n[36] The appellant states that the RPD accepted his conversion but did not render a decision on the credible facts.\n[37] At the beginning of its reasons, the RPD states that the appellant testified openly and spontaneously, but that it noticed a few contradictions and omissions that seriously undermined his credibility. These two statements are contradictory, and the rest of the reasons do not elucidate how the appellant could at the same time testify openly and spontaneously, and not be credible.\n[38] The RPD did not really conclude on the appellant's path to conversion. It found that the letter from XXXX, a friend of the appellant, contradicts his testimony at the hearing and that this undermines his credibility. However, that is not the case. The letter from XXXX does not contradict his testimony. He testifies that he was present at the appellant's baptism, that he lost contact with the pastor, that brothers and sisters were victims of assault, that the appellant told him that he was assaulted on XXXX XXXX, 2017, after he exited the church, and that his family then learned of his conversion. He confirms that he went to XXXX XXXX and that he did not find the pastor. This error is not determinative since I remedied the RPD's errors.\n[39] In his BOC Form, the appellant explains that he was a Muslim by birth and that he started to become interested in Christianity in 2015. He explains that for him, Islam is a religion of violence, and Jesus is a religion of peace. He was baptized on XXXX XXXX, 2015, at the XXXX XXXX church, then attended the church in XXXX XXXX. One day, when he was leaving the church, a group of Islamist fanatics attacked the pilgrims leaving the church. He escaped. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, he was offered a ride home upon leaving church. He was attacked and asked if he was Christian. He was struck, and the individuals took him back to the road. He went to the hospital with his father. When he left the hospital, he went to the police to file a complaint. The officers did not help him and told him that there was no place for people like him in Algeria. He never returned to the church. He applied for a visa for France, which would be refused. His father asked him to return to Islam to protect himself. The appellant refused. He travelled to Canada with his father in XXXX 2018.\n[40] At the hearing, the appellant testified that he began to be interested in Christianity with his friend XXXX in 2014. He specified that, from 2015 to the incident in XXXX 2017, he went to church every Saturday. He stated that he first attended the church in XXXX XXXX, then later the church in XXXX XXXX.\nEvidence filed by the appellant\n[41] The appellant states that the RPD does not mention the letter from the appellant's father in its reasons; he challenges the analysis of XXXX letter and criticizes the RPD for not considering all the evidence. I therefore conducted an independent analysis of this evidence.\nXXXX written testimony\n[42] XXXX written testimony states that the appellant was baptized on XXXX XXXX, 2015, which is consistent with the BOC Form and the appellant's testimony. He then writes that the appellant did not return to church with him and that, [translation] \"since many of our brothers and sisters were victims of physical and verbal assaults, I also lost contact with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\". This assertion does not contradict the testimony of the appellant, who explained at the hearing and stated in his BOC Form that he instead went to the church in XXXX XXXX.\n[43] XXXX then writes that the appellant informed him that he was assaulted in 2017. Since XXXX did not witness these facts, his letter cannot corroborate them. This can merely corroborate the fact that the appellant told him that he was attacked. The rest of the letter states that the appellant tried to reach the pastor in XXXX XXXX, and that no one knows where he is.\n[44] The appellant has established that he was baptized in 2015. The letter from XXXX corroborates the appellant's testimony and BOC Form that he converted in 2015 and was baptized.\nCertificate of baptism\n[45] The appellant states that he wonders about the link between the [translation] \"so-called contradictions\" in the appellant's testimony and the conclusion that the certificate of baptism and the letter from the father have no weight.\n[46] The appellant is asking me to analyze the probative value of the baptism certificate. I reviewed the document. I note that it is in French, while the official language of Algeria is Arabic and that in Kabylia, Kabyle is spoken. I also note several spelling mistakes such as the French word registre (regsitre) [registry], the name of the city of XXXX (XXXX), the month of December, d\u00e9cembre (d\u00e9cemebre) and especially the word XXXX instead of XXXX in the email address. For these reasons, I cannot confirm that this document is authentic. Despite that, this is insufficient to cast doubt on my finding that the appellant was baptized in 2015, based on his and XXXX testimony.\nLetter from the appellant's father\n[47] The appellant is asking me to analyze the probative value of his father's letter. This letter confirms that the appellant was the victim of a violent assault on XXXX XXXX, 2017, by guardians of the Muslim faith in a completely isolated location, that he recounted everything that night to his father, who recommended he go file a complaint with the police, that he did not accept his son's conversion, but that to protect him, he told him to forsake Christianity and attend mosque, that he accompanied him to Canada and told him not to come back.\n[48] The letter from the appellant's father corroborates what his son told him; namely, that he was attacked once by the guardians of the Muslim faith, that he did not appreciate his son's conversion and that he helped him come to Canada, not hesitating to accompany him there.\nMedical certificate and surgical report\n[49] The appellant filed a medical certificate dated XXXX XXXX, 2017, which states that he was examined for [translation] \"blows and injuries further to an assault with weapons\". The certificate does not mention the severity of the injuries. The certificate has weight to establish that the appellant went to the hospital and suffered injuries further to an assault.\n[50] The appellant filed a surgical report that states that he suffered a [translation] \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX\" when he was XXXX years old, on XXXX XXXX, 2001. The document has no probative value or weight to establish that the appellant was injured after the attack in 2017 or the nature of the injuries in question.\n[51] The RPD faulted the appellant for not having filed a letter from the pastor of the church in XXXX XXXX. It is true that the best evidence to corroborate regular attendance at the XXXX XXXX XXXX church would have been a letter from the pastor in XXXX XXXX or from a person who attended the church and\/or who reportedly knew of the assault. The appellant's explanation that he saw on the television that the church had been closed is adequate to explain the absence of a letter from the pastor, but it does not explain why the appellant did not try to find other testimony. However, I do not draw a negative inference from the absence of a letter from the pastor corroborating the appellant's allegations.\n[52] The appellant's testimony is consistent with his BOC Form on some aspects of his refugee protection claim. Some documentary evidence corroborates these aspects. The appellant has established that he was baptized in 2015, that he attended church weekly since 2015, that his parents learned of his conversion, that his father did not [translation] \"appreciate\" his conversion, that he was attacked in XXXX 2017, and that he tried to file a complaint.\nThe appellant's path, his knowledge of his new religion, his practice in Algeria and in Canada\n[53] The appellant asked how his testimony was superficial, and pointed out that he cited passages from the Bible and the life of Jesus, which indicates that the RPD was acting in bad faith. He added that even if he had insufficient knowledge of Christianity, he has a right to his freedom of conscience and asked who decides on the necessary quantity of information to be convinced that Islam is bad or if Christianity is good. He specified that the RPD was not questioning the reasons that justified the appellant no longer believing in Islam.\n[54] The RPD asked questions at the hearing23 about what attracted the appellant to Christianity. It concluded that he remained very superficial when it asked him what had marked him the most in his new faith, and he limited himself to reiterating the messages of peace and love, that the religion recommends loving one's neighbour, that Jesus said to turn the other cheek or again that he begged that the people who crucified him be forgiven.\n[55] The RPD could review what motivated the appellant to practise his new religion. His answers to the questions were vague and superficial. He did not really explain why the messages of peace and love in his new religion had reached him. He testified that he had been interested in Christianity since 2014, that his faith pushed him toward Christianity, that what led him to make his decision is that Islam is not a just religion and that Christianity is a religion of justice.24 He also did not explain his spiritual journey.\n[56] The RPD questioned the appellant about his knowledge of Christianity and about his practice.25 It concluded that it had no reason to doubt the veracity of the ritual and prayer that the appellant talked about, but that his knowledge is superficial and known to the general public, that it is reasonable to expect that he would have more knowledge of his new religion especially since he claimed to have regularly attended church, every XXXX from 2015 to 2017. It added that he was able to recite a specific surah from the Quran and the verse number in Arabic and translated into Kabyle. It was of the opinion that it would therefore be reasonable to expect that in the same manner, he could have more knowledge of his new faith.\n[57] The appellant states that he joined a religion for which he could be persecuted in Algeria, and yet his testimony on his knowledge of his new religion was vague. Since he has allegedly been a convert since 2015 and attended a church regularly, it is therefore logical to expect that he would know the most basic elements of it in order to assess his credibility. Since he alleges that he went to church weekly for two years, he must be well aware of the practices and principles of his new religion. For example, when the RPD asked him to describe the Saturday activities, the appellant replied that they sang songs, that the pastor would preach the word, and that the word was to follow the religion of peace, to love one's neighbour and to turn the other cheek.26 I consider this information to be vague and known to the general public.\n[58] While the Federal Court27 instructs that a person who says that he is persecuted because of his religious beliefs must be familiar with the basic information relating to this religious belief, I am of the opinion that the appellant has established that he converted to Christianity in 2015, and that he regularly attended his church in XXXX XXXX until his departure in 2017. In his particular case, his vague answers are insufficient to conclude that he did not convert, especially because of the corroborating evidence filed by the appellant. However, the vague nature of his responses does lead me to conclude that he is not very engaged in practising his Christianity.\nThe harm the appellant faced before his departure from Algeria\nThe attack in XXXX 2017\n[59] The appellant states that the XXXX 2017 attack is the most significant event that triggered his departure from Algeria. The RPD questioned him about this event without drawing a conclusion.\n[60] The appellant's testimony at the hearing on the circumstances of this attack was consistent with his BOC Form. He has established that he was attacked by unknown individuals in XXXX 2017 when he was leaving church in XXXX XXXX.\nThe appellant omitted the threats in his community from his BOC Form\n[61] The appellant states that the RPD was wrong to find that he omitted stating in his BOC Form that he encountered harassment, threats and insults, and that people would spit on him, after his conversion became known in his community. He states that its analysis is misleading, [translation] \"in order to justify a lack of credibility on a minor point, and then he generalizes the lack of credibility to all of the evidence and testimony\".\n[62] At the hearing, the appellant stated that he received threats in his community and when he went to university, people would insult him and spit on him.28 He does not mention anything in his BOC Form.\n[63] The RPD correctly concluded that the omission from his BOC Form that he endured threats in the community undermines the credibility of these allegations.\n[64] The appellant testified that after he was beaten, when everyone had heard that he had converted, people would spit on him. He does not mention it in his BOC Form. However, this information is important. If such acts of discrimination and hatred took place, they are essential in the analysis of the risk of persecution since they are an ongoing element that allegedly occurred in the community when everyone found out about his conversion. Since he states that he would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution by reason of his conversion, the RPD must assess all of the acts of harassment or discrimination that occurred and which, cumulatively, can amount to persecution. The appellant had to mention this information at the core of his refugee protection claim in his BOC Form, which he did not do.\n[65] When refugee protection claimants complete their BOC Forms, they must include everything that is important to their claim; the form clearly indicates this in capital letters. It is risky not to disclose in the initial BOC Form all of the facts and details that are significant to a claim for refugee protection,29 and the appellant must provide a convincing explanation to justify the omissions.\n[66] In this case, the appellant replied to the RPD that he did not think of that,30 which is not an adequate explanation, especially since he had been represented by counsel at the time of signing his BOC Form, since he did not amend his written account before the hearing, and since he failed to do so at the beginning of the hearing.\n[67] The threats, acts of discrimination and hatred suffered in his community are an element at the core of the appellant's refugee protection claim since he states that this is what motivated his departure from Algeria after the XXXX 2017 attack. This omission in the BOC Form undermines the appellant's credibility on the fact that he received threats and suffered harassment in his community after his conversion became known to everyone.\n[68] Contrary to what the appellant asserts, the RPD's conclusion is not misleading. The threats are also not a minor point in his refugee protection claim. The appellant has not established on a balance of probabilities that after the event of XXXX XXXX, 2017, he suffered threats or acts of harassment or discrimination in his community.\nThe appellant has not established that he would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution\n[69] The appellant states that the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP), as well as the abundant documentation that he submitted on the situation of Christians and the situation of Christian converts in Algeria, establishes that he cannot return to his country, that he could not practise his religion freely and could be charged with blasphemy. He states that the most significant event is the attack of XXXX XXXX, 2017, the police reaction and his father's request to return to Islam.\n[70] I reviewed the appellant's situation in light of the documentary evidence. The facts established by the appellant are the following:\n[71] The appellant has established that he has been a convert since 2015 and that he was interested in Christianity since 2014. After his baptism in XXXX 2015, he practised in the XXXX XXXX church for two years, going to activities every Saturday. He was attacked once in XXXX 2017 by unknown individuals who criticized him for attending church, when he was leaving the church. He suffered injuries and went to the police station with his father, without his complaint being accepted. After this event, his father and his community learned of his conversion. He lived with his parents until his departure one year later, on XXXX XXXX, 2018. He did not allege any event from XXXX 2017 to XXXX 2018. He travelled to Canada and his father accompanied him.\n[72] Documentary evidence concerning the general situation prevailing in the refugee protection claimant's country cannot, in and of itself, establish the merit of his refugee protection claim.31 The appellant must demonstrate a credible link between the documentary evidence and his personal situation, which he did not do.32\nAlgerian Christians\n[73] Some sources estimate that Algeria has a community of 20,000 to 200,000 Christians, while others estimate 125,000, out of a population of 42.3 million.33 According to Algerian government officials and religious leaders, most of them are foreign immigrants or students.\n[74] The appellant, like most Algerian Christians, is Protestant. The Christians live primarily in the Algiers region, the Kabyle region of Bejaia, the provinces of XXXX XXXX (XXXX XXXX XXXX), Annaba, Ouargla and Oran.\nThe appellant's religious practice and churches\n[75] The evidence reveals that, since 2017, the Algerian government has closed and raided churches, and that the situation has allegedly worsened since 2019, the year during which the government reportedly closed three of the largest Protestant churches in the country. Parishioners protested against these closures and may have been arrested by the authorities.34\n[76] The appellant is a Christian convert who is not very engaged in his new religion. Nothing indicates that he could not return to church on Saturday as he did before. He was able to attend church without issues every Saturday for two years (from 2015 to 2017). Despite the closure of some churches since his departure, which represents a restriction for Christians, 12 of the 45 churches of the \u00c9glise Protestante d'Alg\u00e9rie (EPA) [Association of Protestant Churches of Algeria] are still closed.35 He could therefore attend one of the 33 churches that remain open.\nDiscrimination against Christians in Algeria\n[77] According to the documentary evidence, Algerian society acts with intolerance and discrimination against Christians.36 According to many sources, they are exposed to neither population movements nor physical assaults and must deal with the societal pressure exerted by other family members. Other sources report that they must overcome administrative obstacles imposed by the Algerian authorities, such as very long delays to obtain biblical names for their children.\n[78] Overall, the evidence does not allow for the conclusion that just being a Christian in Algeria would expose the appellant to a serious possibility of persecution. Christians in Algeria may face discrimination without the impact of these discriminatory acts being tantamount to persecution.37 They may encounter some obstacles to practising their faith, face discrimination from the government or the general public, but they are not subjected to a serious possibility of persecution from the sole fact of being Christians. For a person to be recognized as a refugee because they would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution on the grounds of their religion, they must establish that they would suffer serious acts of discrimination, that their fundamental rights are threatened or that the harms suffered are repetitive, ongoing or systematic.\n[79] The appellant states in his BOC Form that his conversion [translation] \"disturbed his family\". He did not establish any act of discrimination or hatred from his family or his community. He did not allege that his right to work, his right to health care (he was received at the hospital) or any of his other basic rights were restricted. For one year (from XXXX 2017 to XXXX 2018), he continued to live in his community. Even though his father asked him to return to Islam, and though he testified in writing that he did not [translation] \"appreciate\" his son's conversion, the appellant did not allege that his family had committed discriminatory or harassing acts. He continued to live in his father's home and in his community. The fact that his father did not appreciate his conversion is insufficient to establish that, if the appellant were to return to Algeria, he would experience discrimination or persecution from his family or his community.\n[80] Despite the discrimination that Algerian Christians may suffer, the appellant did not allege any acts of discrimination from his community from 2015 to 2018. He was able to freely practise his religion until XXXX 2017 and lived there for the year between the time his conversion came to light and his departure for Canada. He was baptized in 2015, after having started to attend Christian church in 2014. For three years, he suffered no acts of discrimination or persecution in association with his new faith. He suffered one attack when he was leaving church in 2017 and was injured. This attack alone does not equate to persecution. After this attack, all of his community, as well as his family, learned of his conversion. Despite that, he suffered no acts of discrimination until he left for Canada, although he continued to live with his parents. His father asked him to return to Islam without rejecting him since he continued to house his son and even accompanied him to Canada.\n[81] In light of the evidence, and contrary to what other Algerian Christian converts like him may experience, the appellant has not established that he suffered situations of intolerance or discrimination in his community. He has not established that he suffered other acts of violence or discrimination before his departure for Canada, although he testified that, after the XXXX 2017 incident, everyone knew that he had converted. He has not established that he would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution on the sole ground that he is an Algerian Christian convert.\nThe XXXX 2017 attack and the police complaint\n[82] The appellant suffered a single attack in three years (from 2014 to 2017). The fact that he was attacked once after the service by unknown individuals who claimed to be defenders of the Muslim faith does not allow me to conclude that the appellant experienced discrimination to the point that it could be considered persecution, nor that he experienced events that were sufficiently serious by their nature and repetition for them to constitute a serious violation of a fundamental human right or for that to present a \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights\" of the appellant.\n[83] The appellant was attacked by individuals whom his father described as, [translation] \"guardians of the Muslim faith\" in a completely isolated location.38 This unfortunate event that should not have happened remains an isolated event. Even though the appellant's left arm was injured, his assailants released him.\n[84] In his BOC Form, the appellant alleges that he explained everything to the police and that instead of helping him, they asked him, [translation] \"what I expected in a Muslim country\" and stated that it was his fault if Muslims had attacked him. I do not believe that a police officer's refusal means that the state could not adequately protect the appellant.\n[85] According to the report from the British Home Office, the gendarmerie police forces are made up of 330,000 people.39 It is probable that in the whole police force, or military, individuals may display negligent behaviour. According to the documentary evidence, an individual can also file a complaint with the public prosecutor.40 By itself, the refusal by the local police to take his complaint is insufficient to conclude that state protection was not adequate or that it will not be if the appellant were to return to Algeria.\nBlasphemy and proselytism\n[86] Although Algeria's constitution allows freedom of conscience and religion, Islam is the state religion. Algerians may practise their religion, but offending or insulting Islam is blasphemous. Blasphemy and proselytism are crimes.\n[87] The appellant states that he could be charged with blasphemy, because he explained that he decided to leave Islam because it is a religion that promotes violence, whereas Christianity is a religion of peace. Other than this statement, nothing in the evidence indicates to me that if the appellant returned to Algeria, he could be charged with blasphemy. He was baptized in 2015 and practised for two years without incident, except for a single attack by unknown individuals. It is unlikely that he would be charged with blasphemy if he were to return to his community.\n[88] As for the allegations that he could be charged with proselytism, he clearly testified at the hearing that he never carried out activities to convert people.41 It is unlikely that he would do so if he were to return to Algeria.\nThe appellant has not established that he would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution on religious grounds if he were to return to Algeria.\n[89] The appellant has established that he has been a Christian convert since 2015, that he regularly attended church until an attack by unknown [translation] \"fundamentalists\" in XXXX 2017 when he was leaving church. After that date, and before his departure for Canada in XXXX 2018, he has not established that he experienced additional acts of violence or discrimination based on his religion. The documentary evidence does not allow for the conclusion that all Algerian Christian converts are subjected to persecution. If the appellant were to return to Algeria, nothing indicates that he would be unable to practise his faith, that he would be subjected to serious acts of discrimination, that his fundamental rights would be threatened or that he would be subjected to repeated, ongoing or systematic harm.\n[90] The appellant's risk is a mere possibility and not a serious possibility of persecution.\n[91] The RPD decision is correct. The appellant has not established that he would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution on religious grounds if he were to return to Algeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[92] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the determination of the RPD that the appellant, XXXX XXXX, is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMe Agn\u00e8s Connat\nMe Agn\u00e8s Connat\nFebruary 2, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 P-2, Appellant's record, appellant's appeal memorandum, paragraph 76.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, subsection 110(4).\n3 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Appellant fears that, if he were to return to India, he would be killed or seriously harmed by the Punjabi police or members of the Congress or Akali Dal Badal parties. The Appellant was arrested for the first time in 2016 when he protested the sacrilege of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The police alleged that he had links to terrorists and they beat and tortured him. He was released upon payment of a bribe. The Appellant claimed to have been active for the Am Adami Party in 2017 and that he was threatened by members of the Akali Dal and beaten up by members of the Congress Party. After this attack he did not participate in any political activity. The Appellant alleged that he was arrested a second time in 2018 and again the police made up allegations that he was associated with terrorists. He was again beaten and tortured and released upon the payment of a bribe. With the help of an agent, the Appellant left India for Canada to claim refugee protection in or around December 2018.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellant's claim on the basis that he has a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Mumbai or Bengaluru.\nDECISION\n[4] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1 Having reviewed all of the evidence in the case, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant would have a viable IFA in Mumbai or Bangaluru.\nANALYSIS\nAppellant has a viable IFAs\n[5] International refugee protection is surrogate (that is, substitute) protection that only comes into play if a claimant does not have an IFA in their country of citizenship. The onus is on the Appellants to demonstrate that they do not have a viable IFA in their home country-in other words, a location to which he could relocate where he could live without experiencing persecution or the kind of serious harm that would make him a person in need of protection. The IFA analysis contains two prongs.2\n(1) the decision maker must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the internal flight alternative location or a likelihood that he would be subjected personally to one of the types of harm that would make him a person in need of protection there.\n(2) the conditions in the part of the country under consideration must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the appellant to seek refuge there. The threshold for unreasonableness is a very high one and requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.3\nFirst prong of the IFA test\n[6] I do not agree with the submissions of the Appellant's representative as to why he believes the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant had a viable IFA in Mumbai and Bengaluru.\n[7] I do not accept the representative's argument that the RPD failed to take into account the Appellant's testimony that the police had raided his house to arrest him in XXXX 2019 and XXXX 2021. The Appellant's information about these alleged raids came from the village Sarpanch who swore an affidavit in which he essentially repeated the claims set out in the Appellant's Basis of Claim narrative and stated, \"the police still looking for him to arrest him and raided on XXXX-XXXX-2019 and XXXX XXXX XXXX-2021.\"4 There is no information in the affidavit as to how the sarpanch became aware of these raids. In addition, I note that the Appellant gave inconsistent evidence about who he lived with in his home village before leaving India. He first testified that he lived with a friend and then said he lived with his father, mother, and brother.5 This despite the fact that, in his narrative, he claimed that his mother left his father due to abuse in 2015 and was never seen thereafter. In any event, even if I were to accept as credible for the purposes of this decision that the police decided to raid the Appellant's home over a year after his 2018 arrest and then two years later, these raids are not sufficient to establish that the Punjab police would have the motivation to track the Appellant down and persecute him in the IFA cities if he were to return there today.\n[8] I disagree with the representative's argument that the RPD ignored the fact that the Appellant is a supporter of Shiromani Akali Dal Mann, a party that supports the achievement of an independent Khalistan. In fact, the Appellant's evidence was that he had always supported the Akali Dal Mann party but that he supported the Am Adami Party in the 2017 Assembly elections and that he was not politically active after he was allegedly attacked by Akali Dal Badal members in 2017. Therefore, I do not accept that the fact that the Appellant may have been an Akali Dal Mann supporter sometime before 2017 is sufficient to establish that there is a serious possibility that the police or anyone else would have the motivation to track him down and persecute him if he were to return to one of the IFA cities today.\n[9] I also do not agree with the Appellant's representative that his allegations about being arrested twice, once in 2016 and again in 2018, are sufficient to establish that he cannot live safely anywhere in India. In a very large number of cases, both the RAD and the Federal Court have upheld RPD decisions in cases such as the present in which the Appellant has alleged being arrested, tortured by Punjab police and subjected to allegations of association with terrorists. In each case, it is necessary to examine all of the evidence to determine whether the Appellant has met their onus of establishing that there is a serious possibility that the alleged agents of persecution would track the appellant down and persecute them in the IFA cities. In this case, I do not agree with the Appellant's representative that the Appellant's arrests in 2016 and 2018 are sufficient to establish that the police or anyone from the Congress or Akali Dal Badal parties would have the means or motivation to track him down and persecute him in the IFA cities if he returns there today.\n[10] Likewise, I do not agree with the Appellant's representative that the RPD ignored the Appellant's testimony that he believes that the police would track him in the IFA cities if he were to relocate there. In almost every case, appellants testify to a subjective belief that their agents of harm would be able to track them down all over their country. However, such a subjective belief is insufficient to establish a serious possibility that the agents of persecution would objectively have the means and motivation to track them down and persecute them in the IFA cities if they returned there today.\n[11] The Appellant's representative goes on to repeat all of the arguments he made before the RPD about why he believes the agents of persecution in this case would have both the means and motivation to track the Appellant down in the IFA cities due to the tenant registration system, police and government databases, and the Appellant's identification card. The Appellant's representative repeats the arguments he made before the RPD and seeks to rely upon the many news articles he submitted to the RPD. The Appellant's representative argues that the RPD ignored his arguments and documentary evidence showing that tenant registration is mandatory and police stations are interconnected by databases to track criminals.\n[12] I see no sign that the RPD ignored the arguments made, or the evidence submitted, by the Appellant's representative. The RPD acknowledged that the tenant verification system exists but relied upon documentary evidence that indicated that the police do not have the resources to follow up on the number of tenant verification forms they receive. The RPD also noted that the tenant verification system is intended to locate criminals and terrorists, which is not the Appellant's case as there was never any warrant issued for his arrest or notice for him to appear in court.\n[13] In my view, the RPD was correct to conclude that the existence of the tenant registration system and police databases were insufficient to establish that there is a serious possibility that the Punjab police or members of the congress or Akali Dal Badal parties would track the Appellant and persecute him in the IFA cities today. However, I would note that the RPD did err in stating that \"the tenant registration system does not allow the Mumbai or Bengaluru police to communicate with the Punjab police\" and that \"it similarly does not allow the Punjab police to find the Claimant in Mumbai and Bengaluru.\"6 Despite the lack of any argument by the Appellant's representative on this poin, it is worth pointing out that this wording by the RPD is inaccurate. It is not that the tenant registration system \"does not allow,\" for police forces to communicate. Instead, the issue is that the existence of the tenant registration system and police databases do not, by themselves, establish a serious possibility that these police forces will be in communication about a particular appellant.\n[14] Evidence in the NDP for India indicates that the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) is in use in an increasing number of police stations and that there is a system of tenant verification in India that is mandatory.7 However, the evidence on police datases and the tenant registration system is mixed. For example, the evidence indicates that there are insufficient resources for the police to follow up on all tenant verification forms due to the volume of internal migration within India.8 In addition, the evidence also states that police systems between districts and states are not integrated, thus creating \"islands of technology\" which can only communicate within a state or district.9 Moreover, the evidence in the NDP for India indicates that there is little interstate police communications except in cases of major crimes like smuggling, terrorism, and some high-profile organized crime.10\n[15] In this case, the Appellant alleged that the police arrested him twice and alleged he was associated with terrorists. However, they released him upon the payment of a bribe both times and there was no evidence that the police ever registered a First Information Report against him or charged him with any crime. There was also no evidence to establish that his name appears in the CCTNS database or any other police or government database. When all of this evidence is weighed, I do not find that the Appellant has made out his onus of establishing that there is a serious possibility that the police would have the means to track him using the tenant registration system or the CCTNS database.\n[16] As for the Central Monitoring System (CMS) mentioned by the Appellant's representative, I do not agree that the evidence establishes that there is a serious possibility that the police or any members of the Congress or Akali Dal Badal parties would track the Appellant down through the CMS.11 The documentation in the NDP indicates that (i) \"no public documentation exists to explain the scope, functions and technical architecture of the CMS,\"12 and (ii) only eleven government agencies have authorization to make intercept requests through the CMS, and none of the agencies listed are state police.13 Therefore, I find that the evidence does not establish a serious possibility that the Punjab police or any members of the Congress or Akali Dal Badal parties would be able to use the CMS to track the Appellant in the IFA cities.\n[17] I do not accept the arguments made by the Appellant's representative based on the fact that the Sikhs make up only 2% of the population of India or his arguments based on the raid on the Golden Temple complex in 1982. Notwithstanding the army's raid on the Golden Temple forty years ago, Sikhs have been able to live peacefully since the late 1980s and 1990s. Even if Sikhs do make up roughly 2% of the population in India, the documentary evidence indicates that, in general, Sikhs are able to live safely despite instances of localized discrimination.14\n[18] I also do not agree with the Appellant's representative that the RPD ignored the various online news articles submitted by the Appellant on a variety of subjects from police corruption, the drug trade in India, or instances in which Sikhs were attacked by Hindus, the police or others in India. The RPD did not ignore these online articles, instead it correctly preferred to accord more weight to the documentary evidence contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India which indicates that Sikhs are generally able to relocate and live safely in cities outside Punjab. I would add that this finding has generally been upheld in the RAD and Federal Court's case law,15 absent evidence that is capable of establishing that a particular appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution due to their particular profile. The simple fact that there have been certain attacks on Sikhs in different parts of India is insufficient to establish a serious possibility that that the agents of persecution or anyone else will subject the Appellant to persecution if he were to relocate to the IFA cities today.\n[19] Finally, I do not agree with the Appellant's representative that the Appellant would face a serious possibility of persecution due to his support for an independent Khalistan. It is true that sources in the NDP for India indicate that Sikhs who advocate for an independent Khalistan may be the subject of attention or harassment by authorities.16 Although the Appellant testified that he supported an independent Khalistan, he has not been politically active for almost five years. Overall, I do not find that the evidence establishes a serious possibility that the Punjab police, members of the Akali Dal Badal or Congress parties or anyone else would track the Appellant down in the IFA cities and persecute him there due to any political opinion he may hold in support of an independent Khalistan.\nSecond prong of the IFA test\n[20] The only argument that the Appellant's representative made with respect to the second prong of the IFA test was that the Appellant testified that the police and government would kill him due to \"fake excuses of Coronavirus.\"17 The Appellant's representative is referring to the Appellant's assertion at the hearing that he believed that \"on the name of Corona, my body parts will be taken out and the rest of my body will put in a bag and sent to my village.\"18 The Appellant provided no objective evidence to support this speculative belief about what the Indian authorities might do to him due to the coronavirus. Therefore, I do not agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred in finding that he had failed to establish that it would be unreasonable, in the circumstances, to expect him to relocate to the IFA cities.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] For the above reasons, I deny the appeal and confirm the RPD's decision that XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJo-Anne Pickel\nJo-Anne Pickel\nJanuary 7, 2022\nDate\nJP\/tm\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The PA is the daughter of the AA and the mother of the MFA.\n[3] The Appellants fear harm at the hands of police officers and government agents who, in 2017, wanted the PA to poison Mr. XXXX, an independent political candidate for whose campaign the PA XXXX. The police officers threatened to kill the PA's entire family if she did not comply. The adult Appellants also allege that they were assaulted due to their affiliation to Mr. XXXX. These events occurred in late 2017, and prompted the Appellants to flee to the United States of America (USA) in early XXXX 2018. In late XXXX 2018, they arrived in Canada, irregularly. Mr. XXXX also now resides in Canada and was granted refugee protection in May 2021.\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Appellants were nationals of Rwanda and Kenya, and that they failed to establish either section 96 or section 97 harm in both of these countries.\n[5] The Appellants submit that there was a breach of their right to procedural fairness because they were not afforded a meaningful opportunity to respond to the allegations regarding their Rwandan nationality, and because their former counsel (FC) was incompetent. They further maintain that they face section 96 and\/or section 97 harm if returned to Rwanda or Kenya.\n[6] The determinative issue in this appeal is the Appellants' prospective risk of harm in Kenya. After reviewing all of the admissible evidence and submissions, I did not find a material breach of the Appellants' right to procedural fairness either by the FC or by the RPD Panel. The rules of natural justice have been met. Moreover, the Appellants failed to sufficiently establish a risk of prospective harm in Kenya.\nDECISION\n[7] I dismiss the appeals. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nPROCEDURAL FAIRNESS AND NEW EVIDENCE\nThe test for admitting new evidence\n[8] According to the law,1 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[9] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.2\nSelected portions of the new evidence are admissible\n[10] A focal aspect of this appeal is the Appellants' submissions regarding procedural fairness. They submit that they were not afforded an opportunity to meaningfully respond to the issue of their Rwandan nationality. They also contend that due to inadequate representation, several relevant documents were not submitted to the RPD.\n[11] As a result, the new evidence that they intend to rely upon can be broadly divided into two categories: (i) documents seeking to establish a procedural fairness infringement and (ii) documents going to the merits of the Appellants' refugee claims. I recognize that there is some overlap. For instance, the PA's affidavit seeks to explain both how the RPD's proceedings were unfair and how the other new documentation meets the legal test, mentioned above.\n[12] I find that the new evidence that falls into the first category is admissible, specifically:\ni. portions of the affidavit of the PA dated September 9, 2021 (paras. 6-20, 22-25, 27-29);\nii. portions of the affidavit of the AA dated September 9, 2021 (paras. 5-6, 8-10);\niii. the affidavit of the PA dated October 7, 2021; and\niv. the letter to the Appellants' former counsel dated September 10, 2021\n[13] Under the circumstances, I find that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected to fully raise their procedural fairness argument prior to the RPD's decision. The aforementioned new evidence is credible as to source and circumstances (the documents are signed and dated), contain evidence that is relevant to the issue of procedural fairness, and are new.\n[14] The admissibility of the other new evidence (the remaining portions of the affidavits of the PA and AA, and the documents listed A to J in the Appellants' Record3) hinges on my decision regarding procedural fairness. These documents do not explain how the RPD proceedings were unfair and do not otherwise support their procedural fairness argument. Instead, they relate to the merits of the Appellants' refugee claims.\nAn oral hearing is not permitted\n[15] Although I have admitted some new evidence, it does not raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellants and would not, on its own, justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. Therefore, I am not permitted to hold an oral hearing, pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nThe Appellants' right to procedural fairness was not materially breached\n[16] When procedural fairness is raised as an issue, the proper approach is to ask whether the requirements of natural justice in the particular circumstances of the case have been met.4 In a claim for refugee protection, procedural fairness ensures that claimants understand the proceedings, have a reasonable opportunity to tender any evidence that supports their claims, and are given a chance to persuade the RPD that their claim is well-founded. Indeed, an allegation of inadequate representation goes to the issue of the claimants' right to fully present their case.\n[17] A breach of procedural fairness does not necessarily result in relief in every case. For instance, according to the case law, if it is apparent that the decision-maker would have reached the same decision notwithstanding the breach of procedural fairness, and no purpose would be achieved by referring the matter to the RPD for re-determination, the decision should stand.5\n[18] When inadequate representation is alleged, it must first be determined that counsel's actions or omissions constitute incompetence. Then, the claimant must establish that a miscarriage of justice resulted. Therefore, a finding of incompetence will only rise to the level of a breach of natural justice in extraordinary circumstances: it must be established that but for the conduct of counsel, the outcome of the RPD hearing would have been different.6\n[19] After reviewing the evidence and submissions, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the requirements of natural justice have been met in this case. I note the following facts, in particular:\ni. The Basis of Claim (BOC) form clearly indicates that claimants are responsible for providing supporting documentation. Claimants are also invited to provide a detailed description of whether they or their families have been harmed, mistreated, or threatened by any person or group.7\nii. The BOCs of the adult Appellants are accompanied by fulsome narratives, which detail an assault against the PA on XXXX XXXX, 2017, threats at gunpoint on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and a violent police encounter on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\niii. The Appellants were reasonably aware that their status in Rwanda would be an issue during the RPD proceedings. The AA's BOC form indicates that her current status in Rwanda is \"citizen\" and her narrative states that she fears returning to Rwanda.8 The PA's BOC refers to the AA as possessing both Kenyan and Rwandan citizenship.9 At the RPD hearing, after making several amendments to their BOC on their own initiative, the adult Appellants affirmed that their BOCs were complete, true, and correct. The adult Appellants do not require the use of an interpreter, speak and understand the English language, and have extensive work and academic backgrounds.10 These facts, considered cumulatively, make the Appellants' explanation - that they believed that only grammatical changes to their BOCs were permissible at the RPD hearing - unreasonable.\niv. The Appellants allege that they provided additional documentation to their FC at the second client meeting of April 30, 2021. The FC asserts that the decision to not disclose all of the documents to the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) was strategic, and borne out of suspicions of fraud. The FC triaged the provided documents, advising the Appellants to focus on those which directly support the allegations contained in their BOC forms. On May 5, 2021, the FC submitted twelve documents to the IRB.11 Under the circumstances, the FC's conduct was reasonable, and it did not constitute incompetence. For instance, this is not a case where the representative made assurances that all documentation would be submitted and failed to do so. It is also not a case where counsel did not submit any of the supporting documentation given to him, as such a decision could be construed as manifestly prejudicial to a claimant's interests. Instead, the Appellants' own evidence reveals that during the April 2021 client meeting, the FC canvassed and prioritized the documentation that directly referenced the Appellants. The Appellants blindly trusted the FC, and accepted his advice and strategic decisions.12 Five days later, the FC submitted selected documents to the IRB. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, the Appellants are objecting to the FC's decision-making.\nv. At the end of the RPD hearing, the FC spontaneously requested to submit post-hearing disclosure related to Mr. XXXX's political activities. The Panel granted this request.13 On May 21, 2021, this documentation was sent to the Tribunal.14\n[20] To be clear, legal representatives enjoy a wide latitude in advocating for their clients. Different representatives adopt different strategies. A representative's conduct must be analyzed globally, without the benefit of hindsight, and should not descend into a microscopic inquiry. The key concern from the perspective of the rules of natural justice is whether the Appellants were able to fully present their case.\n[21] The FC's representation clearly focussed on the Appellants' risk of harm in Kenya, as it relates to political violence. This is consistent with the fact that the Appellants were referred to the FC by Mr. XXXX - an acquaintance of the PA, a client of the FC, and a Kenyan politician who was subjected to political violence. Indeed, the Appellants' allegations primarily relate to their connection to Mr. XXXX.\n[22] In contrast, the Appellants' status in Rwanda appears to have been a peripheral consideration. This approach may have been reasonable if the FC held the position that none of the Appellants were Rwandan nationals or if there was demonstrable evidence that returning to Rwanda was impossible (e.g. an ongoing civil war). However, the FC has long maintained the position that the AA is eligible for Rwandan citizenship. This admission means that he was aware that the status of the AA - and, by extension, the status of the PA and the MFA - would likely be canvassed by the Panel. I note that the FC was informed by the IRB, prior to the hearing, that the National Documentation Packages (NDPs) for both Kenya and Rwanda would be relevant.15 It is trite law that if a claimant has multiple countries of reference, then a risk of section 96 or section 97 harm in all of those countries must be established in order to successfully claim refugee protection.\n[23] At the RPD hearing, the FC did not attempt to elicit any testimony or make meaningful submissions regarding the legal status of each Appellant in Rwanda. Instead, his stated strategy was to emphasize the AA's affinity to and extended residency in Kenya. Such factors are largely irrelevant in determining whether Rwanda is a valid country of reference, and whether the Appellants face a well-founded fear of persecution or risk of section 97 harm there.16\n[24] During the RPD hearing, the FC did give the PA another opportunity to explain why she believes that she cannot return to Rwanda. The FC also referred to the Appellants' prospective risk of harm in Rwanda in his closing submissions.17 However, the FC's failure to meaningfully engage with the threshold question - the Appellants' status in Rwanda - is a glaring omission pertaining to an important issue in the Appellants' claims.\n[25] For their part, the Appellants contend that they never even discussed the issue of Rwandan citizenship with the FC. The FC submits that it was discussed, which is the only reason why the Appellants showed him the AA's certificate of registration as a Kenyan citizen.18 Given that the Appellants all possess Kenyan passports, presenting a certificate of registration would only plausibly occur in the context of a discussion, however brief, regarding the AA's Rwandan origins. On a balance of probabilities, I find that the Appellants did discuss their status in Rwanda with the FC prior to the RPD hearing.\n[26] The issue of the Appellants' status in Rwanda involves the interpretation of Rwandan nationality laws. It is the type of issue that does not necessarily require further preparation by the refugee claimants themselves. Instead, claimants would necessarily rely on their legal representative to address this issue by consulting the relevant portions of the NDP and by advancing legal arguments on their behalf.\n[27] I find that the omissions of the FC constitute negligence as it pertains to the representation of the Appellants on the issue of their status in Rwanda. However, I do not find that the outcome of the RPD proceedings would have been different, but for the FC's negligence. Accordingly, a miscarriage of justice did not result.\n[28] I reach this conclusion for two primary reasons. First, even if it were determined that the Appellants were not Rwandan nationals, their claims would still have been rejected because they failed to establish a forward-facing risk of persecution in Kenya. Second, the Appellants were given ample opportunities at the RPD hearing to elaborate about their fear of returning to Rwanda. Credible and persuasive testimony in that regard would have cured any inadequacy in the legal representation vis-\u00e0-vis their status in Rwanda.\n[29] I realize that the Appellants are also of the view that if the FC had submitted additional documentation that was provided to him before the hearing, the outcome of the RPD hearing would have been different, in that a well-founded fear of persecution in Kenya would have been established. These documents included different lease agreements from the PA's husband, letters from the lawyers of the PA's father, and an affidavit and medical note from the AA's sister.19 However, the FC gave them legal and strategic advice regarding those documents, which the Appellants ultimately accepted. Given the profiles of the adult Appellants and their prior experience in changing representatives, I find that if they were unsatisfied with the FC's advice on April 30, 2021, they had more than a reasonable opportunity to request that the FC modify his strategy, seek a second opinion, attempt to postpone their RPD hearing, secure alternate representation, and\/or represent themselves. Moreover, the Appellants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the FC's assessment of their documentary evidence itself constitutes incompetence.\n[30] In light of the adult Appellants' extensive BOC narratives, it was reasonable for the FC to focus on the most credible evidence directly tied to the Appellants' allegations. The FC's decision-making in this regard was indeed strategic in nature. Reviewing it without the benefit of hindsight, I find that the FC's assessment of the Appellants' documentation did not constitute inadequate representation.\n[31] The adult Appellants had a fulsome opportunity to present cogent oral evidence about their prospective risk of harm at the RPD hearing. They attested to the completeness of their BOC forms and testified that the PA's husband had been harassed by the police after the Appellants' departure. The PA testified that she is not involved in any political activities, nor does she have plans to be politically active in the future. The Panel specifically asked both the PA and AA to describe the basis for their forward-facing fear of persecution.20\n[32] I appreciate that the Appellants feel that they were not adequately prepared by the FC for the RPD hearing, and that they were pressured by the FC to offer less than candid testimony. However, in light of the aforementioned facts, the profiles of the adult Appellants, and the clear instructions contained in the BOC forms, I find that the Appellants had a reasonable opportunity to fully present their case. For the same reasons, I also find that the FC's alleged mid-hearing warning about providing inconsistent testimony did not constitute coercion or undue pressure. Counsel are permitted to advise their clients about the consequences of their testimony; such communications are generally appropriate unless it can be established that the clients were pressured into providing false or misleading testimony. On a balance of probabilities, I find that the conduct of the FC, as alleged, did not meet that threshold.\n[33] Furthermore, I do not find that the questioning by the RPD panel infringed upon the Appellants' right to procedural fairness. Claimants are not entitled to advance notice of the Panel's exact questions. The time spent on a given issue may not align with a claimant's expectations, and may vary based on the nature of the claim, the determinative issues, and the quality of the evidence. After reviewing the conduct of the RPD Member, I have not found sufficient evidence to be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants were unduly interrupted during their testimony or that they were otherwise discouraged or prevented from testifying truthfully, completely, and accurately. For instance, the Appellants provided robust answers to questions about their fear of returning to Rwanda and Kenya.21\n[34] Overall, I am not tasked with deciding whether the Appellants received perfect representation or whether they have an expert knowledge of the law and RPD proceedings. Rather, the question before me is whether, in all of the circumstances, the FC and\/or the RPD effectively inhibited the Appellants from reasonably presenting their entire case. I answer that question almost exclusively in the negative. The FC's negligence was limited to his failure to adequately advance an argument on the Appellants' status in Rwanda, however no miscarriage of justice resulted from that conduct.\n[35] Therefore, I conclude that the requirements of the rules of natural justice were met, in that the Appellants' right to procedural fairness was not materially breached.\nThe remaining new evidence is inadmissible\n[36] The substantive content of the remaining new evidence (see para. 14, supra) arose prior to the RPD hearing. I have not found a material breach of the Appellants' right to procedural fairness. Therefore, there is no reasonable explanation why this documentation could not have been provided prior to the RPD's decision. An appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is not an opportunity to correct a deficient record.\n[37] As a result, none of the remaining new evidence is admissible.\nANALYSIS\n[38] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.22\nRwanda is a valid country of reference\n[39] The RPD found that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellants are all Rwandan nationals.23 After my independent assessment of the evidence, I reach a slightly different conclusion, which ultimately has the same effect; Rwanda is a valid country of reference for all of the Appellants.\n[40] The term \"countries of nationality\" in section 96(a) of the IRPA includes potential countries of nationality. Where citizenship in another country is available, a claimant is expected to make attempts to acquire it. Thus, it is incumbent on a claimant to show, at the time of the hearing, that they have a well-founded fear of persecution (or risk of section 97 harm) in every country where it is within their control to acquire citizenship. In the refugee determination process, those countries are collectively referred to as \"countries of reference\". Therefore, depending on the circumstances, claimants can be construed as nationals of countries that they are not yet legally recognized as citizens of.\n[41] I note that the Appellants testified that they did not make inquiries with Rwandan authorities regarding their status in the country.\n[42] The objective country documentation is helpful in determining how particular nationality laws apply to the facts. This case presents some challenges because Rwandan citizenship law has undergone significant revisions since the nation became independent in 1962.\n[43] The evidence demonstrates that dual nationality is permitted. Any person who has one Rwandan parent is considered Rwandan. Those who were deprived of Rwandan nationality between November 1, 1959 and December 31, 1994 due to an acquired foreign nationality, can re-acquire their Rwandan nationality of origin, without application, upon their return. Moreover, all persons with Rwandan origin and their descendants have the right to acquire Rwandan nationality upon request.24\n[44] Regardless of whether the AA renounced or was deprived of Rwandan citizenship after becoming a Kenyan national, the law allows her to re-acquire her status in Rwanda, through mere formalities. Based on the broad constitutional provisions protecting descendants of holders of Rwandan nationality of origin, both the PA and MFA are clearly eligible for Rwandan citizenship through attribution.25\n[45] The Appellants cite various provisions of the Code de la nationalit\u00e9 rwandaise and assert that the PA is not Rwandan because children of a Rwandan mother and a non-Rwandan father can only claim Rwandan citizenship between the ages of 18 and 21 years old.26 However, those statutory provisions, enacted in 1963, have long been superseded by a nationality framework which takes a decidedly more generous approach to citizenship. For instance, it no longer matters whether a person's Rwandan origins are maternal or paternal.27\n[46] The RPD drew an adverse credibility inference due to inconsistent evidence about the AA's status in Rwanda. The RPD correctly highlighted discrepancies between the BOC, the immigration forms, and the AA's testimony. The AA attributed the error to her first RPD counsel, an explanation which I find is unreasonable given the Appellants' profiles and their unequivocal affirmation at the beginning of the hearing that the BOC forms were accurate. The Appellants take the position that the AA's status in Rwanda has no bearing on the credibility of her story or on her subjective fear of returning to Kenya and Rwanda: as a result, the Panel's finding was illogical.\n[47] I disagree with the Appellants' position. Because of the lack of reasonable explanations for the discrepancies in question, a negative credibility finding is warranted. The RPD did not find that this inconsistency undermined the Appellants' overall credibility. The negative credibility finding does, nevertheless, impugn the trustworthiness of the Appellants' opinion regarding their status in Rwanda. In contrast, the RPD essentially found that the AA's testimony on this issue was unreliable, and so the BOC, by default, should be relied upon in finding that the AA is a citizen of Rwanda.\n[48] My independent assessment takes a slightly different, more nuanced approach. I find that both the Appellants' testimony and their BOC forms fail to credibly establish the Appellants' status in Rwanda. However, the uncontested biographical details in this case (e.g. the origins of each Appellant, and the AA's acquisition of Kenyan citizenship after her marriage) combined with the thorough and pertinent country documentation about nationality in Rwanda's NDP are sufficient to allow me to determine the relevant issue before me: per my analysis, above, Rwanda is a valid country of reference (or country of nationality) for each Appellant.\n[49] At the same time, there is insufficient credible evidence before me that the AA is currently a Rwandan citizen. The RPD was not required to make that precise finding, and it erred by doing so.\nThe Appellants failed to establish a forward-facing risk of harm in Kenya\n[50] The RPD found that the Appellants failed to establish a prospective risk of harm in Rwanda and Kenya. After conducting my independent assessment, I agree with the RPD's conclusion; the Appellants have adduced insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish a well-founded fear of persecution or risk of section 97 harm in Kenya.\n[51] As mentioned above, the PA is no longer politically active in Kenya and has not expressed any desire to be, if returned. The Appellants were threatened in 2017 by persons who wanted her to poison Mr. XXXX, a person who has since successfully obtained refugee protection in Canada. When asked whether she played a publicly visible role in Mr. XXXX's campaign, the PA responded that she mainly just XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.28 Therefore, I disagree with the Appellants' argument that the RPD misconstrued or otherwise downplayed the PA's role in Mr. XXXX's campaign.\n[52] I have no reason to doubt that the events of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX 2017, occurred as alleged. The RPD did not question their occurrence, and thus the RPD did not err by not referencing the supporting documentation. The RPD appropriately focussed its analysis on the Appellants' forward-facing risk.\n[53] The PA testified that her husband has had to relocate multiple times, and has been followed by police officers and unknown individuals who have inquired into the PA's whereabouts. The PA's father was similarly approached in XXXX 2019. When weighing this evidence against the gravity of the threats of 2017 and the continued presence and relative safety of several of the Appellants' close relatives in Kenya, I find that the Appellants failed to present sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk of section 97 harm, if they returned to Kenya.\n[54] Without a forward-facing risk of harm in Kenya, the Appellants do not meet the definition of Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Because this finding is determinative of the present appeals, I need not consider the Appellants' risk of harm in Rwanda.\nCONCLUSION\n[55] I dismiss the appeals and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJoseph W.

The Principal Appellant acts as designated representative for the minor Associate Appellant, XXXX.\n[2] The Appellants are citizens of India. They fear harm in India at the hands of the Punjab and Delhi police, as well as at the hands of certain individuals suspected by police to be involved in criminal activity. The Principal Appellant refers to these individuals as \"smugglers\" or \"militants\". For consistency, these individuals have been referred to as \"smugglers\" throughout these reasons.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellants' refugee claims for the following main reasons:\na. The RPD found that there were inconsistencies and omissions in the Appellants' evidence that raised questions about some of their allegations. It found that the Appellants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Punjab police or the Delhi police are looking for the Principal Appellant;\nb. The RPD found that it was speculative that the smugglers are looking for him in India; and\nc. The RPD found that the Appellants have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bangalore.\n[4] The Appellants have appealed the RPD Decision and asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to grant the appeal and make all other orders judged appropriate.\n[5] On appeal, the Appellants:\na. Attempt to rectify the issues of credibility with explanations and new evidence;\nb. Argue that the police and smugglers have the means and motivation to locate them anywhere in India;\nc. Argue that it is not reasonable for them to relocate to any of the IFA locations; and\nd. Argue that for the benefit of the minor Associate Appellant, the RPD decision should be overturned.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. I find that the RPD correctly concluded that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Mumbai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention1 refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[7] According to the Basis of Claim (BOC) form narrative of the Principal Appellant and the testimony of the adult Appellants before the RPD, the Appellants' fear arose in April 2018 after the Principal Appellant, who owned and operated a taxi service, drove two men from Ludhiana towards Delhi. The taxi was stopped at a police roadblock outside Karnal, Haryana, where the two passengers exited the taxi and ran away, leaving behind two bags containing arms, ammunition and drugs in the taxi. The Appellants allege that the police wrongly accused the Principal Appellant of being involved in a militant and\/or criminal group, having been left responsible for the bags of illegal items in his taxi.\n[8] The Appellants allege that both adult Appellants were detained and tortured by the Punjab police in Ludhiana in relation to these accusations. They were released after the payment of bribes and assurances from the Municipal Councillor in their area and the Principal Appellant's father that they would bring the Appellants to the police upon request. The Appellants stayed with the Principal Appellant's aunt in Delhi and then other locations within Delhi before leaving for Canada in XXXX 2018.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\n[9] According to the law,2 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision;\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[10] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.3\n[11] The Appellants have submitted two pieces of evidence for consideration as new evidence pursuant to section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA):\n* Document A: A three-page affidavit from the father of the Principal Appellant, dated XXXX XXXX, 2021; and\n* Document B: A one-page document containing a picture of the Principal Appellant's work identification card and business card for XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ludhiana.\n[12] I find that a portion of the affidavit from the father of the Principal Appellant constitutes new evidence while other portions do not. I find that the document regarding the Principal Appellant's employment does not constitute new evidence. My reasons are as follows.\nDocument A - accepted in part\n[13] The affidavit of the father post-dates the RPD Decision of July 23, 2021. However, portions of the affidavit pertain to facts that pre-date the RPD Decision, including statements regarding how the Principal Appellant first came to the attention of police, how the father learned of the Principal Appellant's arrest, steps taken to get the Principal Appellant and the adult Associate Appellant released from police custody, the subsequent visits by police to the home of the parents and other relatives, and the fact that the Municipal Councillor took the responsibility to produce the adult Appellants to police as soon as they return to India. Evidence regarding these events was already before the RPD, in the form of testimony from the Principal Appellant.\n[14] I find that the evidence in the affidavit of the Principal Appellant's father regarding these events did not arise after the RPD Hearing, as the Principal Appellant testified to these events himself at the RPD Hearing. I also find that the Appellants have not established that the information from the father was not reasonably available at the time of the decision, or that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected to present the evidence to the RPD before the decision.\n[15] Most of the facts that relate to these events were accepted by the RPD. However, with respect to the evidence that there were visits by police to the home of the parents and other relatives, the RPD found the Principal Appellant's testimony not to be credible. At the hearing, the RPD raised its concern with the fact that the visits from police were not documented in the Appellants' BOC form narrative and stated that the father's evidence regarding police visits was important.4 The RPD noted that the Appellants were able to get statements from other individuals.\n[16] At the conclusion of the hearing, the RPD reserved its decision. The Appellants had five weeks from the conclusion of the RPD Hearing until the decision was rendered, during which time they could have requested the opportunity to submit further evidence but did not do so.\n[17] On appeal, the Appellants state that they are now submitting an affidavit from the Principal Appellant's father \"certifying about the police visits.\"5 However, the Appellants do not explain in their Appellants' Memorandum why this information was not presented to the RPD. A RAD appeal is not a second chance to submit evidence to answer weaknesses identified by the RPD and supplement a deficient record. Refugee claimants are expected to put their best foot forward at the RPD stage.6\n[18] I find that the Appellants reasonably could have requested an affidavit from the Principal Appellant's father before the RPD made its decision on the refugee claims: the Appellants were able to get written statements from other family members; they were in regular telephone contact with the father and had been informed by him of the visits with police; and they were advised of the RPD's position that this was evidence that was important to the RPD's consideration of the refugee claims.\n[19] I find that this portion of the affidavit did not arise after the RPD Decision, was reasonably available and could reasonably have been expected to be presented to the RPD. It does not meet the criteria under section 110(4) of the IRPA to be admitted as new evidence.\n[20] The affidavit of the Principal Appellant's father contains some information for which it is unclear when the events occurred, including the following:\na. The father sometimes receives anonymous phone calls asking about the whereabouts of the Principal Appellant. The phone calls are from unknown numbers and never disclosed to the Principal Appellant.\nb. Whenever there are national day celebrations or police visit their locality, the police enquire about the Principal Appellant's date of return to India.\nc. The police started alleging that the Appellants have joined with terrorists abroad and that they will be arrested whenever they return to India or relocate anywhere in India.\nd. Terrorist activities are increasing in India and whenever there are any incidents, the police enquire about the whereabouts of the Principal Appellant and his date of returning, either with the father or other people in the area. Terrorists attacked Dina Nagar, Pathankot airfield in Punjab and Uri in Jammu and Kashmir.\ne. Since the Principal Appellant has violated police conditions, the police have become more violent now.\n[21] Again, the Appellants do not explain whether this information arose before or after the RPD Decision and why it was not presented to the RPD. In the absence of information regarding when these events occurred or why these specific statements regarding police harassment were not presented before the RPD when other evidence of conversations with the Principal Appellant's father regarding police harassment was presented, I find that the Appellants have not established that this evidence arose after the RPD Decision, was not reasonably available at the time of the decision, or that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected to present the evidence to the RPD before the decision. This portion of the affidavit does not meet the criteria under section 110(4) of the IRPA to be admitted as new evidence.\n[22] The affidavit does refer to some events or evidence that arose after the RPD Hearing, including the following:\na. On XXXX XXXX, 2021, a new police inspector came and alleged the police received information that the Principal Appellant had returned to India to disrupt Republic Day celebrations. The father told police that the Appellants are residing in Montreal, Canada and have no plans to return to India.\nb. The inspector slapped the father and pushed around the mother. He was aggressive and threatened to circulate the name of the Appellants to all police headquarters such that they will not be able to relocate anywhere in India.\n[23] I find that these particular statements in the affidavit meet the criteria of new evidence under section 110(4) of the IRPA, as they relate to events that occurred on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, which is after the date of the RPD Decision.\n[24] I have gone on to consider the credibility, relevance, and newness of the evidence, as required by the case law.7 The evidence is new in that it arose after the RPD Decision. The evidence is relevant to the issue of whether the police in Punjab have an ongoing interest in the Appellants. The evidence appears to be credible in that there are no internal inconsistencies, concerns regarding the genuineness of the document, or other circumstances that lead me to doubt its credibility. This portion of the affidavit is accepted as new evidence.\nDocument B - rejected\n[25] I find that the evidence regarding the Principal Appellant's work at XXXX XXXX does not meet the criteria for acceptance as new evidence in this appeal. The Appellants do not indicate clearly in their Appellants' Memorandum how this evidence meets section 110(4) of the IRPA or how this evidence is new, relevant, or credible. They state that when filing their refugee claims, they communicated through an interpreter and the interpreter did not indicate on their background declaration form the complete information regarding the Principal Appellant's employment in India, only mentioning that the Principal Appellant had owned a business. While the RPD had questioned the Principal Appellant on the evidence regarding his employment in India, it did not draw any negative conclusions about his employment in its decision. When assessing the reasonableness of the IFA locations, it accepted that the Principal Appellant had been employed as a collections manager at a finance company before starting his own taxi business in India.\n[26] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the evidence of the Principal Appellant's employment at XXXX XXXX existed prior to the RPD Decision considering that he worked there prior to coming to Canada. I find that the Appellants have not established that the evidence was not reasonably available or that they could not reasonably have been expected to provide the evidence before the RPD Decision. I find this evidence does not meet the criteria under section 110(4) of the IRPA to be admitted as new evidence.\nNo oral hearing required\n[27] The Appellants do not request an oral hearing. A portion of the proposed new evidence has been accepted; however, I find the criteria to hold an oral hearing pursuant to section 110(6) of the IRPA has not been met. As will be explained in my analysis below, the information in Document A that has been accepted as new evidence would not justify allowing the appeals, as I find that the Appellants have viable IFAs even in light of the new evidence. As such, no oral hearing is required.\nANALYSIS\n[28] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.8\nScope of the appeal\n[29] I find that the determinative issue in this appeal is whether the Appellants have a viable IFA. In addition to a finding of IFA, the RPD also made a negative credibility finding regarding the allegation that the police in Punjab have continued to visit the family home of the Principal Appellant, inquiring about his whereabouts, and indicating that they suspect him to be involved in militant activities.\n[30] I find that it is not necessary to review the RPD's credibility finding or the arguments by the Appellants regarding the credibility finding by the RPD. For the purposes of the IFA analysis, I have assumed without deciding that the Appellants' evidence is credible and that the events occurred as alleged, including that there has been continued inquiries by police in Ludhiana in the whereabouts and activities of the Principal Appellant. I have also accepted as credible the new evidence submitted on appeal that there has been a recent visit by police to the home of the Principal Appellant's family, inquiring about his whereabouts and accusing him of being involved in militant activities.\n[31] I find that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Mumbai, Kolkata and Bangalore. While the RPD also made a finding that there is a viable IFA in New Delhi, I have not considered New Delhi as an IFA location. I find that it is not necessary to review the RPD's findings regarding New Delhi as an IFA location, as there are viable IFAs in three other cities.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[32] The RPD correctly identified the two-pronged test for assessing an IFA:9\n(1) The Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) The conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n[33] Both prongs of the test must be satisfied to find that a claimant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and potential IFAs identified, the burden of proof rests with the claimant to show that they do not have an IFA.\nThe first prong - No serious possibility of persecution or likelihood to be harmed in Mumbai, Kolkata or Bangalore\n[34] I find that the Appellants have not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they face a risk to their lives, a danger of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment (collectively, section 97 harm) in Mumbai, Kolkata or Bangalore.\nRisk at the hands of the Punjab police\n[35] I find that the Appellants have not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they face section 97 harm at the hands of the Punjab police if they relocate to Mumbai, Kolkata, or Bangalore.\n[36] The Appellants allege that they are at risk because police in Punjab suspect the Principal Appellant of being involved with the individuals who left arms, ammunition and drugs in his taxi and that they therefore suspect him of being a terrorist, militant, or criminal. The Appellants allege that if the Principal Appellant is not found by the police, the Associate Appellants are at risk of persecution or harm from police in his stead, as was the case when the police arrested and tortured the adult Associate Appellant in XXXX 2018 when they could not locate the Principal Appellant at the family's residence.\n[37] The RPD found that, even if it accepted that the police have visited the Principal Appellant's family looking for him, it appears that the motivation of the police is not necessarily to find the Principal Appellant but rather to extort money from his family. It found that this appears to be the actions of some corrupt police officers in Ludhiana, rather than the Punjab police force as a whole.\n[38] On appeal, the Appellants argue that the police have the means and motivation to pursue them in the proposed IFA locations. They concede that when the Principal Appellant was apprehended with the two bags of objectionable items, there was no other proof and hence no legal charge was levied. However, they argue that \"the police wanted a scapegoat to be presented in greed of prizes.\"10 The Appellants quote evidence from the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India, which states that illegal detentions are quite common in India and that sections of the Indian Penal Code regarding the arrest and detention procedures are often not honoured. They argue that the Principal Appellant does not have an official charge or warrant against him but that the police or security agencies can detain him anytime without following the protocols and that \"even if a person is not officially wanted by the police (as there is no legal case against him) but the police need him for their own purpose, there is high possibility of him being apprehended as the \"wanted database also works according to the daily police dairy [sic].\"11\n[39] I find that the RPD was correct to conclude that the treatment experienced by the Appellants at the hands of the police, and the ongoing threats and harassment of the Principal Appellant's family by police, are a result of the corrupt actions of police officials in Ludhiana who are motivated by greed rather than a genuine interest in pursuing a criminal investigation against the Principal Appellant. The Appellants concede that the Principal Appellant is not facing terrorism charges and that the Punjab police have been motivated by greed. The documentary evidence in the NDP indicates that corruption is widespread in India and officials frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.12 The evidence indicates that significant human rights issues included unlawful and arbitrary killings, torture, and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by some police, and a lack of trained police officers.13 The evidence indicates that police fail to file required arrest reports for detained persons and use torture as a means to extort money or as summary punishment.14\n[40] I find that, in the particular circumstances of the Appellants, the risk they face is limited to Punjab state and that there is not a serious possibility of forward-looking risk of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk of section 97 harm in Mumbai, Kolkata or Bangalore. The police in India fall under state jurisdiction.15 The activities and interests of the police in one state do not necessarily extend to other states within India.\n[41] I have considered the new evidence on appeal that a new police inspector visited the family of the Principal Appellant in Ludhiana in XXXX 2021 and threatened to circulate information regarding the Appellants to all police headquarters such that they will not be able to relocate anywhere in India. I find that this threat is insufficient to establish that there is a serious possibility of persecution to the Appellants in the proposed IFA locations. Accepting as credible that the police inspector made this threat to the Principal Appellant's father, I do not find that there is a serious possibility that the threat will be acted upon. According to the Appellants, the police in Ludhiana has been harassing the Principal Appellant's family and requesting bribes for the past three years. Throughout this time the police have not opened an official investigation into the Principal Appellant. The allegations by the Ludhiana police inspector that the Appellants are involved in recent militant activities within India are clearly without foundation, as they have been in Canada since 2018. Given that the Principal Appellant is not the subject of an official investigation, warrant, or charge, and given my findings that the police in Punjab were, on a balance of probabilities, pursuing the family for extortion rather than a legitimate investigation, I find that there is not a serious possibility that the Punjab police would pursue the Appellants outside their area of jurisdiction in Punjab or that the police in any of the proposed IFA locations would have any interest in the Appellants. I find that any risk of future illegal detention in any of the IFA locations is speculative.\n[42] While the Appellants argue that there are some resources for state law enforcement to coordinate with other states regarding individuals identified as criminals, I find that the Appellants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that their prior arrests or detention were documented by the Punjab police in any database or diary entry that would be accessible through inter-state criminal information systems such as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS) or in any other police database that would bring them to the attention of authorities in the proposed IFA locations or that would allow the Punjab police to locate them outside that state.\n[43] Documentary evidence regarding CCTNS states that it is intended to be used to input all First Incident Reports (FIRs), which serve as the first official record of a criminal complaint and serves to activate a police investigation.16 As noted by the Appellants in their Appellants' Memorandum, other documentary evidence indicates that daily diary or general diary accounts and other forms are also recorded in CCTNS.17 However, the documentary evidence also indicates that no official record of extra-judicial arrests is maintained in official criminal databases, including CCTNS.18\n[44] In this case, the Principal Appellant testified that the police in Punjab arrested and detained him after his taxi was stopped at the police roadblock in Haryana. The Principal Appellant testified that the police did not file any complaint or charge against him and only threatened to do so.19 His evidence is that he was not brought before a court or magistrate.20 The Appellants' evidence is that the adult Associate Appellant was detained as a proxy when the Punjab police later could not locate the Principal Appellant. The evidence does not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that an FIR or any other record of the Appellants' detentions were documented by police or input into a database.\n[45] Citing evidence from the NDP, the Appellants argue on appeal that concerned officers can seek information through normal official channels. This evidence does not assist the Appellants, as they have not established that there is a serious possibility that the Punjab police or the police in the proposed IFA locations would seek out information regarding the Appellants.\n[46] Even in the event that the Appellants are required to undergo tenant verification or other background checks to settle in the IFA locations, the evidence in the NDP indicates that the tenant verification process involves a search of databases include the CCTNS for records of registered cases or charges.21 While the evidence in the NDP indicates that the police do not follow through with all verifications once filed,22 even if a local police force in the IFA locations did process a tenant verification or other background check regarding the Appellants, there is not a serious possibility that it would uncover a record of their past interaction with the Punjab police.\n[47] I conclude that the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk of section 97 harm at the hands of Punjab police or local police in the IFA locations, if they return to India and relocate to Mumbai, Kolkata, or Bangalore.\nRisk at the hands of the Delhi police\n[48] In their BOC form narratives, the Appellants do not allege any risk at the hands of the Delhi police. However, at the RPD Hearing, the Principal Appellant stated that he fears the Delhi police.23 He testified that he approached the Delhi police seeking their protection due to the threats and mistreatment from the Punjab police. He testified that rather than provide the Appellants with protection, he believes the Delhi police informed the Punjab police of their presence in Delhi, as the Punjab police attended their home in Ludhiana the following day looking for the Appellants. The Principal Appellant also testified that the Delhi police searched for the Principal Appellant at his aunt's home in Delhi on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\n[49] Accepting as credible that the Delhi police searched for the Principal Appellant in 2018, even where the RPD found this not to be credible, I find that there is not a serious possibility of forward-looking persecution at the hands of the Delhi police in the IFA locations. The Appellants do not allege, and the evidence does not establish, that there have been any inquiries by the Delhi police into the whereabouts of the Appellants in the past three years. The XXXX 2019 affidavit of the Appellant's aunt, who continues to live in Delhi and who accompanied the Principal Appellant to request the Delhi police's protection, does not indicate that there have been any subsequent visits by police to her home or inquiries with her regarding the whereabouts of the Appellants. The Appellants are not accused of any crimes for which the Delhi police have jurisdiction. The Appellants do not allege, on appeal, that there is an ongoing risk to them at the hands of the Delhi police. I find that the Appellants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of the Delhi police or that, on a balance of probabilities, they face a risk of section 97 harm at the hands of the Delhi police in Mumbai, Kolkata or Bangalore.\nRisk at the hands of the smugglers\n[50] The Appellants allege that they are at risk of persecution or harm at the hands of the individuals who left the bags of arms, ammunition, and drugs in the taxi of the Principal Appellant. The Principal Appellant testified that he believes the smugglers are looking for him and will want to harm or kill him.24 When asked how he knew that the smugglers are looking for him, he stated, \"I do not have any information but it's the fear in my mind.\"25\n[51] The RPD found that it was speculative that the smugglers are looking for the Principal Appellant in the IFA locations. It considered that the Principal Appellant remained in Delhi for many months without being contacted by the smugglers. It considered that the Principal Appellant did not have any knowledge that the smugglers were looking for him, only that it was a fear that he had.\n[52] On appeal, the Appellants argue that the RPD was incorrect in its finding that the risk to the Appellants at the hands of the smugglers is speculative. In response to the RPD's concern that the Principal Appellant was able to stay in Delhi for several months without getting approached by the smugglers, they argue that it can only be speculated as to whether the smugglers had a base in Delhi or were using Delhi as a transit point. They also argue that the smugglers have the motivation to seek the Principal Appellant as the Principal Appellant had seen them firsthand and could be used by the police to apprehend them at any point in time, or because they are looking for their bags. The Appellants also point to the evidence in the Principal Appellant's father's affidavit that he has received anonymous phone calls asking the whereabouts of the Appellants.\n[53] I find that the RPD was correct to conclude that the risk at the hands of the smugglers is speculative. It has been established that, during the time that the Principal Appellant was in Delhi after the incident, he had no contact with the smugglers. It is speculative that the smugglers are interested in the Appellants at all three years later, whether because they would be looking for their bags or because of a concern that the Principal Appellant would identify them to police. The evidence that the Principal Appellant's father has received anonymous phone calls, which was rejected as new evidence, does not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the phone calls are coming from the smugglers. I find that the Appellants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of the smugglers or that, on a balance of probabilities, they face a risk of section 97 harm at the hands of the smugglers in Mumbai, Kolkata or Bangalore.\nThe second prong - Relocation to Mumbai, Kolkata or Bangalore is not objectively unreasonable\n[54] The RPD found that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata or Bangalore. The RPD noted that, although the Appellants argued that without money they would not be able to survive, they did not articulate why they could not earn money. The RPD considered that the Appellants are highly educated with bachelor's degrees, the Principal Appellant has work experience in India as a XXXX XXXX at a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX at a XXXX XXXX, and operated his XXXX XXXX business, and the adult Associate Appellant has work experience as a XXXX XXXX in India. Both have further work experience in Canada. Both adult Appellants speak Hindi, Punjabi and English. The RPD concluded that the Appellants were well positioned to find employment in the proposed IFAs and earn income to provide for their family.\n[55] On appeal, the Appellants argue that relocation to any of the proposed IFA locations is not reasonable for the following reasons:\na. The Principal Appellant would be required to undergo a background check as a mandatory procedure for any job in the organized sector, which would reveal their location;\nb. For the Principal Appellant to start a XXXX business again, he would have to apply for a loan, which involves a background check, which would reveal their location;\nc. It would be next to impossible to build a reputation in a new place; and\nd. It would be impossible for the Appellants to establish a good level job or business in India, in order to live a decent life like they have been used to.\n[56] The Federal Court of Appeal in Thirunavukkarasu held that a claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling to or in staying in an IFA location; however, it is not enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there.26\n[57] I find that the RPD was correct to conclude that it is not objectively unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to Mumbai, Kolkata, or Bangalore. I have already concluded that the Appellants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that they face any formal charges or that their detentions by the Punjab police were documented in any databases or systems accessible by police in other states. I find that there is a not a serious possibility that applying for a job or a loan will trigger a concern by police in the IFA locations or trigger notification to the Punjab police if a query is conducted through CCTNS. Furthermore, while it may take time and effort for the Appellants to achieve the lifestyle to which they have become accustom either in Punjab or in Canada, the threshold for assessing the reasonableness of an IFA location is whether it would jeopardize the lives and safety of the Appellants. I find that the Appellants have not established that their lives or safety would be jeopardized in the IFA locations. The adult Appellants both have university educations, work experience in various fields, and speak Hindi, Punjabi, and English. I agree with the finding of the RPD that they are well positioned to find employment in the proposed IFAs and earn income to provide for their family.\n[58] I note that the Appellants argue that, for the benefit of the minor Associate Appellant, the appeal should be allowed. The Appellants do not make any specific arguments as to any risk faced by their child in India or any reason why she could not relocate with the Appellants to any of the IFA locations. I find that the Appellants have not established a basis for the appeal to be granted in respect of the minor Associate Appellant.\n[59] I have also considered that the adult Appellants allege that they were tortured by Punjab police and that the adult Associate Appellant alleges that she was tortured and sexually assaulted by Punjab police. However, I have already found that there is not a serious possibility that the Punjab police will pursue the Appellants in the IFA. The Appellants have not raised any additional arguments before the RPD or on appeal regarding the impact of their experiences in detention on the reasonableness of relocating within India.\nConclusion on Internal Flight Alternative\n[60] Having conducted an independent assessment of the evidence, I conclude that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Mumbai, Kolkata and Bangalore. They do not face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mumbai, Kolkata or Bangalore. It would not be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances for the Appellants to live in any of these locations.\nCONCLUSION\n[61] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nLaura Ko\nLaura Ko\nJanuary 10, 2022\nDate\n1 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, subsection 110(4).\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant), his wife, XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellant), and their minor son, XXXX XXXX (Minor Appellant), collectively referred to as the Appellants, are citizens of India. They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their claim for refugee protection. The Principal Appellant acted as the designated representative for the Minor Appellant.\n[2] The Appellants allege a fear of harm at the hands of the Associate Appellant's uncles and the police if they were to return to India. The Appellants believe that the agents of harm intend to assassinate them in an honour killing.\n[3] In a July 27, 2021 RPD Decision, the RPD rejected the claim, finding that the Appellants have a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) within India in Chennai and Bengaluru (IFA Locations).\n[4] On appeal, the Appellants argue that the RPD committed a substantive error in its appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence adduced during the hearing.1\n[5] I disagree with the Appellants. I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants have a viable IFA within India in the IFA Locations.\n[6] The recent Alazar2 decision requires the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to provide notice to the Minister of new issues on appeal under certain circumstances even if the Minister has not intervened in an appeal. On December 14, 2021, I provided a notice to the Minister and the Appellants that I will be considering new issues, namely, forward-looking risk and state protection (Notice). I received the Appellants' Response Memorandum on December 24, 2021. I did not receive a response from the Minister.\nDECISION\n[7] The appeal is dismissed, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).3 The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention4 refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS\n[8] The following is a summary of the Appellants' allegations contained in their Basis of Claim (BOC) form narratives and oral testimonies.\n[9] The Principal Appellant and the Associate Appellant married in January 2012. They allege that it was a love marriage to which their respective families did not consent. After their marriage, they fled their village of Bussowal in Punjab and lived in a friend's house in Mota Singh Nagar for one and a half years.\n[10] In XXXX 2013, the Principal Appellant and the Associate Appellant returned to Bussowal after their friend negotiated their return with the Principal Appellant's family, the village sarpanch and the police. The police reassured the Principal Appellant and the Associate Appellant that the Associate Appellant's uncles would not bother them.\n[11] The Associate Appellant's uncles, who have connections with the Congress party, conspired with the police to take the Principal Appellant and the Associate Appellant to the police station four times to compel them to divorce.\n[12] Shortly after the birth of the Minor Appellant, the Associate Appellant's uncles threatened to kill the Appellants. In April 2017, after the Congress party assumed power in Punjab, the police questioned the Principal Appellant at his workplace, asking the whereabouts of a co-worker, who was a XXXX, and threatening to kill the Principal Appellant if he did not produce his co-worker. The police told the Principal Appellant that the Associate Appellant's uncles felt socially humiliated. The Appellants allege that they thus understood that the police were searching for a way to arrest and kill them.\nADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE SUBMITTED ON APPEAL\n[13] The Appellants submit the following as new evidence for this appeal:\n1) Affidavit of XXXX XXXX XXXX sworn on December 13, 2021, together with his Identification Card and a notary public certification5;\n2) Affidavit of XXXX XXXX, sworn on December 13, 2021, together with his Identification Card6; and\n3) A Daily Punjab Times news article dated December 15, 2021, with an English translation.7\n[14] The above documents were submitted in response to the Notice. Therefore, I only need to consider whether these documents meet the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA8 and the Raza\/Singh9 factors.\nDocuments in 1), 2) and 3) admitted\n[15] I find that the documents listed in 1), 2) and 3) meet one of the legislative factors set out in section 110(4) of the IRPA as these documents relate to new information that arose after the rejection of the Appellants' claim.\n[16] Further, I find that these documents meet all the Raza\/Singh factors. These documents appear credible on their face, and I have no reason to doubt the source and circumstances in which they came about. They are relevant to the issues of (1) whether the Appellants face a forward-looking risk of harm from the Associate Appellant's uncles and the police and (2) whether the Associate Appellant's uncles and the police are motivated to locate and harm the Appellants. They are new in the sense that they relate to new information that arose after the rejection of the Appellants' claim. For these reasons, I admit the documents listed in 1), 2) and 3) as new evidence for this appeal.\nREQUEST FOR AN ORAL HEARING\n[17] I note that the Appellants did not request an oral hearing. I have nonetheless considered the necessity of holding an oral hearing. Under section 110(6) of the IRPA,10 the RAD may hold a hearing if there is new evidence that raises a serious issue with respect to the appellant's credibility, which is central to the decision in the claim and, if accepted, would justify accepting or rejecting the claim. In this case, I find that the new evidence does not meet the criteria to hold a hearing. I further find that there is sufficient evidence on record to arrive at a decision. Accordingly, it is not necessary for me to hold a hearing.\nISSUES ON APPEAL\n[18] I have considered the Appellants' arguments and evidence relating to the new issues of forward-looking risk and state protection. However, based on my independent assessment, and having considered all the evidence, I find that the determinative issue on appeal is whether the Appellants have a viable IFA within India in the IFA Locations. Accordingly, I have addressed the Appellants' arguments and new evidence to the extent that they relate to the issue of IFA.\n[19] The Appellants argue that the RPD committed a substantive error in its appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence adduced during the hearing.11\nANALYSIS\n[20] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.12\n[21] I have conducted an independent assessment of all the evidence, including the Appellants' Record in its entirety and the oral testimony.\nThe Appellants are generally credible\n[22] The RPD found that the Appellants testified in a spontaneous manner, and their testimonies were generally coherent with the allegations contained in their BOC forms. In addition, the RPD found the Appellants to be generally credible witnesses, who have established all their allegations on a balance of probabilities.13 I agree with and confirm the RPD's finding for the same reasons provided by the RPD.\nThe determinative issue on appeal is IFA\n[23] The Appellants argue that the RPD committed a substantive error in its appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence adduced during the hearing.14 As the determinative issue in the RPD Decision is IFA, I understand the Appellants' argument to be that the RPD committed a substantive error in its determination that the Appellants have a viable IFA within India in the IFA Locations.\n[24] I disagree with the Appellants. The RPD raised the issue of an IFA at the outset and proposed the IFA Locations. I find that the RPD did not err in its appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence and in finding that the Appellants have a viable IFA within India in the IFA Locations. My reasons follow.\n[25] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA for the Appellants is two-pronged. For the first prong of the IFA analysis, I must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility that the Appellants would be persecuted on a Convention ground and that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellants would not be personally subjected to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA location. For the second prong, I must be satisfied that it is not objectively unreasonable for the Appellants, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, to relocate to the IFA location.15\n[26] Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have an IFA. Once the issue of an IFA has been raised and the potential IFA locations have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellants to show that they do not have an IFA. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option.16\nFirst prong of IFA analysis: The RPD correctly concluded that the Appellants would be safe from their agents of persecution in the IFA Locations\nThe Appellants have not demonstrated that the agents of persecution have the motivation and the means to locate them in the IFA Locations\nMotivation of the agents of persecution\n[27] The Appellants submit that the Associate Appellant's family has all the motivation to persecute the Appellants as the Principal Appellant and the Associate Appellant married each other against the wishes of the Associate Appellant's family and, as a result, the family's social and political reputation has been tarnished.17\n[28] I am not persuaded by the Appellants' arguments. Based on my independent assessment, and having considered all the evidence, I find that the Appellants have not established that the Associate Appellant's family has the motivation to locate and harm the Appellants if they were to return to India and relocate to the IFA Locations.\n[29] I agree with the RPD that for several years, the Appellants lived in a location known to the agents of persecution and the Appellants have been harassed by the local police and have received threats. Nevertheless, the situation never escalated beyond verbal intimidation, in a context where the agents of persecution are described as enjoying the complicity with the police.18\n[30] The evidence demonstrates that from July 2013 to December 2017, the Associate Appellant's uncles, despite having a clear influence on the local police, failed to take any action against the Appellants beyond verbal intimidation aimed to compel the Principal Appellant to divorce the Associate Appellant, notwithstanding the uncles' knowledge of the Appellants' location in the village of Bussowal. Accordingly, I am unable to find that the Associate Appellant's uncles are motivated to act beyond verbal intimidation to locate and harm the Appellants if they were to return to India and relocate to the IFA Locations.\n[31] The Appellants further submit that the conduct of the police in accusing the Principal Appellant of being an accomplice of one of his co-workers who is believed to be an anti-national demonstrates the motivation of the agents of persecution to harm the Appellants.19\n[32] I disagree with the Appellants. I acknowledge the Principal Appellant's evidence that in April 2017, at the behest of the Associate Appellant's uncles, the police questioned the Principal Appellant at his workplace, asking the whereabouts of a co-worker, who was a XXXX, and threatening to kill the Principal Appellant if he did not produce his co-worker. The police also told the Principal Appellant that the Associate Appellant's uncles felt socially humiliated.\n[33] At the hearing, the Principal Appellant testified that the April 2017 incident was linked to the Associate Appellant's uncle who likely caused the Principal Appellant's co-worker to \"run away to make a platform in order to inculcate me in some charge.\" I find that the Principal Appellant's evidence on the April 2017 incident may have supported a reasonable inference that the agents of persecution were motivated to act beyond verbal intimidation and attempt to fabricate criminal charges against the Principal Appellant in 2017. However, given the passage of over four years with no criminal charges having been filed against the Principal Appellant, I am unable to find that the Associate Appellant's uncles are motivated to act beyond verbal intimidation to locate and harm the Appellants if they were to return to India and relocate to the IFA Locations.\n[34] The Appellants have provided new evidence to demonstrate the recent attempts by the Associate Appellant's uncles and their agents to locate the Appellants.\n[35] In his affidavit sworn on December 13, 2021, Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX the Principal Appellant's father, states that he has been receiving threats to his life from the Associate Appellant's family. Mr. XXXX further states that on November 13, 2021, he was physically and mentally abused in his home by the Associate Appellant's uncle, his son, and their goons, who were searching for the Principal Appellant and the Associate Appellant and who fired gun shots in the air.20 This incident is corroborated by Mr. XXXX XXXX affidavit sworn on December 13, 2021.21\n[36] The affidavits are signed, dated, and are accompanied by identification cards with photographs. The deponents also appear to have personal knowledge of the incidents described in the affidavits. However, I find that the information in the affidavits is vague and unclear and do not support a reasonable inference that the Associate Appellant's uncles are motivated to act beyond verbal intimidation to locate and harm the Appellants if they were to return to India and relocate to the IFA Locations. Accordingly, I attribute low weight to these affidavits.\n[37] With respect to the Daily Punjab Times news article dated December 15, 2021,22 I note that it does not have an author, is published two days after the affidavits are sworn, and almost a month and two days after the November 13, 2021 incident. Moreover, the article states that the police have failed to nab the culprits who are unidentified armed men, which is inconsistent with the affidavits which identify the culprits as the uncle, his son, and some goons. Further, the timing of the publication is fortuitous, as it was published the day after the Notice was sent to Counsel for the Appellants. Lastly, the article is not accompanied by a declaration of a translator that the translation is accurate as required by Rule 28(3) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules.23 Accordingly, I also attribute low weight to this news article.\nMeans of the agents of persecution\n[38] The Appellants submit that the police have all the means to persecute the Appellants, especially the Principal Appellant, who is a person of interest to the police.24 Further, the Appellants submit that the Principal Appellant does not have an official charge under the Indian Penal Code or warrant against him, but the police or security agencies can detain him anytime without following the protocols.25\n[39] I acknowledge the Appellants' submissions regarding the means available to the police to locate the Appellants through the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) database, the tenant verification procedures, and mandatory background checks.26 However, having considered the relevant objective documentary evidence, I find that the effectiveness of these systems is limited in nature to enable the police to track and locate the Appellants across state lines to the IFA Locations, specifically the Principal Appellant, given his particular profile.\n[40] The objective documentary evidence indicates the lack of effective interstate police communication in India, except in cases of serious or major crimes. I refer to the Response to Information Request (RIR) which indicates that there is \"little inter-state police communication except for cases of major crimes like smuggling, terrorism, and some high profile organized crime.\" Moreover, \"police stations across India are virtually unconnected islands in the case of crime and criminal tracking. There is no system of effective data storage... sharing and accessing data and there is no 'single system' by which a police unit can 'talk to another directly.'\"27\n[41] In addition, sources note that the CCTNS database has been deployed over a large part of India that \"includes information on crime and criminals that interconnects police stations across the country.\"28 However, that report also states that \"[p]olice stations in India still work in silos as far as criminal information is concerned\" and that a large part of the CCTNS is not yet implemented and has yet to become functional across the country.29\n[42] Having considered the objective documentary evidence, I find that the Principal Appellant's profile is not sufficient to motivate the police to share information with counterparts in different states. The Principal Appellant has not provided evidence that he has been charged with an offense or is subject to a warrant for his arrest and, therefore, does not have the profile of a person who committed a crime that would enable the police to use the CCTNS database to track and locate the Appellants across state lines to the IFA Locations.\n[43] With respect to tenant verification, the objective documentary evidence indicates that although the CCTNS is supposed to assist the verification process and is accessible in almost all police stations in India, police forces are ill-equipped and short-staffed to actually carry out such verifications.30\n[44] Additionally, I agree with the RPD that there is no evidence to support a finding that the agents of persecution would have the influence to use the state apparatus against the Appellants in another region of India.31 I also agree with the RPD that while the agents of persecution do have influence on a local police force, there is no evidence to support a finding that the agents of persecution have enough influence to bribe a remote police corps into fabricating charges and imprisoning the claimants, something that the local police did not manage to do.32\n[45] In summary, based on my independent assessment and having considered all the evidence, I find that the Appellants have not established that the Associate Appellant's uncles and the police have the motivation and the means to track and locate the Appellants across state lines to the IFA Locations. Accordingly, I find that the RPD was correct in concluding, on the first prong of the IFA analysis, that the Appellants would be safe from their agents of persecution in the IFA Locations, on a balance of probabilities.\nSecond prong of IFA analysis: The RPD correctly concluded that the Appellants have not established that relocation to the IFA Locations would be objectively unreasonable in their circumstances\n[46] For the second prong of the IFA analysis, the Appellants must demonstrate that the conditions in the IFA are such that it would be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, for them to seek refuge there. The central question is whether expecting the individual to relocate to the proposed IFA location would be \"unduly harsh.\"33 The courts have set a very high threshold for the unreasonableness prong of the test in that \"it requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant.\"34\nThe Appellants' personal circumstances do not make the conditions in the IFA Locations objectively unreasonable\n[47] The Appellants submit that it is not reasonable for them to relocate to the IFA Locations. Firstly, the Principal Appellant is not highly educated to be hired as a XXXX at some organized sector in the IFA Locations. Secondly, if the Principal Appellant decides to be hired by the unorganised sector, language will be a big barrier as the Appellants do not possess even the basic knowledge of Tamil (for Chennai) or Kannada (for Bengaluru). Lastly, starting a new business is also not possible because of the need for finances from financial institutions which will require a background check.35\n[48] I am not persuaded by the Appellants' arguments. Although the Principal Appellant may not be highly educated, he has nonetheless worked as a XXXX XXXX for ten years. He was also self-employed running his own XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX before he left India in XXXX 2017. Further, there is no evidence that the Principal Appellant would face a language barrier in the IFA Locations. The objective documentary evidence indicates that while the official language of Chennai is Tamil, the following languages are also spoken: English, Telugu and Malayalam.36 Moreover, the languages spoken in Bengaluru include the following: Kannada, Hindi, English, Telugu, Urdu, Tamil, Konkani and Malayalam.37 The Principal Appellant speaks English, one of the languages spoken in the IFA Locations and would, therefore, not face any language barrier to seeking employment in the IFA Locations. Lastly, I find that if the Principal Appellant decides to start a new business in the IFA Locations, the requirement for a background check to obtain finances from a financial institution does not make it objectively unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate there.\n[49] The RPD noted that the IFA Locations are in economically dynamic regions of India. Bengaluru is a \"demographically diverse city\", \"the fastest growing metropolis in India\", and \"a major economic and cultural hub.\" Chennai has \"a diverse array of economic sectors and is known for its automotive industry.\" I agree with the RPD that given that the IFA Locations have a thriving economy, the Appellants would, on a balance of probabilities, manage to find employment in the IFA Locations.38 Moreover, considering the Principal Appellant's significant work experience and transferable skills, I find that he would be well placed to find employment and support himself and his family financially in the IFA Locations.\n[50] In summary, I find that the Appellants have not adduced sufficient evidence of actual and concrete conditions in the IFA Locations that would jeopardize their lives and safety.\n[51] I acknowledge the Principal Appellant's concern that he will not get a job in the IFA Locations.39 However, I find that the Principal Appellant's concern is reflective of the hardship associated with dislocation or relocation and is not the kind of undue hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable. I further note that the jurisprudence is clear that it must be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to live in the IFA, in that it is insufficient for the Appellants to demonstrate mere subjective reluctance to relocate there.40\n[52] Considering all of the foregoing, I find that the Appellants have not demonstrated that the IFA Locations would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh in their particular circumstances. Accordingly, I find that the Appellants have a viable IFA within India in the IFA Locations.\nCONCLUSION\n[53] The appeal is dismissed. I confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nLiza Guevara\nLiza Guevara\nJanuary 19, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit P-2, Appellants' Record, Appellants' Memorandum, at p. 8, para. 1 [Memorandum].\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Appellant alleges that, if he returns to Angola, he would be killed by his former boss who, at the time, was a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. During the eight-year period before he left Angola, the Appellant worked as a XXXX XXXX in two different private companies owned by his former boss. He alleged that he was employed in \"slave-like\" conditions because he was required to travel a lot and neither he nor his co-workers dared to complain or express an opinion that differed from that of their former boss. The Appellant's frequent work-related travel had negative effects on his family life. In June 2018, the Appellant submitted his resignation in order to save his marriage. He alleges that his former boss took it as a sign of disrespect and that he was very upset with him. One of the Appellant's friends subsequently informed him that he needed to leave immediately because his former boss had ordered a search for him. The Appellant, his spouse, and his children left Angola for Brazil in XXXX 2018. His wife and children stayed in Brazil and sought asylum there, whereas the Appellant used his American visa to travel to the United States and cross the border into Canada to claim refugee protection.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the Appellant was excluded from protection under Article 1E of the refugee Convention due to his permanent resident status in Brazil. In rendering its decision, the RPD balanced all of the factors set out in the Supreme Court of Canada's Zeng decision1 which must be applied in cases, such as the present, in which an appellant held permanent resident status in another country but let it lapse by the time of the RPD hearing.\nDECISION\n[4] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 I disagree with the arguments made by the Appellant's counsel for why she believes the RPD erred in this case. The RPD was correct to conclude that the Appellant is excluded from refugee protection by the combined effect of Article 1E of the refugee Convention and section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nANALYSIS\nArticle 1E legal framework and uncontested issues\n[5] The Supreme Court of Canada set out the framework of analysis for the application of Article 1E as follows:\nConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.3 [emphasis added]\n[6] The Appellant admits that he had permanent resident status in Brazil before he left that country. He also does not contest the RPD's finding that this status granted him substantially all of the same rights and obligations as nationals of Brazil. Counsel also appears to recognize that the applicable analysis is that set out in the third prong the Zeng decision in which a decision-maker is called upon to consider and balance the factors set out in the quote from Zeng set out above.\nLoss of permanent resident status does not rule out exclusion\n[7] Notwithstanding Counsel's recognition that the applicable test is that set out in the Zeng decision, she argues that it would be contrary to Canada's international obligations to find the Appellant excluded from protection because he had lost his permanent resident status in Brazil by the time of the RPD hearing. Clearly, such an argument cannot be accepted, as the Supreme Court itself made clear in the Zeng decision that individuals may be found to be excluded from refugee protection even in situations where they have lost their status in the country of residence. The reason for this is to avoid asylum shopping by claimants who are entitled to status in a safe third country. The fact that an individual has lost their permanent resident status by the time of the RPD does not, by itself, rule out the application of the Article 1E exclusion. Instead, in such cases, a decision-maker is called upon to consider and weigh the various factors mandated by the Supreme Court in Zeng, which is what the RPD did in this case.\n[8] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) case cited by Counsel in the appeal memorandum is distinguishable. In that case, the RAD did not rule out the application of the Article 1E exclusion simply because the appellant had lost his status in the Article 1E country by the time of the RPD hearing. Instead, the RAD found that it would be contrary to Canada's international obligations to find the appellant excluded from protection because he had lost his permanent resident status in Brazil and he would face a threat to his life if he returned to Haiti.4 By contrast, I agree with the RPD's conclusion, in this case, that the evidence did not establish a serious possibility that the Appellant would face a forward-looking risk of persecution in Angola. Therefore, I do not agree with Counsel that the decision supports her argument that the Appellant's loss of permanent resident status ruled out the application of the Article 1E exclusion.\nNo error in consideration and weighing of Zeng factors\nNo dispute that the Appellant likely could not regain his permanent resident status\n[9] There is no dispute that the Appellant had likely lost his permanent resident status in Brazil by the time of the RPD hearing. At the hearing, the Appellant testified that he believed that he had lost his permanent resident status because, in his view, it was linked to his previous employment. I agree with the RPD that there was no evidence, beyond the Appellant's personal belief, that this was in fact the case.\n[10] However, the RPD was correct to find that the Appellant had likely lost his permanent resident status as a result of being outside Brazil for more than two years by the time of the RPD hearing. As found by the RPD, this factor weighs against finding him excluded from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention.\nNo error in finding departure from Brazil voluntary\n[11] Counsel argues that the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant's departure from Brazil was voluntary because, according to Counsel, the Appellant's life is at risk in Brazil. I do not agree that there is sufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility that the Appellant would be persecuted or a likelihood that he would be subjected to serious harm in Brazil.\n[12] As noted by Counsel, the Appellant testified that he believed his life would be in danger in Brazil because his former boss had numerous family members and friends in that country. He testified that his former boss had the same influence over people in Brazil as he did in Angola and that he would be able to harm him anywhere in Brazil. While the Appellant testified that his family moved to a different town because they did not feel safe in the initial town where they had lived, the Appellant admitted that no one had approached his wife and children in Brazil for any reason let alone to harm them. However, he argued that they did not feel safe in Brazil. The RPD correctly found that the appellant's subjective belief of being at risk in Brazil was not sufficient to objectively establish that he was indeed at risk in that country. In addition, it correctly found that the fact that no one had caused any problems for the Appellant's wife or children, or even approached them to determine the Appellant's whereabouts, suggested that the Appellant similarly would not be at risk in Brazil.\n[13] The only argument made by Counsel on appeal is that, since the RPD did not question the Appellant's credibility, it should have accepted his testimony about believing that he was at risk in Brazil. I do not agree. This argument by Counsel confuses two distinct concepts, that of credibility, on the one hand, and the sufficiency of evidence, on the other. An Appellant may credibly subjectively believe that they are at risk in either their country of residence or their home country, but their belief may be purely speculative and unsupported by the evidence. In such a case, there may be insufficient evidence to support the Appellant's subjective belief that they are at risk. That is the case here. Even if I were to accept that the Appellant subjectively believes that he would be at risk all over Brazil, there was insufficient evidence to support this belief.\n[14] In this case, although the Appellant made a broad assertion that his former boss had as much influence in Brazil as he did in Angola, he did not provide the RPD with any evidence that could establish that he held such power in Brazil. Meanwhile, the only evidence he gave in his testimony about his former boss's power and influence was that his former boss is has many friends and family members in Brazil. As noted by the RPD, the Appellant never received any threats whatsoever by his former boss or his family or friends while he was in Brazil. Likewise, neither his spouse nor children, all of whom remain in Brazil and have claimed asylum there, have had any problems whatsoever from the Appellant's former boss or members of his family or friends.\n[15] Based on all of the above, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant failed to establish that he was at risk in Brazil. Therefore, the RPD correctly held that his departure from Brazil was voluntary. This factor militated in favour of his exclusion from refugee protection.\nNo error in finding no forward-looking risk in Angola\n[16] I do not agree with Counsel that the RPD erred in finding that the evidence did not establish that the Appellant would face a forward-looking risk in Angola.\n[17] Counsel argues that the RPD should have found that the Appellant had established that he faces a forward-looking risk in Angola because the RPD stated that it was inclined to find him credible with respect to the events that he alleged occurred before he left Angola. As already noted above, even in cases where the RPD finds an appellant credible about the events to which they testify, it may nevertheless find that they have provided insufficient evidence to prove the risk that they allege or, as in this case, to prove a forward-looking risk if they were to return to their country today. Where a claimant provides indirect or circumstantial evidence of the risk they allege, a decision-maker must rely on inferences, and weigh each piece of evidence to decide whether the cumulative weight of all of the evidence is sufficient to establish the fact or risk being alleged.5\n[18] The Appellant testified that he fears returning to Angola because he fears his former boss would seek to kill him for quitting his employment for his boss's two private companies. He also testified that, after he left Angola, the new president began to prosecute members of the former government, including the Appellant's former boss. The Appellant alleged that his former boss would kill him to prevent him from disclosing information he had on illegal monetary transfers made by him. He also claimed that his former boss would come after him due to his membership in the UNITE party. Finally, he also added that he feared being persecuted by the current President's administration due to his connections to his former boss.\n[19] I do not agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred in concluding that the Appellant's former boss no longer had influence in Angola in the absence of proof to this effect. The onus of proof in this case lies with the Appellant, not the RPD. It was the Appellant, not the RPD, who had the onus of proving, the level of influence maintained by the Appellant's former boss today despite the fact that he is no longer a General, has no role in the government, and that he is currently being prosecuted by the present government in Angola.\n[20] In my view, the RPD correctly found that the Appellant's fear of future harm at the hands of his former boss was based on speculation. He provided no evidence that the members of the former Dos Santos government have been targeting civilians who might have knowledge of the internal workings of the former government to prevent them from disclosing any information to the current government and prosecutors. Moreover, as the RPD noted, the Appellant could only provide very vague evidence about damaging information he would have against his former boss that he would be in a position to disclose to those prosecuting him. In fact, at the hearing, the Appellant admitted that he did not know whether any damaging information he would be in a position to disclose may have already come to light or have already been disclosed by other sources.6\n[21] The RPD did not err in requiring evidence to corroborate the Appellant's allegations regarding any forward-looking risk he would face in Angola. While corroborating evidence is generally not required, the Federal Court has made clear that such corroborating evidence may be required in certain circumstances. One such circumstance is when a large portion of the claim is based on hearsay.7 That is precisely the case here, as the Appellant's allegation that his former boss was searching for him when he quit in 2018 was based on information passed along to him by his friend who was one of his former boss's security guards.\n[22] The only corroborating evidence that the Appellant submitted was a written statement signed by the above-mentioned friend. The Appellant testified that his friend told him that his former boss took his quitting as a sign of disrespect and that he had ordered a search for him.8 The portion of the friend's declaration in which he states his knowledge of the situation is all of one sentence long. The Appellant's friend states that, on June 2, 2018, he was present during the search and apprehension of the Appellant under the orders of his former employer, \"due to a misunderstanding regarding the contract between the employer and the employee.\" [translation]9 I note that it is unclear what the friend means by the search and apprehension of the Appellant, as the Appellant was never in fact apprehended. In any event, at most, the declaration establishes that the former boss had ordered some kind of search for the Appellant in 2018 due to a dispute over his employment contract. I agree with the RPD that, even accepting the content of the declaration as true, it is insufficient to establish a serious possibility that, if he were to return to Angola, the Appellant would be persecuted, killed, or seriously harmed by his former boss. This is especially the case since, as the RPD noted, the Appellant's former boss no longer occupies a position of authority and he is presently embroiled in a corruption scandal.\n[23] I do not agree with Counsel that the RPD incorrectly relied upon what the friend's declaration does not say rather than what it does say. In fact, the RPD relied upon what the declaration actually says, which is little. The RPD found that even accepting the contents of the declaration as true, it was insufficient, on its own, to establish a serious possibility that the Appellant's former boss would persecute or harm him if he were to return to Angola today. I also do not agree with Counsel's argument that the RPD breached procedural fairness by not putting its concerns about the document to the Appellant to ask for his explanations. The RPD was not required to do so as, even accepting the contents of the document to be true, the document was insufficient to establish that the Appellant would face a forward-looking risk at the hands of his former boss.\n[24] I do agree with Counsel that the RPD erred in placing additional reliance on the fact that the Appellant's former boss had not contacted his brothers and sisters in Angola to ask about his whereabouts. The Appellant had in fact testified that he had not been in touch with his brothers and sisters for two years, even if he was still in touch with his mother. Therefore, he arguably would not have been in a position to know whether his former boss had contacted his brothers and sisters to ask about him. In my view, this error by the RPD does not taint the rest of the RPD's analysis, all of which was otherwise correct for the reasons given above.\n[25] Finally, I do not agree with Counsel that the RPD erred in finding that it was purely speculative for the Appellant to assert that his former boss would persecute him if he returned to Angola today due to the Appellant's membership in UNITA. On some level, I agree with Counsel that the RPD seemed to be suggesting that the Appellant should have been able to present some form of corroborating evidence to support his claim that his former boss knew he was a UNITA member and that he would target him for that reason. As I see it, the problem was not with the lack of corroborating evidence on this point, it was with the Appellant's own testimony which failed to support his assertion that his former employer would seek him out to persecute him because of his UNITA membership.\n[26] The Appellant himself testified that he never told his former boss that he was a member of UNITA. While he did testify that, at some point, his former boss told him that he knew about his UNITA membership, it was unclear when his boss became aware of this membership. There was no evidence that the Appellant's former boss ever mistreating him because of this membership during the course of his employment. In fact, the Appellant testified that he and his former boss were very close and that his former boss considered him like a son, which was one reason why his former boss took his quitting as a sign of disrespect.10 Moreover, the Appellant was clear in his testimony that he feared that his former boss would come after him because of this perceived disrespect and also because of whatever information the Appellant might be in a position to disclose about his illegal money transactions. In all the circumstances, I find that the RPD was correct to find that the Appellant's allegation that his former boss would come after him to kill or seriously harm him due to his membership in UNITA was speculative and that he failed to make out a serious possibility that this would occur.\n[27] In light of the above, the RPD was correct to find that the Appellant had not established that he faced a serious possibility of persecution or a likelihood of serious harm at the hands of his former boss. The RPD did not address the allegation added by the Appellant at the hearing that he feared that the current President of Angola would persecute him due to his association to his former boss, nor did Counsel make any arguments with respect to this allegation on appeal. In my view, there was no evidence, other than the Appellant's speculation, to support his claim at the hearing that he might be persecuted by the current President and his administration due to his employment in his former boss's companies. Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellant would face a serious possibility of persecution or a likelihood of serious harm at the hands of the current President or anyone else in Angola.\n[28] For the above reasons, the RPD correctly found that the Appellant failed to establish a serious possibility that he would be at risk if he returned to Angola today. Therefore, the RPD correctly held that this factor weighed in favour of exclusion.\nNo error in analysis of Canada's international legal obligations\n[29] The Appellant does not specifically contest the RPD's analysis of the final factor from the Zeng test: the factor relating to Canada's international legal obligations. As in most cases, the RPD's analysis of this factor was based on its analysis of the others set out above. The RPD was correct to find that there were no international obligations incumbent upon Canada nor any other relevant factors that would justify not excluding the Appellant under Article1E of the Convention. This was the case given the fact that the Appellant's departure from Brazil was voluntary and he failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or a likelihood of serious harm if he returned to Angola today.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] For the above reasons, I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJo-Anne Pickel\nJo-Anne Pickel\nJanuary 13, 2022\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Appellant submits that the RPD erred and demonstrated bias.\n[3] The Appellant presents new evidence under section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and Rule 29 and requests a hearing under section 110(6). I have not accepted any of the new evidence and reject the request for a hearing.\n[4] Following my own review, I find that the Appellant did not establish his allegation of bias and the RPD correctly found that that he was not credible with respect to material elements of his claim.\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nNone of the new evidence presented by the Appellant is accepted\n[6] The Appellant's claim was heard on July 15, 2021, and the RPD gave its decision on August 17, 2021. The Appellant presented new evidence with the perfection of his appeal on November 1, 2021. On March 18, 2022, the Appellant made an application pursuant to Rule 29 of the RAD Rules to submit additional new evidence.\nEvidence presented with the perfection of the appeal\n[7] Section 110(4) of the IRPA provides that an appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. In Singh,1 the Federal Court of Appeal dictates a narrow interpretation of section 110(4): the conditions set out therein must be met, and there is no room for discretion on the part of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). If the section 110(4) threshold is met, then the new evidence must also meet jurisprudential requirements of credibility, relevance and newness.2\n[8] The Appellant submits his brother's RPD decision, list of exhibits and extract of the evidence3 as new evidence with his appeal, specifically the following documents:\nA.

Arundhati Roy, India: Intimations of an Ending, November 22, 2019.12\n[9] Document A, G and I are not new evidence as they were presented to the RPD and form part of the RPD record.13\n[10] The RAD Rules14 state that the Appellant's memorandum must include full and detailed submissions regarding how any new evidence meets the requirements of section 110(4) and how that evidence relates to the Appellant.\n[11] Documents B-H all predate the RPD decision and, in fact, predate the RPD hearing so they do not, on their face, meet the temporal requirements of section 110(4). The Appellant acknowledges that all of the new evidence is dated before the decision, but he submits that he couldn't be expected to file his brother's whole case. \"The brother's evidence and his decision were possibly available before the decision, but it is not reasonable to expect the appellant to have filed all this evidence before, he has a very strong case. It is only reasonable to permit someone like the appellant to submit evidence from those who are close to him that can contradict the conclusions of the tribunal.\"15\n[12] Section 110(4) is not to be used to complete a deficient record submitted before the RPD.16 I note that the Appellant presented equivalent evidence sworn on a later date to the RPD:\nNew evidence\nRPD record\nC.

I am not satisfied that the Appellant has reasonably explained why he did not present the new evidence at his hearing or before the rejection of the claim. Even if I were satisfied with his explanation, I find that documents B-F and H are not relevant or new because, as detailed above, equivalent, newer evidence was presented by the Appellant to the RPD. The Appellant does not reference any of the new evidence in his appeal submissions other than his submissions relating to the new evidence.27\n[14] For all these reasons the new evidence is not admissible.\nRule 29 application\n[15] There is a different test for the submission of new evidence under Rule 29. In deciding whether to admit new evidence under Rule 29, I must first consider any relevant factors including: (a) the document's relevance and probative value; (b) any new evidence the document brings to the appeal; and (c) whether the person who is the subject of the appeal, with reasonable effort, could have provided the document or written submissions with the appellant's record, respondent's record or reply record.28 If the evidence addresses all the Rule 29 factors, I must then determine whether it meets the subsection 110(4) legislative and jurisprudential requirements.\n[16] The Appellants submitted the following new evidence on March 18, 2022:\nJ. Affidavit of the Appellant's father, XXXX XXXX sworn XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022;29\nK. Medical Report from XXXX Hospital dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022;30\nL. Affidavit of XXXX XXXX, Sarpanch, sworn XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022;31\nM. Letter from XXXX XXXX, XXXX BSP Punjab dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022;32\nN. XXXX XXXX on Appellant by XXXX XXXX, Ph. D. dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022;33\nO. Posters of the Appellant's father who XXXX XXXX XXXX for candidates for the Assembly;34\nP. Picture of the Appellant's father as a XXXX XXXX from XXXX 2022;35\nQ. Picture of visit from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of BSP Punjab, to the Appellant's father on his birthday.36\n[17] The Appellant submits \"that all this evidence is new and relevant to the issues that must be addressed in the appeal and that none of this was available before her [sic] hearing\" and that the Rule 29 and section 110(4) criteria \"is clearly respected with these documents.\"37\n[18] I do not find that the photographs, posters and messages included in documents O, P or Q are translated or sufficiently labelled to verify that they meet the temporal requirements of section 110(4) or Rule 29 and they are not, therefore, admissible as new evidence.\n[19] While they meet the temporal requirements, I find that there are inconsistencies, contradictions and omissions in documents J, K, L, and M which lead me to find that they do not, on a balance of probabilities, meet the credibility criterion of section 110(4).\n[20] In document J, the affidavit of the Appellant's father, he recounts three attacks:\n* XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 - he was beaten unconscious by four men on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, thrown on the road and was taken to a hospital by \"some unknown person\" where a doctor \"informed at my home.\"\n* XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022 - he and his wife were beaten by \"a group of some covered persons\" and were saved by \"some persons from village\" and they were brought to hospital.\n* XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022 - the police came to his home \"late evening\" and took him to the police station when he was tortured and abused, he was released the next day with the help of the Village Council.\n[21] Document K, the medical report does not confirm that the Appellant's father arrived at the hospital unconscious on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, or that he arrived with his injured wife on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022. Most problematic, the medical report says that the Appellant's father was brought to the hospital on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022, when his affidavit says he was not released from police custody until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022.\n[22] Document L, the affidavit of the Sarpanch does not reference any dates and only one attack saying that the Appellant's father \"was attacked by the unknown goons and... illegally detained by the Police with false accusation...I helped in his release.\" The Sarpanch does not make any reference to the attack on the Appellant's mother.\n[23] Document M, the BSP letter, does not provide any details about the attacks on the Appellant's father only saying, \"in the current Assembly Election for 2022, him and his wife were targeted, beaten and tortured by goons as well as of the Police.\" This letter does not reference to the earlier attack on the Appellant's father and says that his mother was also detained by the police.\n[24] I also note that documents J, K, L and M are all written in English, presented on unilingual English letterhead, stamped with unilingual English stamps and have no reference to any translations while the Appellant only speaks Punjabi38 and English is not an official language in Punjab.39\n[25] With respect to document N, the Appellant submits that he is producing a XXXX report, \"after he was brought to see a XXXX because of severe XXXXandXXXX XXXX after the RPD decision.\"40 The Appellant argues that this did not exist before the appeal and that his XXXX condition is \"very relevant to the appeal.\"41 The Appellant also submits that he did \"not know of his XXXX problems before the hearing.\"42\n[26] The Appellant's submissions are not entirely consistent with his BOC narrative which said that he was tortured \"affecting my state of mind...I am not able to re-collect many incidents and events.\"43 When the RPD asked the Appellant \"do you have any XXXX report or something with respect to this?\" he answered, \"Yes, I have it\"44 referring to a medical certificate from a hospital in India which said that when he was brought to the hospital by his father in XXXX 2019 and was \"in XXXX and in apprehension condition.\"45 When the RPD asked the Appellant if he had a XXXX report or treatment in Canada, he said no and that he did not have enough money.46\n[27] It is arguable that, in this context, the Appellant could reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented a XXXX report to the RPD. This is reinforced by the Appellant's submission that he could have been declared a vulnerable person before the hearing \"but this was given no importance in the final decision in his case.\"\n[28] I note that there is no reference in the RPD record to an application to designate the Appellant a vulnerable person or seek a designated representative. The Appellant's counsel did not seek any accommodations at the RPD hearing or make any submissions to the RPD about the Appellant's XXXX condition. In fact, the Appellant's counsel told the RPD that the Appellant was \"a very sincere and credible speaker.\"47 The Appellant does not make any appeal submissions about how his XXXX problems affected the RPD's credibility finding.\n[29] Following my own review of document N, I noted one reference to the Appellant's ability to testify:48\nIn relation to his ability to testify, in a low stress situation such as the clinical\ninterviews, XXXX XXXX XXXX has been able to provide details about his past ordeal. In high stress situations, however and, particularly, under the pressure of the immigration hearing when his fear to return to India was highly reactivated, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX may have created transient difficulties in readily responding to questions and\/or in readily providing exact dates which may have impinged on the credibility of his testimony. He stated that he experiences severe XXXX at the time when he is required to talk about his detention and torture.\n[30] Given that most of the RPD's credibility findings were founded on issues with the Appellant's documentary evidence and not just his testimony, I find that new document N is neither relevant nor able to refute the RPD's finding regarding the Appellant's credibility49 and is not, therefore admissible as new evidence.\nORAL HEARING AT THE RAD\n[31] The Appellant requests a hearing pursuant to section 110(6) of the IRPA which says the RAD may only hold a hearing if there is new (section 110(4)) evidence that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellant, is central to the RPD's decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. As I did not accept the new evidence, I must deny the Appellant's application for a hearing.\nSCOPE OF THE RAD REVIEW\n[32] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in assessing and weighing the oral testimony heard, which in particular cases attracts deference.50 Unless specifically stated below, I have applied the correctness standard.\nANALYSIS\n[33] The determinative issue is credibility. The RPD identified credibility issues relating to the Appellant's knowledge of Dalits and the BSP and his role in the BSP and found that the Appellant did not have a reasonable explanation for inconsistencies between his testimony and his Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative about when he was beaten and arrested. The RPD found that a physician's letter and affidavits from his parents failed to corroborate important allegations.\n[34] The Appellant submits that there is not much rational justification for the RPD's finding that he lacks credibility. The Appellant also argues that the RPD was biased and its decision offends Article 3 of the Convention against Torture and does not respect international law.\nAnalysis of credibility in refugee claims\n[35] The process of determining whether a claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under the IRPA requires the RPD to decide whether they believe the claimant's evidence and how much weight to give that evidence. In determining this the RPD must assess the credibility of the claimant and the documentary evidence.51 The law \"imposes a duty upon RPD members to assess the credibility of refugee claimants.\"52\n[36] The Federal Court53 has laid out the relevant principles in analyzing credibility in the context of refugee claims:\n* Refugee applicants are presumed to tell the truth, but this is a presumption rebuttable by the applicant's lack of credibility, e.g. where the evidence is inconsistent with sworn testimony or where the applicant's explanation for the inconsistencies is not satisfactory;\n* Even though they may be insufficient when taken individually or in isolation, the accumulation of contradictions, inconsistencies and omissions regarding crucial elements of a refugee claim can support a negative conclusion about an applicant's credibility;\n* A negative credibility finding cannot be based on minor contradictions that are secondary or peripheral to the refugee protection claim;\n* A lack of credibility concerning central elements of a refugee protection claim can extend and trickle down to other elements of the claim and be generalized to all of the documentary evidence presented to corroborate a version of the facts;\n* Credibility findings should not be made based strictly on the absence of corroborative evidence. Where corroborative evidence should reasonably be available to establish an essential element of a claim and there is no reasonable explanation for its absence, a decision maker can draw a negative inference of credibility based on the claimant's lack of effort to obtain such corroborative evidence; and\n* Conclusions can be drawn concerning an applicant's credibility based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality.\n[37] I have reviewed the evidence on the record, including the transcript of the hearing on July 15, 2021, and the Appellant's arguments. As detailed below I find that the Appellant did not demonstrate bias and while RPD made some errors, they were not determinative, because the accumulation of contradictions, omissions and inconsistencies regarding the Appellant's evidence about crucial elements of his claim support a negative conclusion about his credibility.\nKnowledge of history of Dalits and BSP\n[38] The RPD made a negative credibility finding about the knowledge of the Appellant's history of Dalits and the BSP, the location of the BSP headquarters and whether the party has a youth wing. The RPD references objective evidence54 as authority for the location of the BSP headquarters in Uttar Pradesh and that it does not have a youth wing.\n[39] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of his knowledge of the BSP and in the location of its headquarters. I agree and find that the objective evidence cited by the RPD does not support his finding that the BSP headquarters are located in Delhi. I do not find that this error is determinative given the accumulation of contradictions, omissions and inconsistencies about material elements of the Appellant's claim as detailed below.\nBSP role\n[40] In his BOC narrative the Appellant says that he was made XXXX of the BSP of his village unit in XXXX 2017.55 The letter of support from the BSP said that he was appointed as XXXX of Village Unit of the party in XXXX 2017.56 The affidavits of his father57 and mother58 say that he was elected as XXXX and the affidavits of the Numberdar59 and the Panchayat60 say that he was selected.\n[41] The RPD asked the Appellant about his role as XXXX of the village branch of the BSP:61\nRPD\nAppellant\nAnd what was your role in the party, sir?\nMy role was that whenever an MLA had to come before that, before that I would go to 45 different villages and collect the people along with my associates.\nBut did you have any official appointment, official role, something?\nYes, I was the leader in the village.\nWhat do you mean by leader?\nBecause I would collect, I would collect the youth from the village and take them. So I was the leader of those people. ...Before the leader would come we would collect the people. Then the leader would come and give his speech.\nAnd who was the leader?\nXXXX XXXX XXXX (ph).\nAnd with respect to this what was your role in the party?\nMy role was to collect the youth because I was also young and all the youth who associate with me and join me.\nDoes the party have a youth wing?\nYes.\nI'm asking this, sir, because, you know, Basis of Claim Form you stated that you were XXXX of the party - of the, of the local branch of the party. However, today you testified that your role was more to just to gather people and by singing and after that letting the person, the leader give his speech. So can you explain why you mentioned that you're XXXX?\nThe XXXX is called the leader in English. In the village he's called the leader.\nOkay, I understand, but you said that you sang and after that when people gathered the leader would come, but the leader was not you. So even XXXX means a leader. I don't see your role 20 as a leader neither in those events.\nI was from the village; he was from the district.\n[42] The RPD found that the role described by the Appellant does not correspond to that of a XXXX XXXX XXXX but resembles more the role of a person who advertises the party, and also due to the fact that he did not have a membership card, the RPD made an adverse inference about the Appellant's credibility as being a leader of the village branch of BSP. The Appellant does not make any submissions about this credibility finding.\n[43] I also note that the corroborative evidence is inconsistent with the Appellant's testimony that he was a youth leader rather than village XXXX as all the corroborative documents reference his title as XXXX of the Village Unit. The corroborative evidence is also inconsistent as to whether the Appellant was appointed, elected or selected to be XXXX. These findings are not determinative as they were not put to the Appellant for explanation but they do support the RPD's negative credibility finding.\nInconsistent evidence about hiding in 2018\n[44] The Appellant gave the following evidence about hiding in 2018:\nBOC narrative\nTestimony\nSchedule A62\nFather\nFriend\nJalandhar\nAfter [XXXX 2018] ...I lived at my friend's place in XXXX... I came back home in the month of XXXX 2018.63\nAppellant stayed in Jalandhar from XXXX to XXXX 2018.64\nFrom 2019-XXXX to 2019-XXXX the Appellant lived in hiding in XXXX XXXX XXXX\nAppellant lived underground most of the time and remained in XXXX and returned home XXXX 2018.65\nAppellant lived with me and left my house sometime in XXXX 2018.66\nDubai\nNo reference\nAppellant went to Dubai from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after that went back home.67\nFrom 2018-XXXX to 2018-XXXX the Appellant lived in an unknown hotel in Dubai\nNo reference\nNo reference\n[45] The RPD asked the Appellant to explain the inconsistencies:\nRPD\nAppellant\nHow do you explain that your visit to Dubai was not included in your BOC?\nI have not written it, but I had only gone for a week...and probably forgot the time when I had returned. I've forgotten some things that I have not written.68\nI have one more question because today you testified that you return to your home in XXXX 2018, but, however, in your Basis of Claim Form you stated that you returned to your home in XXXX 2018. Can you explain this difference?\nBecause he had - because my brother had danger previously that was the reason why I had gone out of my home.\nNo, but my question is why did you state in your Basis of Claim Form that your return was in XXXX 2018, but today you testified that it was in XXXX 2018 after your return from Dubai?\nAfter that when I came in XXXX of 2018 I was, I was coming home often from Dubai. I straightaway came home after doing my regular work with my friend.\nBut why did you stated [sic] that you came back home in XXXX 2018 in your Basis of Claim narrative?\nThat I had come there before Dubai, then I had gone there for the first time.69\n[46] The RPD rejected the Appellant's explanation for the omission of reference to Dubai in his BOC narrative because he was represented by counsel, had ample time to review and correct his narrative and was given the opportunity to do so at the outset of the hearing. The Appellant was asked if the information in the BOC was complete, true and correct and he said yes.70 The RPD found that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant is not credible with respect to his allegations that he went into hiding between XXXXandXXXX XXXX 2018.\n[47] The Appellant submits that the RPD's findings are unfounded. He argues that he was clear on the period that he was in hiding and he clarified the small difference on whether he returned home in XXXXor XXXX 2018 at the hearing. The Appellant submits that \"[t]he wild conclusions about his 5 days in Dubai speak much more to the [RPD]'s biased attitude than to any serious contradiction.\"71\n[48] I do not agree, as detailed above, I find that the Appellant's evidence is inconsistent on its face and his explanation does not address the inconsistencies. I note that none of the BOC narrative and the affidavits of the Appellant's father and friend reference the trip to Dubai. As the inconsistencies and omissions are not reasonably explained, this is a determinative negative credibility finding.\nInconsistent evidence about beatings and arrests\n[49] The Appellant gave the following evidence about alleged beatings and arrests:\nBOC narrative72\nTestimony\n2018\nNo reference\nAppellant was beaten for the first time in 2018 but does not remember the date73\nXXXX\/XXXX 2019\nNo reference\nAppellant beaten after speaking against \"them\" in second protest74\nXXXX 2019\nNo reference\nAppellant arrested and electrocuted coming back from a rally75, spend five days in hospital76, this was the one and only police arrest\nXXXX 2019\nAppellant was threatened and beaten on or about XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.\nAppellant was arrested on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, electrocuted and beaten\nXXXX 2019\nAppellant spoke at a rally after which he was arrested, tortured and badly beaten\nAppellant was not in the condition to give any speeches after XXXX 2019 arrest77\n[50] When the RPD asked the Appellant why the 2018 beating was not mentioned in his BOC narrative, he said that there were things that he did not remember because he was under a lot of stress at the time when he applied for refugee protection.78 When the RPD asked the Appellant to explain the inconsistencies between this BOC and testimony, the Appellant said, \"they would take me many times. They would beat me many times\"79 and reiterated that he did not remember some of the things.80 The RPD rejected the Appellant's explanations and found that he provided contradictory testimony and tried to adjust his answers. The RPD concluded that because of his inconsistent testimony about when he was threatened, beaten and arrested that he failed to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he had been threatened and beaten by supporters of the other parties or arrested, detained and tortured by the police.\n[51] The Appellant admits that \"there was contradiction on when he was beaten and tortured in XXXXor XXXX 2018, but we do not believe that his contradiction should be fatal to his credibility.\" The Appellant continues that \"there is very strong documentary evidence in support of every point in his claim. In reality, the analysis of credibility is really off bas [sic] and it does not all reflect the quality of the testimony or the evidence in front of the RPD.\"81\n[52] It is not clear whether the Appellant is making submissions about the alleged beating in 2018 which was omitted from his BOC narrative or his contradictory evidence about the alleged arrests, beating and torture in XXXX, XXXXand XXXX 2019.\n[53] I find that the Appellant's evidence about his beatings and arrests is contradictory on its face and his testimony evolved when he was asked for an explanation. The RPD did not err when it made a determinative negative credibility finding.\nOther negative credibility findings\n[54] The RPD made other negative credibility findings. The Appellant testified that after his detention at the police station in XXXX 2019 he went to the hospital where he stayed for treatment for five days82, but the physician's letter he presented did not mention his treatment and stay in the hospital in XXXX 2019 but does mention treatments in XXXXand XXXX 2019.83 The XXXX 2019 arrest was not mentioned in the Appellant's parents' affidavits but the arrests in XXXXand XXXX 2019 were referenced.84 The Appellant does not make any submissions about these findings.\n[55] I find that the accumulation of contradictions, omissions and inconsistencies regarding the Appellant's evidence about crucial elements of his claim support a negative conclusion about his credibility.\nAllegation of bias\n[56] The RPD made a similar statement, changing the reference to a contradiction, omission or inconsistency, eight times in its reasons:85\nThe Panel rejects the explanation with regards to the contradiction because the claimant was represented by a counsel and because he has had ample time to review and correct his narrative, if necessary. At the outset, the Panel asked the claimant if the information found in the BOC was complete, true and correct. The Panel gave him the opportunity to correct errors or make changes to his BOC narrative, by asking him the question explicitly.\n[57] The Appellant submits that the RPD's repeated use of the statement \"shows a fairly biased frame of mind on the part of the decision-maker.\"\n[58] An allegation of bias is serious, it must meet a very high threshold and be supported by material evidence as explained by the Federal Court:86\nIt should be recognized that counsel are Officers of the Court. Allegations of bias against a Member of the RPD, or any administrative quasi-judicial or judicial decision-maker should only be advanced in the clearest of cases. These circumstances do not exist in this matter. Counsel should be guided by the Federal Court of Appeal's admonition in Arthur v Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 223 (CanLII), at para 8, as follows:\n[8]... An allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard...\"\n[59] I find that the Appellant has not demonstrated that the RPD's repeated use of a similar statement in its reasons is material evidence of bias which demonstrated conduct that derogates from acceptable standards of conduct amounting to a breach of natural justice or procedural fairness.\nCONCLUSION\n[60] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Susan Brown\"\nSusan Brown\nMay 30, 2022\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

If he returns to the West Bank, he claims to fear physical harm from relatives and community members who view him as an apostate following his conversion to the Roman Catholic faith. He further claims that he cannot return to the UAE since being laid off from his job, as he has lost the related sponsorship required to live there.\n* Impugned Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Decision\n[3] The RPD found that the Appellant had credibly established all material elements as claimed and that a serious possibility of persecution did exist if he returned to the West Bank on account of his religious beliefs. However, it found that only the UAE should be assessed as the Appellant's country of former habitual residence because \"Palestine is not recognized as a country by the Canadian authorities.\" The RPD considered that though the Appellant could no longer return to the UAE, he had not alleged any fear of being persecuted there and, hence, that his claim failed.1\n* Grounds for Appeal\n[4] These RPD conclusions are contested on appeal. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in identifying only the UAE as the country against which protection should be assessed. It is argued that while Palestine is not recognized as a State, Canada does recognize the Palestinian Authority as the government of the OPT. Further, this Board in its section on \"Country of Origin\" information has an entry for the OPT which includes a National Documentation Package (NDP). It is submitted that there were sufficient elements in the NDP to establish the well-foundedness of the Appellant's fear.2\n* Determinative Issues\n[5] The determinative issues in this appeal relate to the Appellant's countries of former habitual residence and his forward-looking risk of persecution in either the OPT or the UAE if he returned.\nBACKGROUND\n[6] The undisputed evidence, which was accepted by the RPD, is as follows:\n[7] The Appellant was born in the city of Nablus, in the West Bank to two stateless Palestinian parents who originate from the town of XXXX XXXX close to Nablus.3 He holds a travel document from the Palestinian Authority4 as well as a temporary travel document issued by Jordanian authorities5 which does not grant any right to residence or nationality in Jordan.6 7\n[8] The Appellant resided in and around Nablus for most of his life, in the area currently known as Zone A - under the control of the Palestinian Authority. He then moved for work as an XXXX XXXX to the city of Dubai, in the UAE from 2008 until XXXX 2019.\n[9] While in the UAE the Appellant became interested in, and converted to, the Roman Catholic faith after being introduced to Christianity by Egyptian Coptic and Lebanese Roman Catholic friends who were living there.\n[10] In 2017, while the Appellant was in the United States (US) for five months to pursue an educational opportunity, his brother found out about his new faith and assaulted him. His brother further cut off his financial support to the Appellant, forcing him to leave the US and return to his previous job in the UAE. He thus returned to the UAE, to his previous employer but was put on notice, in XXXX 2018, that his employment would be terminated due to cuts. He left the UAE in XXXX 2019, after having obtained a US visa and made his way to Canada to seek asylum shortly thereafter.\n[11] He now fears returning to the OPT owing to his family members' view of him as an apostate and ensuing risk of harm in the form of physical violence from them and other community members who were made aware of this, as shown by the documentary evidence tendered.8 He further cannot return to the UAE since being laid off from his job given that he has lost the related sponsorship required to live there.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n* Refugee Appeal Division Role\n[12] The role of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is to intervene when the RPD is wrong in law, in fact, or in fact and law. I reviewed the decision of the RPD by applying the correctness standard.9\n* No New Evidence Has Been Tendered\n[13] The Appellant states in his memorandum that he wishes to submit the NDP relating to the OPT as new evidence with his appeal, however, I note that this specific NDP already formed part of the RPD record and is listed as Exhibit 3 in the RPD's Consolidated List of Documents.10 Further, in accordance with this Board's Policy, I have considered the current version of the NDP in assessing forward-looking risk to the Appellant.11 Thus, it need not be admitted as new evidence here.\n* No New Issues Have Been Raised\n[14] The RPD determined the claim on the issues of absence of a forward-looking risk amounting to persecution for the Appellant in the UAE and found that \"Palestine\" did not constitute a country of former habitual residence for the Appellant on account that it is not recognized as a sovereign State by Canadian authorities. In his Appeal Record, the Appellant argues that these RPD findings are incorrect and that the evidence is sufficient to establish that he faces a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to the OPT and that this is sufficient to make a positive determination on his claim based on the country conditions evidence. In my view, each of the determinative issues in the appeal before me has been raised in the Appeal Record. The Appeal Record was provided to the Minister, pursuant to RAD Rule 3(2). This has given the Minister sufficient notice of the live issues before me in this appeal.\nANALYSIS\n[15] On my own assessment, I agree with the Appellant and find that the RPD incorrectly identified the Appellant's countries of former habitual residence in its reasons (see below - i.). Further, I have examined the evidence on country conditions and consider that there is more than sufficient and credible evidence on the record to support that the Appellant will face a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to the OPT, that state protection would not be forthcoming, and that no viable internal flight alternative (IFA) exists. I can therefore bring finality to the claim (see below - ii.).\ni. The RPD Incorrectly Identified the Appellant's Countries of Former Habitual Residence\n[16] As the Appellant is a stateless Palestinian, he must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in at least one of his countries of former habitual residence and that he cannot return to any other to be successful in his refugee claim.12 Contrary to what the RPD asserts in paragraph 10 of its reasons, it is only necessary to demonstrate that the Appellant would establish a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm in one of his countries of former habitual residence and that he cannot return to the other country or countries of former habitual residence (period). It is not necessary for the Appellant to establish a risk of persecution in each of these countries.13\n[17] Case-law has also established that a country of former habitual residence is considered as such if the Appellant has had a period of significant de facto residence.14\n[18] The Appellant was born in the OPT and also had a work and residency permit in the UAE between 2008 and 2019 when he left. The undisputed evidence is that the Appellant has no entitlement to any nationality.\n[19] Thus, I find that although the RPD had correctly identified the Appellant's countries of former habitual residence as the OPT and the UAE at the hearing15 and included the relevant NDP relating to the OPT in the Consolidated List of Documents16, it later erred in finding - in its reasons - that the OPT could not be considered as such because \"Palestine is not recognized as a country by the Canadian authorities.\"17\n[20] First, from my review of the record, this finding was made in breach of procedural fairness given that the issue of the official status of Palestine was never raised as an issue at the hearing or prior to making the decision - thus preventing the Appellant or his counsel from providing submissions on this point. Instead, at the hearing, a discussion took place with counsel regarding whether the UAE was a secondary country of former habitual residence, and it was clarified by the Appellant that he would not have the possibility to return there today, given that he no longer has the required sponsorship. The RPD accepted this, then asked that counsel provide closing submissions about the risk of persecution for the Appellant in the OPT only.18\n[21] Second, I agree with the arguments put forth by the Appellant regarding the fact that Canada does recognize the Palestinian Authority as the governmental entity in the West Bank and Gaza - this is publicly available information.19 The Appellant has also pointed to the fact that Canada has representation in the city of Ramallah, in the West Bank, currently headed by Ms. Robin Wettlaufer20 and that it interacts directly with the Palestinian Authority and provides aid to it.21 Further, the Appellant points to the fact that this Board itself catalogs documents regarding the Palestinian Authority, listed under Country: Palestinian Territory, Occupied.22\n[22] I find these arguments persuasive and it seems to me that both the Convention and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) refer to a stateless person's country of habitual residence, not a recognized independent State as defined by international law. This is logical in the case of a stateless person who is, by definition, a person without a State. In my view, refugee status determination processes do require, as Justice Grammond has put it, \"assessing the claim in the real world rather than in a hypothetical world.\"23\n[23] This question has already been considered by the Australian Federal Court which, having considered different positions, determined that:\nThere is authority to support the proposition in a certain context that the expression \"country\" can be read as meaning an area or part of the world.24\n[24] And also, that:\nThe objective of the Convention is to provide a practical humanitarian solution to the problems of refugees. It should be interpreted with this objective in mind. Individuals should not be denied the protection of the Convention by an unnecessarily narrow reading of the definition of \"refugee\". It is not appropriate to conclude that an applicant has no recourse under the Convention simply because his or her \"country\" of former habitual residence happens to be a colony or other entity that is not an independent sovereign state.25\n[25] Indeed, I find the RPD's interpretation of what constitutes a country of former habitual residence incompatible with the purpose of the IRPA as set out at s. 3(2)(d): \"to offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\"26\n[26] The Chief Justice in Rosa stressed the importance of the objectives that inform the IRPA, such as granting fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming persecution; offering a safe haven to persons who are able to demonstrate that they are a Convention refugee and establishing fair and efficient procedures that maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system while upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings.27\n[27] In Maarouf, which the Australian Federal Court had also relied upon in the above-cited decision, the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada held that the definition of \"country of former habitual residence\" should not be unduly restrictive so as to pre-empt the provision of \"surrogate\" shelter to a stateless person who has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on any of the grounds enumerated in subsection 2(1) of the Act.28 It noted that this is particularly so because Canada has not ratified the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons29, which renders a stateless claimant who falls outside the Convention refugee definition without recourse in Canada.30 This is still the case today.\n[28] The Supreme Court of Canada has also made clear that the values and principles of customary and conventional international law form part of the context in which Canadian laws are enacted and that to interpret a Canadian law in a way that conflicts with Canada's international obligations risks incursion by the courts in the executive's conduct of foreign affairs and censure under international law - especially where the provision \"has been enacted with a view towards implementing international obligations\".31 This was the case of the IRPA, the refugee protection aspects of which serve principally to discharge Canada's obligations under the Refugee Convention.32\n[29] In fact, if one was to follow the interpretation proposed by the RPD, stateless Palestinians originating from the West Bank or Gaza at risk of persecution would not be covered by the protection of the IRPA or the Convention, as it would never be possible to assess their risk of returning to the OPT. This is despite the reality that these individuals would subsequently be returned there, to persecution - contrary to Canada's international obligations, and to the core customary principle of non-refoulement reiterated in the Refugee Convention and the IRPA.\n[30] The purposive approach is also the one adopted by Refugee Law and Statelessness experts Michelle Foster and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lambert, who argue in their book, International Refugee Law and the Protection of Stateless Persons, that the factual reality is that many stateless persons are stateless precisely because they live in an area controlled by an entity that does not have state recognition and hence is unable to grant nationality. They further argue that the text of the refugee definition in relation to stateless persons, speaks not of \"protection\" of the \"country of former habitual residence\" but merely an inability or unwillingness \"to return to it\", suggesting that a country of former habitual residence need not have the attributes of a state. They conclude that taking into account the protective object and purpose of the Convention, the better view is that country of former habitual residence need not denote a state recognized as such in international law.33\n[31] They also note examples from the French National Asylum Court having considered as a former country of habitual residence the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic because \"the territory has the attributes of a state, such as defined borders, systems of law and a permanent identifiable community\"34 as well as a decision by an Australian tribunal finding that while the OPT is not a State capable of granting nationality, the phrase country of former habitual residence is \"used to denote a country which need not have this capability\".35\n[32] I agree. I find that the OPT fits within the ordinary meaning of the term country and that the territory has the attributes of a state, such as defined borders, systems of law and a permanent identifiable community. As mentioned previously, Canada recognizes the Palestinian Authority as the governmental entity in the West Bank and Gaza.36 Moreover, though residents are subject to the jurisdiction of separate authorities, they are subject to the Palestinian Authority law in the relevant areas, and the Basic Law serves as an interim constitution.37\n[33] The purposive approach also seems to be the one adopted, even if implicitly, by the jurisprudence from this Board and the Canadian Federal Court, which is replete with example of cases where the OPT - whether the West Bank or Gaza - has been assessed as a country of reference.38 What is more, in at least two cases before the Federal Court, it was found that failing to assess Gaza\/the OPT as a country of former habitual residence was an error.39 40\n[34] I have noted only one case from the Federal Court where the official status of the OPT as not a sovereign nation-state was raised, but this argument did not gain traction and was certainly not raised in an attempt to preclude stateless Palestinians originating from the OPT from protection, on the contrary.41 Rather, it was argued by the applicant in that case that the OPT - especially Gaza - are non-contiguous territories in Israel that are precluded from self-governance, military protection, and international relations and, thereby, the country of reference should have been the sovereign state of Israel where Palestinians face daily persecution.42 In that case, however, the applicant originated from Gaza rather than the West Bank. In my view, this is sufficient, on its own, to distinguish the two situations given the significant difference of the realities on the ground - the Palestinian Authority having (some) authority and power to govern in the West Bank - and in particular, the areas known as Zone A - where the Appellant previously resided.43\n[35] Thus, given the purpose and context of the Refugee Convention as outlined above, and the interpretation adopted by its various signatories, it is clear that the OPT can and should be assessed as a country of former habitual residence for a stateless Palestinian seeking Canada's protection.\n[36] Given all the above, I conclude that the RPD erred by refusing to assess the West Bank\/OPT as the Appellant's primary country of former habitual residence. Accordingly, I will now assess the Appellant's situation with regard to his two countries of former habitual residence: the OPT and the UAE.\nii. The Evidence on the Record is Sufficient for the RAD to Bring Finality to the Claim\na) The Appellant has credibly established all material elements of his claim\n[37] The RPD found that the Appellant had credibly established all material elements of his claim, including his conversion and the threats of harm he received from his family members creating a well-founded fear of returning to the OPT.\n[38] Given the Appellant's extensive, detailed, personalized and consistent testimony regarding his growing interest in the Roman Catholic faith while residing in the UAE and his subsequent conversion and resulting threats he faced from family members, as well as his baptism certificate44 and other documentary evidence tendered to support his claims relating to the threats he faces from his family and community45, I agree. I have assessed the forward-looking risk to the Appellant if he returns to the OPT on that basis.\n[39] I further consider that the Appellant has established through his testimony, personal evidence, and the country evidence, his contention that he would be unable to return to the UAE today without the required sponsorship. The copy of his previous UAE residence card shows that it expired in XXXX 201946 and the country evidence confirms that re-entry to the UAE will not be possible based on the previous residency permit.47\n[40] Given the above, it is not necessary for the Appellant to establish a fear of persecution in the UAE in order for his claim to be successful. I will detail below why his fear of persecution throughout the OPT is established.\nb) The evidence is sufficient to establish a forward-looking risk to the Appellant in the OPT\n[41] Having reviewed the totality of the evidence on the record, I find that there is sufficient objective and credible evidence to conclude that the Appellant would face a serious possibility of persecution based on his profile as a convert from Islam to the Roman Catholic faith who is viewed as an apostate and given the threats and physical violence, he faced from family members who oppose his conversion and the evidence tendered in support, showing that members of the XXXX community, more broadly, have declared him as a person \"that deserves death\".48\n[42] I find that his family and other community members would have the motivation to seek and find him if he returned to the OPT today. This is because, the country evidence notes the importance of clans, stating that the clan structure in the OPT is far more consequential than the Bedouin tribes [for example in neighbouring Jordan], and has become even more important since the breakdown of the Palestinian Authority structures during the second uprising, or intifada al-Aqsa, beginning in 2000. It notes that the formal cement that ties together clan members is a mithaq al-sharaf, or code of honour, which is binding on all male members. The mithaq is often a formal written agreement, pages long, that ties together all the disparate families that constitute the hamula. They pledge not only their loyalty to each other but agree that an attack, (physical or honour-based) on one member constitutes an attack on all members of the hamula. Given that Palestinian society shares the honour-shame social system, individual members cannot easily violate this code without dishonouring themselves and their families. It is a powerful social glue, especially in the absence of a functioning state that can provide public security. Absent such a state, the code of vendetta and revenge often becomes dominant.49\nc) The risk to the Appellant exists throughout the OPT\n[43] I further find that this risk of harm to the Appellant extends throughout the West Bank and OPT given that his fear of harm emanates from family members who would eventually become aware of his whereabouts through family contacts and thus would have the means to find him throughout the OPT. Case law is clear that family members or friends should not be expected to put their own lives in danger by denying knowledge of or misleading the agents of persecution as to the Appellant's whereabouts50; he also should not be required to hide from family members and friends in the proposed IFA.51\n[44] Adding to this, country conditions evidence shows that there are severe restrictions on Palestinians' internal and external freedom of movement due to a complex system of bureaucratic, administrative and physical barriers, which include permit requirements, security checks and checkpoints.52 The Appellant cannot simply move to another part of the West Bank - which is already not a large territory. It would require returning to the West Bank and undertaking several administrative processes to access permits, prior to relocating. There is no guarantee that he would obtain said permits.\n[45] According to the UK Home Office, internal relocation between the West Bank and Gaza is likely to be extremely difficult and unreasonable in most cases.53 The UN Human Rights Council further highlights the longstanding restrictions on free movement between Gaza and the West Bank, which includes since 2007 a strict quota system imposed for being allowed to enter or exit Gaza, which was limited to specific categories of persons, such as individuals in need of emergency medical evacuations, medical referral patients, certain businessmen and humanitarian cases. Similarly, a Gaza-based research assistant for Human Rights Watch stated that travel into and out of Gaza is reserved for exceptional cases.54\n[46] It is well established that for a viable IFA to exist, it must be a realistic, attainable option - meaning that the alternative place of safety must be realistically accessible to the Appellant. Any barriers to getting there should be reasonably surmountable. He cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or in staying there.55 I find that the country evidence relating to the various restrictions and permit requirements in place shows, on a balance of probabilities, that internal relocation within the OPT is not a realistically accessible option to the Appellant.\nd) The protection of the Palestinian Authority is not available to the Appellant\n[47] As argued by the Appellant, the Palestinian Authority Basic Law, which serves as an interim constitution, establishes Islam as the official religion and states the principles of sharia shall be the main source of legislation, but provides for freedom of belief, worship, and the performance of religious rites unless they violate public order or morality.56 Country evidence also contains examples of cases where the Palestinian Ministry of the Interior refused to acknowledge the legality of a marriage contracted by a woman who had converted from Islam to the Christian faith - forcing the couple to register their children as born out of wedlock.57\n[48] As mentioned previously, the country evidence shows that clan structure in the OPT has become even more important since the breakdown of the Palestinian Authority structures and that given that Palestinian society shares the honour-shame social system, the code of vendetta and revenge often becomes dominant.58\n[49] In my opinion, given the importance of the clan structure throughout the OPT, the breakdown of the Palestinian Authority structures reported by country evidence - clear and convincing evidence exists that the Appellant, who has violated the basic tenets of Islam given his status as an apostate, would not be in a position to avail himself the protection of the Palestinian Authority against his family's clan and community if he returned to the OPT today.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] In sum, based on the personal evidence adduced by the Appellant and its broad consistency with the documentary evidence, I accept that the Appellant's profile as a stateless Palestinian and Roman Catholic convert, perceived as an apostate by his family and community members in the West Bank, creates a serious possibility of persecution on account of his religion and membership in a particular social group (individuals contravening social and religious mores) if he returns to the OPT today.\n[51] It is important to remember that the Appellant is not required to establish that this risk exists beyond a reasonable doubt or even on a balance of probabilities, but rather that there exists \"more than a mere possibility\"59 that he would face persecution from his family or community members anywhere in the OPT, and I find that he has established this in light of the country evidence.\n[52] Given all the above, I consider that the Appellant has established that he will face a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to the OPT, that adequate state protection is not available to him, and that no viable IFA exists. He has also established that he is unable to return to the UAE, given that he has lost any right to work or reside there.\nDECISION\n[53] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention Refugee.\n(signed)\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nFebruary 25, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, RPD Reasons, paras. 16-35.\n2 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, Appellant's Memorandum, pp. 15-21.\n3 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Schedule A, p. 62.\n4 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Palestinian Authority Travel Document, p. 148.\n5 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Jordanian Travel Document, p. 147.\n6 Exhibit RAD-1, National Documentation Package (NDP), Jordan, 17 December 2021, tab 3.8: ?Palestine and Jordan: Passports issued to stateless Palestinians by the government of Jordan, including procedures, entitlements, differences between Jordanian passports issued to Jordanian nationals and those issued to stateless Palestinians...

The police refused to carry out the eviction order because XXXX XXXX was their colleague.\n[11] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, the principal appellant was assaulted by three men while leaving his mother's house. These men told him that he and his family would be killed if he did not drop the case.\n[12] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, the appellants permanently left Mexico for Montr\u00e9al.\n[13] On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the appellants signed their BOC Form, seeking Canada's protection.\n[14] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, the adult associate appellant made additions to her written account, stating that at the age of 18, she became a Jehovah's Witness and was persecuted in 2010 for her refusal to receive a transfusion while giving birth to her third daughter.\n[15] The associate appellant also stated that her three minor daughters were discriminated against at their school by their teachers because they did not take part in celebrating Christmas, Easter and birthdays.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[16] The RAD reviews RPD decisions using the correctness standard of review after conducting its own analysis of the record. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage with respect to the credibility assessment.6 That being said, the role of the RAD is to determine whether the RPD did in fact err, as alleged by the appellants.\n[17] The RAD applied the correctness standard of review in this case.\nANALYSIS\nDid the Refugee Protection Division err in its assessment of the internal flight alternative?\n[18] In Rasaratnam7 and Thirunavukkarasu,8 the Federal Court of Appeal defines the test to be applied to assess an IFA. The test is two-pronged:\n1. ...the Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.9\n2. Conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.10\n[19] Both prongs must be satisfied in order to conclude that there is an IFA.\n[20] The RPD concluded that the appellants failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the existence of conditions that would jeopardize their lives and safety in the proposed IFA, the city of Quer\u00e9taro. The appellants could live and work in that city and it would not be unreasonable for them to relocate to that city.11\nFirst prong\n[21] The first prong must be analyzed from the perspective of the agent of persecution, that is, their interest in pursuing a refugee protection claimant in the area proposed as an IFA and their ability to find the claimant. Once those aspects have been analyzed, the refugee protection claimant's personal circumstances and the circumstances of the people living in the IFA location must be considered.\n[22] The RPD asked the principal appellant about the possibility of relocating to Quer\u00e9taro. He responded that because the house occupied by XXXX XXXX XXXX belonged to them (him and his wife) and because the complaint filed against XXXX had damaged his reputation, he could seek revenge and easily locate them because he is a federal police officer.12\n[23] The RPD was not satisfied with these explanations regarding the reasons why XXXX would currently seek him out, because they are based on speculation. The principal appellant testified that, when he was attacked by three people in XXXX 2017, they demanded that he drop the case with XXXX, which the principal appellant did by deciding to cease his efforts to reclaim his house. He also testified that he never received any other threats after that date, despite the fact that he still lived in the same location.13\n[24] The appellants argue that the RPD's conclusion that XXXX no longer has an interest in pursuing them in another part of Mexico is based on speculation. First, XXXX does not know that the appellants do not intend to continue their fight to reclaim their property and, moreover, the RPD does not know whether XXXX no longer intends to pursue the appellants in another region, especially since he is a federal police officer.14\n[25] The appellants add that the agent of persecution did not track them down between the XXXX 2017 attack and their final departure from Mexico on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, because this was a short period of time, although they have experienced problems related to their property since 2012.15\n[26] Last, the appellants consider that they still have an order allowing them to evict XXXX from their property, which will trigger his interest in finding them in order to avoid being reported and challenged once more and having damage caused to a federal police officer's reputation.16 In 2015, they received several threatening messages asking them to drop the case or they would be killed and, in 2016, the principal appellant was pulled over by the traffic police, who asked him to stop the proceeding and leave their colleague alone.17\n[27] The RAD cannot accept these arguments.\n[28] First, the principal appellant testified that he was assaulted and threatened several times while attempting to reclaim his property (either directly or through legal action), and that, starting with the XXXX 2017 assault, when he decided to cease all efforts to reclaim the property, neither he nor his family was ever assaulted or threatened again, despite the fact that they still lived in the same location.\n[29] Next, the principal appellant testified that his persecutor-the traffic police or the three individuals who assaulted him in XXXX 2017-only asked him to cease his efforts, which he did, and he also stated that he does not intend to make further efforts in the future.\n[30] The agent of persecution has not attempted to locate or threaten the appellants in the same city since they ceased their efforts to reclaim the house, which demonstrates that XXXX no longer has an interest in doing so. The proposed IFA is located 540 kilometres from Mexico City.\n[31] The RAD is of the opinion that the appellants failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that their agent of persecution has an interest in tracking them down in Quer\u00e9taro.\n[32] Consequently, the fear expressed by the appellants is entirely hypothetical. Therefore, even when considering this fear, the RPD correctly concluded that they failed to discharge their burden of establishing the required risk under the first prong of the IFA test.\n[33] With regard to the first prong of the IFA analysis, the RAD is of the opinion that the evidence submitted does not establish that the appellants would face a serious possibility of persecution or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they had to settle in the proposed city in Mexico.\nSecond prong\n[34] The RPD asked the appellants whether there were any other reasons that prevented them from living in Quer\u00e9taro apart from their problem with XXXX. The principal appellant initially responded in the negative, then stated that they were Jehovah's Witnesses.\n[35] The RPD previously concluded that the problems regarding their religion do not reach the required threshold of severity to amount to persecution or to one of the risks set out in subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[36] Last, the RPD analyzed the documents submitted by the appellants in relation to the corruption in the proposed IFA, specifically within the police (news articles); they argued that they could be found in Quer\u00e9taro for this reason. The RPD stated that it did not believe that XXXX would have an interest in locating the appellants, who failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it would be unreasonable for them to settle in Quer\u00e9taro18 since the rate of corruption in that city is the lowest in Mexico and the principal appellant's job as an XXXX XXXX could, on a balance of probabilities, continue in another state.\n[37] The appellants argue that the choice of an IFA must reasonably allow them to rebuild their lives, not send them to the country's least terrible area. They state that the objective evidence indicates that Quer\u00e9taro recorded the highest increase in extortion in Mexico and that the principal appellant was threatened by the police officers who pulled him over while he worked as an XXXX XXXX. In addition, the appellants have no family or friends in this city and the high rate of corruption would jeopardize their lives and safety.19\n[38] Last, the appellants cite the case law, the Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status Under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly the paragraphs involving religious persecution, to argue that the RPD assessed the events they experienced as Jehovah's Witnesses individually, not cumulatively.20\n[39] The appellants argue that the events they experienced as Jehovah's Witnesses cumulatively amount to persecution21 and that the objective evidence clearly states that they cannot freely express their religious faith.22\n[40] The RAD cannot accept these unfounded arguments.\n[41] First, the principal appellant is a 35-year-old man with several years of work experience in XXXX and as an XXXX XXXX. He has a high school education.\n[42] Based on this experience, the RAD is of the opinion that it would not be unreasonable for the appellants to settle in Quer\u00e9taro.\n[43] As for the situation in that city, generalized corruption exists throughout the country, according to the objective evidence. The RAD is of the opinion that for a claim to be allowed under section 97 of the IRPA, the appellants must establish that the risk they would face, if they returned to Mexico, is different than the generalized risk faced by all or part of the Mexican population.\n[44] Second, the discriminatory events the associate appellant experienced during childbirth and those experienced by her daughters at their school due to them being Jehovah's Witnesses are certainly traumatic. However, there is nothing in their testimony that indicates that these events reached the threshold of persecution.\n[45] The Supreme Court of Canada, in reliance on the scholarship of Professor James Hathaway, defined persecution as \"'sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.'\"23 In another case, the Supreme Court of Canada held that \"[t]he essential question is whether the persecution alleged by the claimant threatens his or her basic human rights in a fundamental way.\"24\n[46] Furthermore, the Federal Court of Appeal in Sagharichi, while recognizing that \"the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish\",25 found that, with persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious and systemic. The systemic element of persecution refers to \"the element of repetition and relentlessness found at the heart of persecution.\"\n[47] The RAD is of the opinion that the RPD did not err in its conclusions regarding the appellants' faith, because the associate appellant was able to give birth at a private clinic that has the ability to provide blood transfusion alternatives suggested by Jehovah's Witnesses. In addition, the associate appellant failed to establish that the Mexican public hospital had the ability to provide these alternatives.\n[48] The RPD also stated in its decision that the associate appellant does not qualify under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA because the inability to provide certain medical services falls within the exception under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv) of the IRPA, which excludes the inability of a country to provide medical care from the definition of persons in need of protection.26\n[49] With respect to the problems the daughters had at their school (mistreatment by their teachers and other students), these events do not reach the threshold of persecution because they do not constitute a sustained violation of their basic human rights. The daughters were able to change schools.\n[50] In addition, a number of tabs from the National Documentation Package on Mexico indicate that state protection exists in Mexico and, although it is not perfect, it is adequate. Nothing in the objective evidence indicates that Jehovah's Witnesses are persecuted in this country. The RAD is satisfied that the appellants could settle in the proposed IFA.\n[51] The documentary evidence available to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) indicates that Mexico is a democracy with free and fair elections and a relatively independent and impartial judiciary. After analyzing the documents related to the country conditions, the RAD is of the opinion that Mexico has efficient control over its territory and is home to an established security service to enforce its laws and constitution. Nothing in the documentary evidence before the IRB suggests that Mexico is in a state of complete collapse.\n[52] In addition, as the case law establishes,27 the threshold is very high in terms of what makes an IFA unreasonable in the particular circumstances. This high standard requires evidence demonstrating the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the refugee protection claimant in travelling to the IFA location and staying there.28\n[53] It is not a matter of a refugee protection claimant's convenience or the attractiveness of the IFA.29 The appellants had to establish that the proposed IFA would jeopardize their lives or safety.\n[54] The RPD's conclusion is correct.\nDid the Refugee Protection Division breach the principles of procedural fairness?\n[55] The appellants argue that the RPD breached the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice by questioning the principal appellant during his second hearing even though the RPD's questioning had ended, without prior notice to the appellants, which took them by surprise and violated their right to make full answer and defence.30\n[56] The appellants cite section B of Chairperson's Guideline 7 on the Preparation and Conduct of a Hearing in the Refugee Protection Division and rule 10 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (RPD Rules), which set out the order of questioning.31\n[57] The appellants add that, during the hearing, their counsel stated that the RPD breached procedural fairness by changing the order of questioning, and that the fact they raised an objection during the hearing means that the issue involving the application of Guideline 7 can be argued before the RAD.32\n[58] Therefore, the appellants criticize the RPD for breaching procedural fairness and, for that reason alone, the RAD must set aside the RPD's determination and refer the matter to the RPD for rehearing in order to restore the right to a fair process in the circumstances.33\n[59] The RAD disagrees.\n[60] First, contrary to the argument put forth by the appellants' counsel, the RPD did follow the order of questioning during the hearing. At the beginning of the first hearing, it did announce that the order of questioning would be the usual order set out in rule 10 of the RPD Rules. The RPD member stated the following in reference to the organization of the hearing: [translation] \"Therefore, this hearing has been scheduled for three hours. I will ask questions during the first part of the sitting, then your counsel will have time to ask questions and make submissions.\"34\n[61] The RPD followed this order. However, at the start of the second hearing (August 5, 2021), the RPD stated that it had a few questions following the submission of certain exhibits on July 26, 2021, (12 days after the first hearing), to complete the exhibit sheet submitted in evidence.35 The appellants' counsel did not object at that time. The RPD proceeded with its questions. Counsel intervened several times, to the point of being called to order by the RPD because she was responding for the associate appellant.36\n[62] It was only at the end of this hearing that counsel, while presenting her submissions after asking the appellants questions, expressed her desire to raise a breach of natural justice and procedural fairness.37\n[63] Counsel stated at the start of her submissions that, during the first RPD hearing (July 14, 2021), the RPD had stated that it had ended its questions and that it was her turn to ask her own. However, the reopening of the RPD question period during the second hearing was stressful for the appellants and threw their counsel off, which constitutes a breach of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[64] With respect, the RAD cannot agree with these arguments. Where procedural fairness is concerned, consideration must be given to whether the principles of natural justice were respected, taking into account the specific context of the case in question.38\n[65] The RAD reviewed the entirety of the record and listened to the entire recording of both hearings (for a total of over five hours). Throughout, the member was courteous and professional, making sure the appellants understood the questions and constantly repeating them when their statements seemed inconsistent. She suggested breaks when she noticed that the appellants were nervous.\n[66] The RAD is of the opinion that the RPD showed empathy and made sure the appellants felt comfortable, regained their composure and were able to testify. It even agreed to hold a second hearing to provide the appellants' counsel with all the necessary time to ask questions and present submissions (two hours).\n[67] In addition, the RPD clearly stated in its reasons that it had reviewed the comments made by the appellants' counsel but that, in its view, there was no breach of natural justice. It correctly stated that it was entitled to reopen its case as long as it allowed counsel to speak last, which it did.\n[68] The purpose of procedural fairness is to ensure that refugee protection claimants understand the proceedings, have a reasonable opportunity to tender any evidence that supports their claim and are given a chance to persuade the RPD that their claim is well-founded.39\n[69] In this case, the RPD took the entirety of the evidence into account. The appellants understood the procedure, submitted evidence in support of their claim and were given a chance to persuade the RPD that their claim was well-founded.\n[70] The RPD correctly followed the order of questioning and was entitled to ask new questions, following the submission of new exhibits, to ensure that it covered every element in the appellants' record.\n[71] Section 9 of the Code of Conduct for Members of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada states the following: \"Members shall conduct hearings in a courteous and respectful manner while ensuring that the proceedings are fair, orderly and efficient.\"\n[72] Like the RPD, the RAD is of the opinion that the appellants must be prepared to testify at every hearing to finalize their case. No question in relation to the evidence should surprise them.\n[73] As a result, the appellants' argument in this respect is unfounded. The RPD granted several opportunities to them and their counsel to express their concerns, and responded favourably to all of their requests. The RAD considers that the appellants had an independent, impartial and objective member.\n[74] In light of the foregoing, the RAD is of the opinion that there was no breach of the principles of natural justice and that the appellants have an IFA in Quer\u00e9taro.\n[75] The RAD concludes that the RPD's decision is correct.\nCONCLUSION\n[76] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the RPD's determination that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[77] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nMokhtar Lamani\nMokhtar Lamani\nApril 6, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 P-2, Appellant's record, Appellants' memorandum, Part I, at para. 1.\n2 Ibid., at para. 2.\n3 Ibid., at para. 3.\n4 Ibid.

Motifs et d\u00e9cision\nPersons who are the subject of the appeal\nXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX\nPersonnes en cause\nDate of decision\nFebruary 7, 2022\nDate de la d\u00e9cision\nPanel\nNormand Leduc\nTribunal\nCounsel for the persons who are the subject of the appeal\nLouis Nadeau\nConseil des personnes en cause\nDesignated representative\nN\/A\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX (the female appellant) and her husband, XXXX XXXX (the male appellant), both citizens of Iran, are appealing against the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) to reject their refugee protection claim.\n[2] In rendering its decision, the panel took into account the Chairperson's Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\n[3] For the following reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The appellants lived in the city of Tehran. The female appellant was a university professor and the male appellant worked as an engineer.\n[5] In their Basis of Claim Forms (BOC Forms), the appellants allege that they fear being charged with apostasy in Iran for having converted to Christianity.\n[6] The appellants alleged that they attended a Christian church in Tehran in 2019, after their daughter willingly converted in Canada, where she was studying and had claimed refugee protection.\n[7] The appellants left Iran in XXXX 2020 for Canada, where they also claimed refugee protection. They alleged that they attended a Christian church in Canada and were baptized there.\n[8] Before the RPD, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (the Minister), through his representative, intervened by filing a Notice to Intervene and documentary evidence, alleging, among other things, that the similarities observed between the appellants' BOC Forms and those of 23 other Iranian claimants' BOC Forms (filed in evidence) undermined the credibility of their allegations.\n[9] Following a hearing on May 14, 2021, the RPD rejected the refugee protection claim finding that the appellants' central allegations were not credible. The RPD also found that the evidence presented did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran for the female appellant on the basis of her membership in the particular social group of \"women.\"\n[10] Before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), the appellants argue that the RPD erred in its assessment of their credibility for the reasons that are set out under the Analysis heading.\n[11] For these reasons, the appellants are asking the RAD to allow the appeal and grant them refugee protection.\n[12] The Minister did not intervene before the RAD.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW AND ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[13] The role of the RAD is to review RPD decisions by applying the correctness standard of review after conducting its own analysis of the record in order to determine whether the RPD erred, as submitted by the appellants.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[14] The first issue to be decided in this case is whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the appellants' credibility.\n[15] After analyzing the evidence presented, including listening to the recording of the RPD hearing and reviewing the RPD's reasons as well as the appellants' submissions, I am of the view that the answer to this question is no, for the following reasons.\n[16] The RPD's conclusion is based primarily on the similarities observed between the appellants' BOC Forms and the 23 BOC Forms filed in evidence by the Minister. For this situation, the RPD applied the framework of analysis recommended in persuasive decision - RAD TB7-16268, which is summarized in paragraph 52 of that decision as follows:\n1. Sworn evidence is presumed to be true unless there is reason to doubt its truthfulness;\n2. The presumption may be displaced by a strikingly similar BoC narrative(s) from an unrelated claim or claims;\n3. How similar the narratives have to be to displace the presumption is a question of fact, but if a member is satisfied that they are similar enough to displace the presumption, the claimant needs to be put on notice;\n4. The claimant now has to establish on a balance of probabilities that his or her BoC narrative has not been fabricated;\n5. The claimant is provided an opportunity to provide an explanation. This can include oral evidence from the claimant and\/or witnesses, relying on aspects of the merits of the claim as well as documentary evidence, or any other evidence the claimant elects to bring forward;\n6. The member considers the explanation;\n7. The member accepts the explanation and continues with the claim or provides sufficient reasons that clearly articulate why the claimant's explanations did not, on a balance of probabilities, demonstrate that the BoC narrative was a true representation of their story;\n8. The member accepts the explanation and continues with the claim or provides sufficient reasons that clearly articulate why the claimant's explanations did not, on a balance of probabilities, demonstrate that the BoC narrative was a true representation of their story.\n[17] In this case, the RPD adopted steps 1 to 6 of this analysis and concluded that the appellants failed to meet their burden of establishing that their written accounts (contained in the BOC Forms) were indeed theirs. The RPD [translation] \"distinguishes between\" steps 7 and 8 of the framework of analysis to assess whether the events that occurred after the writing of the written accounts, namely attendance at a church in Canada, could establish well-founded fear of persecution for the appellants, and whether membership in the particular social group of [translation] \"women\" could establish a well-founded fear of persecution for the female appellant. In both cases, the RPD is of the opinion that they cannot. These conclusions will be discussed later.\n[18] In their memorandum, the appellants do not deny that there are similarities between their written accounts and those submitted by the Minister, although they argue that the RPD erred in failing to consider their explanations on the matter, namely that the interpreter who prepared their written accounts used a template, and that it is therefore plausible that the written accounts of claimants fearing persecution in Iran on the same grounds are similar.\n[19] My conclusion on this matter is the same as that of the RPD.\n[20] In analyzing the documentary evidence filed by the Minister before the RPD, I can only note many similarities between the appellants' written accounts and those of the 23 other Iranian refugee protection claimants, similarities that will not be necessary to re-examine in detail in this decision.\n[21] When asked by the RPD about these similarities, the female appellant first replied that she had no explanation. She added that, perhaps, the other claimants [translation] \"have the same problems\" and that the similarities may be due to the fact that they and the other claimants used the same interpreter to prepare their written accounts.\n[22] Next, I note, as did the RPD, that it is plausible that an interpreter using a template could write similar sentences about what affects all claimants who base their claim on conversion to Christianity, such as the fact that they may be charged with apostasy and face the death penalty if returned to Iran, an allegation that was formulated the same way in the appellants' written accounts and in several of the written accounts filed by the Minister. Or, for example, the answers to question 2(c) of the BOC Form regarding state protection, which are identical in all forms.\n[23] However, this explanation is not reasonable with respect to the personal details of each of these claimants. The use of a template cannot reasonably explain the similarities found with respect to details that should be personal to each of these claimants, for example, regarding their conversion to Christianity, which allegedly began in Iran. For example, the allegation that the appellants were introduced to Christianity by a neighbour (Rita), who then brought them to a church, is common to almost all the BOC Forms filed by the Minister. The presence of police officers verifying the identity of people who would go to church is also common to several BOC Forms filed by the Minister.\n[24] Another allegation in the female appellant's written account is also found in most of the written accounts filed by the Minister, namely that the female appellant joined an Iranian women's association in Canada for the purpose of defending women's rights. When asked about this, the female appellant replied that she had not joined such an association, but allegedly told the interpreter of her intention to do so. I find, as did the RPD, that this is another example of similar allegations that undermines the appellants' credibility.\n[25] In their memorandum, on the issue of similarities between the written accounts, the appellants criticize the RPD for asking questions on this critical topic for only about 12 minutes of the hearing, and for not asking to hear the testimony of a Canadian pastor who allegedly baptized them after their arrival in Canada.\n[26] I cannot accept these criticisms of the RPD.\n[27] First, the time spent asking questions, or the number of questions asked on the topic, cannot, of themselves, result in a lack of transparency or fairness in the panel's approach, as submitted by the appellants. What matters is the relevance of the questions asked. And in this case, the questions asked on this subject were relevant, and the appellants had the opportunity to answer, explain and comment on the similarities between the written accounts. Moreover, the appellants knew that this subject was a point of contention at the hearing, having received the Minister's intervention beforehand, and their counsel had the opportunity to ask them all the relevant questions on this topic, if he considered it necessary to obtain more explanations from them, which he did not do.\n[28] As for the pastor's testimony, the appellants and their counsel had the opportunity to ask the RPD to hear him, if they deemed it necessary, which they did not do.\nFurthermore, I am not of the view that this testimony would have been relevant in any case with respect to explaining the similarities between the written accounts, as the pastor did not witness the alleged events in Iran or witness the circumstances in which the appellants' BOC forms were prepared.\n[29] Finally, I also take into account in my analysis the fact that the appellants have not filed any objective evidence to support their allegations about their conversion or church attendance in Iran. The evidence filed about their religious conversion in Canada will be discussed below under the heading \"Refugees sur place\".\n[30] I therefore conclude that the evidence presented demonstrates, on a balance of probabilities, that the appellants' written accounts appended to their BOC forms are not truly their own, and that the allegations made in them are not credible.\nRefugees sur place\n[31] The RPD considers that its conclusion that the appellants' written accounts were not really their own could only affect the sincerity of their conversion to Christianity, which allegedly occurred in Canada. In this regard, the appellants filed baptismal certificates and photographs of the ceremony, which was allegedly held in XXXX 2020 at a church affiliated with the Baptist Church of Canada.\n[32] Doubting the sincerity of the appellants' religious conversion, the RPD was of the view that there would not be a well-founded fear of persecution in their case if they were to return to Iran, given that the documentary evidence on the record states that the persons who have converted and still practise the Christian religion in Iran, or those who have already had problems with the authorities, are at risk of persecution, which is not the case for the appellants.\n[33] In their memorandum, the appellants argue that the RPD erred on the basis of the documents filed demonstrating their Christian baptism, and their uncontradicted testimony as to the reasons that led to this conversion.\n[34] In my view, the appellants have not demonstrated that the RPD's determination in this regard is erroneous.\n[35] First, I am also of the view that the conclusion that the appellants' written accounts are not really their own can only undermine their overall credibility, including with respect to the events that allegedly occurred following the writing of those accounts.\n[36] Second, I am of the view that the appellants' testimony as to why they would have been drawn to Christianity was, on balance, rather vague and general. When asked about this issue, the female appellant responded that she was against the Islamic revolution that occurred in her country in the late 1970s, and that the Islamic religion discriminated against women. The male appellant, for his part, stated that he was allegedly detained by the authorities [translation] \"when he was 26 years old,\" so around 1979, and released following a friend's intervention. It must be noted that these events occurred some 40 years before the appellants' alleged expression of interest in Christianity.\n[37] Nor did the appellants explain why they would have joined the ranks of a Baptist church in Canada instead of any other Christian denomination.\n[38] Third, when asked who would be aware of their religious conversion, the female appellant responded that, in her view, no one knows, but that there may nonetheless be [translation] \"spies\" in Canada. I find that the objective evidence does not support the existence of spies in Canada who could inform the Iranian authorities; rather, this is speculation on the part of the female appellant.\n[39] For these reasons, I am also of the view that the appellants' religious conversion in Canada does not demonstrate that they would continue to practise Christianity if they were to return to Iran.\n[40] Lastly, I am also of the view that the evidence submitted does not establish that the appellants would have had problems that were significant enough in the past to establish a well-founded fear of persecution if they were to return to their country.\n[41] When asked about this issue, the female appellant responded that she had had problems due to wearing the Islamic headscarf (hijab). She was allegedly taken in to the religious police with her daughter, at the time a student, and later released. She was also allegedly warned about it while teaching at the university. As for the male appellant, as mentioned above, he was allegedly detained once, around 1979. There was no follow-up to these events, and I consider them insufficient to establish, for example, that the appellants are opponents of the regime.\nWomen\n[42] The RPD analyzed the female appellant's claim in respect of her membership in the particular social group of \"women,\" and it concluded that, in her case, the evidence presented did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran on this ground.\n[43] In their memorandum, the appellants only briefly challenged that determination, submitting that the documentary evidence indicates that women in Iran are victims of repression and subject to a dress code that requires them to wear the hijab (paragraph 22 of the memorandum).\n[44] In analyzing the evidence presented, I come to the same conclusion as the RPD on this matter, primarily for two reasons.\n[45] When asked at the outset of the hearing at what point she began to be afraid in Iran, the female appellant responded without hesitation that it was when she started attending church. So, around 2019.\n[46] It was only when asked if she had personally had any problems with the authorities that she mentioned that she had been detained with her daughter, a student at the time, because she wore a hijab which was prohibited. She also mentioned that she had had some problems as a university professor, and complained that she was forced to follow certain religious principles, such as participating in prayer.\n[47] It appears to me that this ground for fear is incidental to the claim, which is, above all, based on the religious conversion. And this seems to me all the more evidenced by the following.\n[48] When asked why they did not claim asylum during trips they made to XXXX in 2018 and XXXX in 2019, the female appellant replied that they [translation] \"had not decided to claim asylum.\"\n[49] I find that failure to claim in these European countries and these voluntary returns to Iran demonstrate the female appellant's lack of subjective fear based on her membership in the particular social group of \"women.\"\n[50] Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, I conclude that the appellants failed to demonstrate that the RPD had made errors warranting the intervention of the RAD.\nREMEDY\n[51] For these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are not \"Convention refugees\" under section 96 of the IRPA, nor \"persons in need of protection\" under section 97 of the IRPA.\n[52] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nFebruary 7, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\nRAD File No. \/ No. de dossier de la SAR : MC1-08187\nMC1-08188\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du\nCanada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and their minor son, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, for whom the male appellant is the designated representative, are citizens of Honduras. The male appellant alleges that he was targeted by the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang because he witnessed tractor parts being stolen on June 15, 2015, while working as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Two weeks later, he had to move 45 minutes away when two of the individuals who had been involved in the theft stopped in front of his home for a long time. On July 15, 2015, he heard three gunshots when he was leaving his new home. He ran into his home to hide, as he was convinced that he was the target. He moved again after that. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, he quit his job to join another company. The gang regularly intercepted him in his neighbourhood and questioned him about his comings and goings. After being hired by a Canadian company in February 2017, he arrived in XXXX and was met with deplorable working conditions. Faced with health problems, he claimed refugee protection on March 6, 2018.\n[2] His wife states that in December 2017, as she was leaving work, she was intercepted by an individual who asked about her husband. In June 2018, two armed men came to her home and asked about him again, telling her to remind him of the benefits of staying silent. She then decided to move into her mother's home. In January 2019, an MS gang member came to her mother's home and extorted 500 lempiras per week from her, as her son-in-law is abroad. She applied for a US visa in the summer of 2019. Accompanied by her minor child, she left for the United States on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, and travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, where she claimed refugee protection on December 13, 2019.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) determined that the claimants are neither \"Convention refugees\" nor \"persons in need of protection,\" noting the following:\n- the male appellant's inconsistent testimony about the motivation of the agents of harm;\n- behaviour that is inconsistent with that of a person who alleges that they would be subjected to a risk to their life, to a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture;\n- the failure to clearly explain the association of MS-13 as their agents of harm; and\n- inconsistent behaviour and vague and inconsistent testimony.\n[4] The appellants' memorandum submits that the RPD erred in its decision as it:\n- breached procedural fairness and the principle of natural justice in relation to a Convention ground within the meaning of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act when it concluded that they would not be persecuted by reason of their political opinion;\n- did not take the documents submitted in evidence into account;\n- raised speculation to make findings with regard to the male appellant's credibility; and\n- described behaviour that was explained in a sensible way as inconsistent.\n[5] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division is credibility.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD correctly determined that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[7] My role is to review all of the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.1 Mr. XXXX was warned to remain silent following the robbery he witnessed during his shift as a XXXX XXXX in June 2015. To persuade him further, two of the thieves stopped outside his home two weeks later and stared him down. Despite moving 45 minutes away, he was shot at on July 15, 2015, as he was leaving his neighbourhood. He moved again and changed jobs on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, eventually leaving Honduras in 2017 after accepting a job in Canada.\n[8] His wife was questioned by individuals who asked her about her husband as she was leaving work in December 2017. In June 2018, two men went to her home and asked her where her husband was again, reminding her that it was best for him to stay silent. After moving into her mother's home, they were approached by a gang member from the neighbourhood who extorted 500 lempiras from them every week. After obtaining a US visa in summer 2019, she left Honduras with her child in XXXX 2019 and went to the US before travelling to Canada.\nProcedural fairness and the principle of natural justice in the conclusion that they would not be persecuted by reason of their political opinion\n[9] First, the RPD noted counsel's submission that the appellants' situation falls under the umbrella of persecution on the grounds of political opinion. The argument that was made is that confronting the system of corruption and crime that MS-13 has built amounts to a political opinion. In response to the argument, the RPD noted that the male appellant never made an official complaint against MS-13 and that his wife continues to pay the war tax (cuota) through her mother. It concluded that they are victims of crime and added that, according to the case law established in Ward,2 that is insufficient to meet the criteria required to establish membership in a particular social group-one of the five Convention grounds.\n[10] Referring to the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Honduras, taken from Tab 1.5 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Honduras,3 the male appellant's memorandum submits that such an interpretation would be erroneous. According to this document, expressing objections to a gang's criminal activities, including refusing to pay extortion, may be considered as amounting to an imputed political opinion. It also states that witnesses of crimes committed by a gang may be in need of international refugee protection on the ground of political opinion.\n[11] The memorandum argues that the RPD did not address this issue by remaining silent about this evidence. The failure to refer to it leads to the conclusion that it failed to consider all the evidence before it, which constitutes a breach.\n[12] However, the passage from Tab 1.5 of the NDP, which the male appellant's memorandum refers to, is not as categorical as counsel suggests in his argument. The passage specifies that what is stated depends on the particular circumstances of the case. The RPD correctly noted that the appellants did not take any action that would suggest an objection to demands from gangs. As an example, it noted that the male appellant never filed a complaint and that his wife continues to pay extortion. Furthermore, the circumstance that would open the door to obtaining protection on the ground of political opinion does not apply in this case, but instead applies to the cases of individuals who witness criminal acts involving state agents. The RPD was correct in its conclusion regarding the absence of persecution by reason of the appellants' political opinion.\nConsideration of documents submitted in evidence\n[13] The male appellant's memorandum submits that it is due to its finding concerning the appellants' lack of credibility that the RPD did not give any weight to the documents submitted in evidence. According to the memorandum, proceeding in this manner is problematic since evidence in support of allegations should be examined in parallel in order to assess the credibility of the reported event in light of the evidence submitted in support of it.\na. Employment-related evidence\n[14] The RPD stated that it considered the documentary evidence submitted to circumstantially establish the male appellant's employment as a security guard and that establishing his mother's inability to obtain further evidence of employment (exhibits P-13, P-14 and P-15). It did not give them any weight as they would not remedy the credibility findings that were made.\n[15] According to the appellants' memorandum, the failure to consider this evidence is unreasonable.\n[16] With respect to the written account, there is reason to distinguish facts that can be assumed to be true, but which, following analysis, do not establish the credibility of an event or the reason why it occurred. The RPD did not doubt that the male appellant worked as a XXXX XXXX for a company. The reasons why he was unable to obtain proof of employment were not an issue. However, the subsequent actions or motivations for those actions are what it did not find credible. Nevertheless, it was an error to not give any weight to the documents submitted, even though they are ultimately unable to remedy the credibility findings.\nb. Evidence related to the extortion payments (cuota)\n[17] The RPD did not give any weight to the documents related to paying the cuota (exhibits P-11 and P-12) and concluded that they do not remedy its credibility findings or its conclusions regarding the link between the payment and the triggering event in June 2015.\n[18] The male appellant's memorandum submits that considerable weight should have been given to them and that this evidence was sufficient to dispel any doubts about the alleged extortion they experienced.\n[19] It also argues that the newspaper articles that were submitted (Exhibit P-20) demonstrate the magnitude of the danger of falling victim to MS-13, which is an objective criterion.\n[20] Three and a half years passed between the triggering event (June 2015) and the extortion demand (January 2019). During this time, the male appellant and his family moved twice to neighbourhoods that were controlled by another gang. He left Honduras in XXXX 2017 and his wife was shouted at in December 2017 and again in June 2018. In January 2019, she and her mother were extorted while living together.\n[21] The RPD's conclusion took into account the extended length of time between the two incidents, the appellants' numerous moves since the initial incident to locations under the control of different gangs, and the limited information that could be used to identify the concerned party.\n[22] The incident in January 2019 and the evidence establishing that they are victims of extortion should be considered. However, it is correct to conclude that this situation is not related to the incident in June 2015 given the above-noted credibility problems. The RPD did not question that the female appellant and her mother were targets of extortion. However, there is reason to doubt that it was a consequence of a past event.\n[23] The memorandum also argues that the RPD should have analyzed the incident in January 2019 in parallel with the incident in June 2015. However, although the evidence submitted may paint a portrait of the entire situation, it must be analyzed chronologically in order to determine whether one was a result or consequence of the other. In this case, I consider that the RPD was correct in concluding that there was no connection between the two incidents. There is reason to find it credible that the female appellant and her mother were victims of extortion without considering that it resulted from the incident in June 2015.\n[24] Last, despite the position put forward in the male appellant's memorandum, the evidence of the male appellant's treatment in Canada does not clarify the alleged situation in Honduras for the RPD. The truthfulness of his experience in Canada is in no way evidence of the credibility of past events. The RPD was correct in not taking this into account.\n[25] Under the heading [translation] \"Consideration of documents submitted in evidence,\" the male appellant's memorandum argues that the RPD failed to consider Chairperson's Guideline 8: Procedures with Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB. The argument is that, as a result of what Mr. XXXX experienced both in Honduras and in Canada, he should be considered a vulnerable person.\n[26] However, Guideline 8 defines a vulnerable person as an individual whose ability to present their case before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada is severely impaired, either by mental illness, age, having been a victim of torture, or having survived genocide or crimes against humanity. It also includes women who have suffered gender-related persecution and individuals who have been victims of persecution based on sexual orientation and gender identity. These examples do not apply in this case.\nSpeculations raised to make findings about the male appellant's credibility\n[27] The RPD expressed reservations about the male appellant's explanation that there was no procedure to document the incident he claims to have witnessed as a security guard. It considered that it is asking a lot to believe that a company that specializes in security does not have a post-incident procedure as part of its responsibilities, and it made a finding with regard to the male appellant's credibility.\n[28] The male appellant's memorandum submits that the documentary evidence submitted (Exhibit P-15) demonstrates that security firms, such as the one the male appellant worked for, are lax and lack organization and professionalism. The lack of training is a concrete example. It states that demonstrating this makes the lack of procedure for security incidents more than plausible.\n[29] The reality the male appellant faced during his work should be considered. The lack of procedures, training or structure beyond just being provided with a uniform is not out of the ordinary in Honduras. It is erroneous to find that the male appellant lacks credibility based solely on this information.\n[30] The male appellant stated that after being intimidated by the presence of individuals outside of his home after the first incident, he moved to another neighbourhood that is controlled by another gang. He explained that the shots were fired by a gang member who was in conflict with the gang controlling the new neighbourhood he had moved to.\n[31] The RPD concluded that the male appellant was speculating about the identity of the shooter in the attack on July 15, 2015, particularly about his membership in the gang that allegedly committed the robbery he had witnessed one month earlier. The memorandum submits that this was a drastic conclusion about the male appellant's reasoning, which is based on the fact that he was alone when the three shots were fired in his direction.\n[32] The RPD was correct in its conclusion regarding the male appellant's explanations concerning the shooter's identity. First, the male appellant was 45 minutes away from the location where the gang had targeted him and in an area controlled by another gang. Second, the male appellant acknowledged that the attack may have been intended to target any inhabitant of the enemy territory. Last, the male appellant himself was never able to see the shooter, which only allows for making assumptions and giving him the intentions he may have wanted to give him.\n[33] The male appellant's memorandum also makes speculative arguments about the possibility of him being located by members that have infiltrated an enemy gang. This constitutes conjecture, which is not supported by the information on the record.\nSensible nature of the explanations for behaviour that was described as inconsistent\n[34] The RPD drew a negative inference undermining the male appellant's credibility when it noted that despite the events he claims occurred in June and July 2015, he remained in Honduras until XXXX 2017. Moreover, it pointed out that two years passed without any incidents or harassment.\n[35] The male appellant's memorandum submits that the behaviour can be explained by a purely financial reason-the cost of making such a trip to Canada.\n[36] The RPD noted that when confronted with the issue of the delay in leaving, the male appellant testified that he had not planned to leave until the opportunity to come to Canada arose. It was therefore this opportunity that led to his departure, not a fear for his life. The RPD's conclusion regarding the male appellant's fear is correct and is consistent with his behaviour.\n[37] A distinction must be made between the events that, on a balance of probabilities, took place and their alleged links. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities:\n- the male appellant worked as a XXXX XXXX and witnessed a robbery;\n- gang members attempted to intimidate him by choosing to stop in front of his home two weeks later;\n- he was targeted by a member of an opposing gang while on enemy territory; and\n- his wife and her mother were extorted by the criminal gang that controls their neighbourhood.\n[38] However, there is no reason to conclude, as the male appellant claims, that each event is linked to the first incident. This is especially true since the reported incidents were spaced out over time and occurred in locations that are far from one another. Other than assumptions, there is no information leading to the conclusion, on a balance of probabilities, that the events, each of which falls under the context of crime in Honduras, resulted from one another.\n[39] Last, there is reason to consider that the male appellant's own behaviour and testimony confirmed that his fear for his life was not a factor until he seized the opportunity to come and work in Canada.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the determination of the RPD that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMe Richard Sheitoyan\nMe Richard Sheitoyan\nJanuary 27, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

I also conclude that the RPD did not err as you allege (III).\n[5] In light of these conclusions, your appeal is dismissed.\nI. EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n[6] As part of your appeal, you submitted your sworn statement5 and a letter from an immigration officer.6\nA. Your arguments about the admissibility of these two documents\n[7] The Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules) provide that the appellant must submit a memorandum that includes full and detailed submissions regarding how the documentary evidence that they want to cite on appeal meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and how that evidence relates to the appellant.7\n[8] In your memorandum, you submit that your sworn statement is necessary to understand what happened during the hearing, including the fact that it misled you by distorting your statements. You also submit that you could not raise these facts until you received the RPD's decision and the transcript of the hearing and that, furthermore, these facts explain why you had so much difficulty testifying during this hearing.8\n[9] With respect to the immigration officer's letter, you submit that you expected the RPD to be in possession of this document, but that you realized when you read its decision that it did not accept your argument that the immigration officer had not adequately disclosed your political history in Togo. You also state that this government employee who was directly involved in your refugee protection claim process was required to turn over all information collected to the RPD, which he did not do. Lastly, you state that you should not be held responsible for the immigration officer's mistake.9\nB. My analysis of your documents\n[10] These documents are not admissible. The reasons are as follows.\n[11] As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Singh, there is no doubt that the explicit conditions set out in subsection 110(4) have to be met and leave no room for discretion on the part of the RAD, meaning that only the following evidence is admissible:\n- Evidence that arose after the rejection of the claim;\n- Evidence that was not reasonably available; or\n- Evidence that was reasonably available, but that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection.10\nYour sworn statement does not relate to events that arose after the rejection of your claim\n[12] I read your sworn statement dated November 10, 2021. Based on my analysis of your statement, it does not contain any events that arose after the rejection of your refugee protection claim. In fact, it supports your arguments about the mistakes the RPD allegedly made in rejecting your refugee protection claim. I will take this into account when I analyze your arguments on this subject, which are included in your memorandum. That being said, your sworn statement is not new evidence within the meaning of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\nThe immigration officer's letter is part of the Refugee Protection Division record\n[13] I went through the documents that are part of the RPD record, where I found the letter from the immigration officer.11 It is therefore clear that this letter is not new evidence within the meaning of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\nII. ORAL HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[14] Under the RAD Rules, an appellant is required to submit a memorandum that includes full and detailed submissions regarding why the RAD should hold an oral hearing.12\n[15] In your written statement, you request an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA and that French be the language of the hearing with an Ewe interpreter present.13 In your memorandum, you do not make any full and detailed submissions as to why this oral hearing should be held.14\n[16] The onus rests on the RAD to determine whether the criteria set out in subsection 110(6) have been met.15 This subsection makes holding an oral hearing before the RAD subject to three conditions regarding the existence of new documentary evidence.16 I consider that your sworn statement and the letter from the immigration officer do not constitute new evidence. Consequently, an oral hearing cannot be held.17\nIII. ANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\n[17] The role of the RAD is not to conduct a de novo consideration of a claim for refugee protection, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.18 I have conducted an analysis of your record in order to respond to the central issues raised by your appeal,19 including by listening to the recording of the RPD hearing20 and reading the documentary evidence. I find that the correctness standard must be applied.21\nA. The errors you allege the Refugee Protection Division made\n[18] Under the RAD Rules, the person who is the subject of an appeal must state: (i) the errors that are the grounds of the appeal, and (ii) where the errors are located in the RPD's decision or in the transcript or in any recording of the hearing.22\n[19] In your memorandum, you identify the issue as whether the RPD made determinative errors regarding your credibility and the weight to be given to the evidence filed in support of your refugee protection claim.23 In your opinion, the RPD made several fatal errors:\n- at paragraph 4 of its decision by considering the date of XXXX XXXX, 2018, rather than XXXX XXXX, 2017, and concluding that this information was one of your allegations;24\n- at paragraph 15 of its decision, concluding that it was unreasonable for you not to have read the immigration forms thoroughly before signing them;25\n- at paragraphs 17 and 21 of its decision by misrepresenting what you stated about the date you started staying with Mr. XXXX;26\n- at paragraph 22 of its decision by upholding the conclusion based on misleading you;27\n- at paragraph 23 of its decision by not considering all of your testimony regarding the history of the facts and events experienced in Togo from XXXX XXXX, 2017 to XXXX XXXX, 2019;28\n- at paragraph 25 of its decision by failing to refer to your testimony and concluding that you had not provided an explanation;29\n- at paragraph 25 of its decision by concluding that you testified at the beginning of the hearing that you went into hiding after the XXXX XXXX, 2018, protest and by not considering that you interrupted your stay at Mr. XXXX home by going to visit your family;30\n- at paragraph 27 of its decision by failing to consider a part of your testimony that you received an initial summons in XXXX 2018 and by retaining only the part of your testimony given after the RPD misled you;31\n- at paragraph 28 of its decision by misleading you when it told you that your problems began in XXXX 2018 rather than XXXX 2017;32\n- at paragraph 29 of its decision by misrepresenting your statements when it concluded that your written account states that you received the summonses after going into hiding in the bush in XXXX 2018, which is not supported by the evidence on the record;33\n- at paragraph 35 of its decision by failing to give weight to exhibits C-1 to C-8 on the basis of the erroneous inferences invoked above and by concluding that you were not at risk of persecution in Togo for political reasons since there were many opposition political parties in that country.34\nB. The Refugee Protection Division's decision\n[20] In its decision, the RPD summarized your allegations and stated your history in Canada prior to claiming refugee protection;35 identified omissions, inconsistencies and a contradiction; and concluded that you had not demonstrated that your problems in your country were related to the Refugee Convention, nor that you were personally at risk of mistreatment within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.36\n[21] Its reasoning is, in summary, as follows:\n- you failed to declare on an immigration form that you were a member of the PNP party and your explanations on this topic were unreasonable;37\n- you failed to declare on an immigration form that you lived for seven to eight months with XXXX, after hiding in the bush for about 20 days following the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, protest and your explanations on this topic were unreasonable;38\n- you contradicted yourself with regard to the dates you allegedly went into hiding at XXXX house and your testimony also contradicts Exhibit C-4;39\n- you were not consistent about the dates when the summonses were sent to you and your explanations on this topic were unreasonable;40\n- you omitted to include in your written account that some time before leaving your country, you held a political meeting with young people and that the police intervened to stop this meeting, and your explanations on this topic were unreasonable;41\n- given the previously identified credibility issues, the RPD did not believe that you had demonstrated the truth of your allegations;42\n- given these same credibility issues, the RPD gave no weight to exhibits C-1 through C-6 and added that the fact that you produced exhibits C-1 through C-5 did not mean that you would be persecuted for your political opinion if you returned to Togo, given the existence of many opposition political parties in that country.43\nC. The Refugee Protection Division did not err as you allege\n[22] I listened to the RPD hearing, read your arguments and read the RPD decision. In my opinion, it did not err in finding that your credibility was undermined by omissions, inconsistencies and a contradiction. The reasons are as follows.\n[23] When refugee protection claimants swear to the truth of certain allegations, they are presumed to be telling the truth. However, this presumption is rebuttable where the evidence is inconsistent with the testimony or where the RPD is unsatisfied with the explanation provided for those inconsistencies. Even though they may be insufficient when taken individually or in isolation, the accumulation of contradictions, inconsistencies and omissions regarding crucial elements of a refugee protection claim can support a negative finding about its credibility.44 It is the entirety of the evidence that must be assessed.45 An accumulation of contradictions and omissions can be fatal to a refugee protection claimant's credibility.46\nThe Refugee Protection Division was attentive to all your testimony\n[24] Your arguments that the RPD misled you, distorted your words and ignored part of your testimony and your explanations, in my opinion, are not well founded. Rather, the RPD exhibited a consistent attitude of courtesy during your testimony, allowing you to explain what it perceived to be an omission, inconsistency or contradiction. Not to mention that in its decision, it specifically referred to your explanations, while finding them unreasonable.47\n[25] With respect to when you were allegedly gassed during a demonstration, as well as when you began to stay at Mr. XXXX home, it was actually you who changed your testimony during the hearing. In this regard, RPD never intended to mislead you, when at one point it asked you a question with reference to the date of XXXX XXXX, 2018.48 It is true that you had previously referred to the date of XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, as the date you decided to leave your country, because you were seriously gassed during a march.49 That said, in your Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), when you write about the XXXX XXXX protests, it is impossible to make out the year.50 Not to mention that, in his letter, Mr. XXXX specifically writes that he took you in after the XXXX XXXX, 2018, protests.51\n[26] In any event, during the hearing, the RPD was attentive to both of your versions on this matter, either that the date of the demonstration where you were allegedly gassed and after which you went to hide at Mr. XXXX home, was XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, or that it was XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. The RPD also invited you to explain the contradictions or inconsistencies that arose from the choice of either of these dates.52\n[27] As for the version you present as the correct one on appeal, the one dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, during the hearing, the RPD asked you to then explain why, in his letter, Mr. XXXX writes that he took you in after the protests on XXXX XXXX, 2018. Your response was that when you were going back and forth between there and your home, perhaps Mr. XXXX had not considered the date you were with him.53 Based on my own analysis of your record, this explanation is not acceptable, given that in his letter, Mr. XXXX writes that he took you in after the protests on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\n[28] Based on the version that it was as of XXXX XXXX, 2017, that you began living at Mr. XXXX home, the RPD also asked you to explain your testimony that you lived in hiding at his home for six to seven months, if you came out of hiding after the XXXX 2019 local elections. Your response was first that there had been a miscalculation, and then that you went back and forth between your home and Mr. XXXX home.54 Based on my own analysis of your record, this explanation is not acceptable either, given that between XXXX XXXX, 2017 and XXXX XXXX, 2019, is approximately 18 months. The difference between having lived six to seven months and having lived 18 months with Mr. XXXX, even accepting that you may have gone home twice, is still too great.\n[29] Not to mention that on the IMM 5669 form, you fail to declare that you stayed at his home.55 During the hearing, the RPD asked you about this omission. You answered first that you gave your parents' address when you were in elementary school, second that you did not pay attention to this, and third that you were somewhat depressed when you were gassed and did not take this into consideration.56 In my opinion, these explanations are not acceptable, nor is your argument that it was reasonable for you not to have read the form properly before signing it. Based on my own analysis of your record, your explanations and argument are at odds with the statement you made when you signed this form, namely, that you understood that giving a false statement by providing false or misleading information is an offence under section 127 of the IRPA.\nYou contradicted yourself about your summonses\n[30] In addition, during your testimony, you contradicted yourself about the dates of your summonses. You first stated that in XXXX 2019, when you first visited your family during the time you were living in hiding, your wife presented you with a summons dated XXXX XXXX, 2019. The RPD asked you to specify when the summonses were sent to you. You responded that they sent the first notice on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the second on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the third on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, and the fourth on XXXX XXXX, 2019. The RPD confronted you with the summonses you submitted in evidence (C-6), which in turn were dated XXXX XXXX, 2018, XXXX XXXX, 2018, and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.57 You then changed your testimony and stated that the summonses were from 2018.58\n[31] The RPD also asked you to explain why, in your written account, you write that after the XXXX 2018 and XXXX 2019 elections, you returned home and resumed your professional and political activities and received a second and then a third summons,59 if you had already received multiple summonses in XXXX 2018. You replied that these summonses were left for you at the house.60 Based on my own analysis of your record, your explanation is not acceptable, given that, even assuming they were left at your home, they were not the second and third summonses, but rather the sixth and seventh summonses.\n[32] The RPD also asked you to explain that you were not bothered by the authorities between your return home after the XXXX 2019 elections and your departure from Togo on XXXX XXXX, 2019. You answered that you were bothered by police officers who forbade you from holding a meeting with some young people. The RPD then asked you to explain why you do not include this information in your BOC Form. You replied that it was just a ban and that was why you did not put it in your written account.61 In my opinion, this explanation is not acceptable, given that at the beginning of the hearing you stated that all the information included in your BOC Form was complete, up to date and true, and that there was nothing to add.62\nThe Refugee Protection Division could give no weight to your documentary evidence\n[33] As for the documents that you submitted into evidence, the RPD gave them no weight and, in my opinion, it did not err. Once the RPD has found that a refugee protection claimant is not credible, it is then reasonable to have credibility concerns with the supporting documentary evidence.63 The weight of evidence is the persuasiveness of some evidence in comparison with other evidence.64\n[34] As for the summonses that you submitted into evidence, even if they are presumed genuine since they come from the authorities of your country,65 they do not, in my opinion, establish that you were wanted because of your political activities. They simply state that you were summoned for the purposes of a judicial or administrative investigation, without any details being provided as to the nature of this investigation.66 Moreover, during your testimony before the RPD, you never stated that you had any problems because of these summonses from the moment you returned home and resumed your professional and political activities until the moment you left your country.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] For these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely, that you failed to establish that you have a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA or that, on a balance of probabilities, you would be subjected to a risk within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA if you were to return to Togo.\n[36] Your appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nAlain Bissonnette\nAlain Bissonnette\nJanuary 21, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Your Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) is reproduced at pages 14 to 25; the documents you submitted into evidence before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) are reproduced at pages 69 to 85; and the list of documents admitted into evidence is reproduced at page 26 of the scanned version of the RPD record.\n2 RPD Reasons and Decision, September 10, 2021, pages 5 to 13 of the scanned version of the RPD record.\n3 Your written statement, page 13 of the scanned version of your appeal record.\n4 Your memorandum, pages 47 to 65 of the scanned version of your appeal record.\n5 Your sworn statement is reproduced at pages 43, 44 and 45 of the scanned version of your appeal record.\n6 This letter is reproduced at page 46 of the scanned version of your appeal record.\n7 Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules), SOR\/2012-257, subparagraph 3(3)(g)(iii).\n8 Your memorandum, supra, endnote 4, paragraphs 37 to 43.\n9 Ibid., paragraphs 44 to 51.\n10 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Appellant's alleged fear of persecution is based on membership in a particular social group, namely gender (women).\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellant's claim based on credibility.\n[5] The Appellant appeals this decision, asking that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) dismiss the RPD's decision.1 The Appellant does not submit new evidence on appeal, nor does she request an oral hearing.\n[6] The Appellant submits that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) erred in assessing credibility and failing to adhere to Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB.\n[7] The determinative issue on appeal is credibility.\n[8] After an independent review of the record, including listening to the audio-recording and reading the transcript of hearing before the RPD on September 13, 2022, analyzing all of the evidence and considering all of the Appellant's arguments, I find that the RPD's decision is correct. On a balance of probabilities, the Appellant has failed to provide sufficient, credible or trustworthy evidence to establish her claim.\nDECISION\n[9] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[10] The Appellant met her ex-partner, XXXX XXXX, a Nigerian police officer, on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The began cohabitation in September 2015, after the Appellant became pregnant. On January 3, 2016, the Appellant learned that XXXX already had two wives and two sons with one of these wives. After confronting him regarding these marriages, he threatened to beat the Appellant and revealed he was a member of the XXXX XXXX. XXXX revealed himself to be a controlling individual, forbidding the Appellant from visiting her family and friends and also forbidding her to leave the house while he was at work. During the period of cohabitation he sexually, physically and emotionally abused the Appellant.\n[11] On XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX beat the Appellant because he found her talking to neighbours. Thereafter, the Appellant was fearful for her unborn child since experienced bleeding and upon returning from a clinic she called the police. When the police arrived, they saw XXXX and stated it was a domestic issue and that the Appellant should be respectful to her partner. The Appellant's son was born on XXXX XXXX, 2016. A week later the Appellant moved to her parents' house but on XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX, accompanied by fellow police colleagues, visited the house of the Appellant's parents and forced her to return to his house.\n[12] After XXXX gave her little money to care for her son, the Appellant decided, in XXXX 2016, to return to work but XXXX threatened to kill her if she did return to work. The Appellant returned to her former place of employment on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The Appellant arranged for her son to be taken care of and proceeded to work and then home at the end of her day after retrieving her son. XXXX arrived home before the Appellant and as she was entering the house, with her son swaddled on her back, XXXX began to beat the Appellant. During the attack, the Appellant's son was also hit and his ribs were broken. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the Appellant's son died as a result of complications from his injuries. The Appellant moved back to her parents' residence and in XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, XXXX began to forcefully demand she return to their home and created a scene when she refused, including issuing a death threat. Police spoke with XXXX but he was not arrested. Following this incident, the Appellant was harassed by an unknown group of men and her parents' house was attacked twice. XXXX continued his death threats and the Appellant's mother sought help from their pastor. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the Appellant went to live at the church. The pastor introduced the Appellant to a travel agent, Mr. XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, Mr. XXXX and the Appellant left Benin City for Lagos, where the Appellant remained until XXXX XXXX, 2017, when she departed Nigeria for the United States of America. The Appellant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and subsequently made a refugee protection claim.\nANALYSIS\n[13] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2\nThe RPD did not err in relation to Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB\n[14] I will first address arguments related to Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB (Guideline 8) before assessing additional arguments made by the Appellant's Counsel on appeal. Counsel argues the RPD erred by failing to:\na. Evaluate the Appellant's vulnerability at the beginning of the hearing on September 13, 2022; 3\nb. Consider her vulnerability \"in the context of the analysis of her testimony and general credibility;\"4 and\nc. Take into consideration the Appellant's personal circumstances when analyzing her testimony after she told the RPD she was confused and was unable to \"place certain things in her mind.5\n[15] In support, Counsel notes the submission of letters from Dr. XXXX, at the \"Clinique des demandeurs d'asile et des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\" (CDAR) and R\u00e9seau d'intervention aupr\u00e8s des personnes ayant subi la violence organis\u00e9e (RIVO). Counsel references the diagnosis provided in the letter from Dr. XXXX at the CDAR indicating the Appellant has XXXX XXXX and that difficulties in XXXX XXXX XXXX are resulting symptoms.6 Counsel contends the letter states \"the appellant should be recognized as a vulnerable person with all that entails.\"7\n[16] The letter submitted by Dr. XXXX does not state \"the appellant should be recognized as a vulnerable person with all that entails,\" as argued by Counsel but that the RPD \"consider Ms. XXXX XXXX a vulnerable person and that you do everything possible to put her at ease as much as possible during the evaluation of her case.\"8 The letter does not suggest the Appellant would be severely impaired in testifying but asks the RPD to be cognizant of possible difficulties and to accommodate her as much as possible. The RPD took into consideration the stresses inherent in testifying by suggesting at the outset of the hearing that the Appellant could request a break at any time.9 The RPD initiated four breaks during the hearing after the Appellant expressed confusion regarding inconsistencies presented to her.10 I find the RPD accommodated the Appellant with breaks to provide her with an opportunity to collect herself to present her case upon resumption of the hearing. I find the RPD attempted to put the Appellant at ease by instructing her that she could request a break at any time and by breaking from the proceedings four times. In conducting the hearing and provided breaks, the RPD respected the Appellant's right to be heard. It is worth noting that Dr. XXXX suggests the RPD \"consider Ms. XXXX XXXX a vulnerable person,\" but there is no indication this suggestion was referencing the Guideline 8 definition of \"vulnerable.\" In the context of the refugee determination process, it is the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada's purview, and in this case the RPD, to decide what constitutes Guideline 8 vulnerability, rather than the doctor's reference to consideration of vulnerability.\n[17] Counsel argues, even though the Appellant did not apply to be identified as a vulnerable person, that the RPD erred in relation to Guideline 8 because it specifies, \"The IRB may also act on its own initiative\"11 but the RPD did not do so. I disagree with Counsel for the reasons that follow.\n[18] Guideline 8 informs any proceeding before the IRB to ensure that vulnerable persons are properly accommodated. Guideline 8 is published, available to Counsel and all persons appearing before the IRB and intended to apply to individuals whose ability to present their case before the IRB is \"severely impaired.\"12 Guideline 8 delineates that counsel for a person who may be considered vulnerable is expected to bring the vulnerability to the attention of the IRB as soon as possible and must make an application under the rules of the Refugee Protection Division.13 No application to have the Appellant designated as a vulnerable person was submitted to the RPD. An application would have notified the RPD to consider whether the Appellant was severely impaired in presenting her case. Guideline 8 states the RPD \"may act on its own initiative\" to designate a claimant as vulnerable. This provides the RPD with discretion and in this particular case the RPD did not deem the designation necessary. In the absence of an application or objection at the outset of the hearing to have the Appellant designated as vulnerable, I do not find the RPD erred in exercising its discretion and proceeding with the hearing without the Appellant being designated as vulnerable.\n[19] The RPD found the Appellant was \"confused during the hearing, but the confusion was due to the inconsistencies that arose in the testimony of the claimant during the hearing.\"14 I agree with the RPD and find the Appellant provided inconsistent and evolving testimony15 as opposed to an inability to remember, on a balance of probabilities. The Appellant was unable to consistently articulate the essential elements of her claim. I have considered the possibility that this was due to trauma, depression, or memory or concentration problems. However, the following aspects of the testimony lead me to believe that any form of trauma is not the cause of the inconsistencies, on a balance of probabilities.\n[20] At the hearing, the Appellant first testified that during the assault by XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017, that her son \"was unfortunately hit by one of his punches\" and that they rushed him to the hospital after she \"quickly bring -- brought him out from my back. I carried him in my arm.\"16 The RPD stated that the medical report indicates that her son fell from her back, and the Appellant reiterated that the baby was struck by XXXX.17 The RPD again mentioned that the medical report indicated her son fell from her back and the Appellant then testified, \"So, I mean, it was when -- when he was hitting and punching me and all that, that was when the impact went to the baby. He blew the baby, and the baby fell from my back, you know.\"18 I do not find it credible that the Appellant would fail to recall whether her son fell from her back, until prompted by the RPD. She stated specifically that after her son was hit that she \"brought him out from my back\" rather than collecting him from the ground. The RPD asked the Appellant why she did not mention that her son fell from her back and the Appellant responded, \"I don't know. I mean, I thought that was going to be the same implication of what I said before.\"19 If her allegations were true, I find she would have recalled picking her son up from the floor rather than transferring him to her back, on a balance of probabilities. Furthermore, I reject the argument that the inconsistencies were due to trauma since she was reminded by the RPD that the medical report stated her son fell from her back and repeated that her son was struck without mentioning the fall. She attempted to correct her testimony by stating she did not mention the fall because she thought it was the same implication. I draw a negative credibility inference regarding the Appellant's inconsistent and evolving testimony concerning the cause of her son's death because her son being struck and the Appellant transferring him from her back does not present the same implication as her son being struck, falling and being picked-up before being taken to the hospital. Therefore, I give no weight to her oral testimony concerning the incident alleged to have occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2017. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant's emotional response to questions posed by the RPD and expressed confusion arose because of her inability to explain inconsistencies in her testimony rather than as an extension of any trauma.\n[21] As well, on XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX allegedly beat the Appellant because he found her talking to neighbours. The RPD asked the Appellant on three occasions if this event happened, as alleged, around midnight and the Appellant responded in two instances, \"Yes,\"20 and in the third response stated, \"It was around 12:00 that that happened.\"21 The Appellant then testified that she went to the hospital immediately following the incident at midnight.22 The RPD questioned the Appellant regarding the medical report related to this incident since it states she was admitted after arriving at 19:15. The Appellant then stated, \"There is one that we went at midnight\"23 and then attempted to clarify with \"There was one that I was pregnant -- previous pregnant before...\"24 before asserting that she \"just forgot everything.\"25 The RPD recessed the hearing given the Appellant's confusion. Upon resumption of the hearing, the Appellant testified,\nI don't know what happened with the mix-up with the doctor's diagnosis, because it wasn't, like, 7:00 p.m. That is all wrong. Because that wasn't the right time it happened. So, everything now is kind of confusing because I don't know what to say because that's the wrong information.26\nI reject this explanation as the medical report, in addition to stating the Appellant arrived at 7:15, also states, \"Patient was discharged home in satisfactory condition on the XXXX XXXX. 2016.\" The medical report indicates the Appellant arrived at 19:15 and was discharged later that evening and still on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The Appellant was direct in asserting on multiple occasions that the incident happened at approximately midnight and that she proceeded to the hospital immediately thereafter. On a balance of probabilities, I find the Appellant's confusion is not a result of a memory issue, given her emphatic assertions that she proceeded to the hospital, but an inability to recount with accuracy a central allegation of her claim. Furthermore, the Appellant states in her narrative that she returned home on the same day from the hospital27 but testified she remained in the hospital for two days following her admission. She testified, \"It's two -- two days that they gave me drip because I was -- the bleeding did not just stop automatically. It's two days. I don't know what is going on. I'm confused, tired.\"28 I find the Appellant's testimony to be inconsistent with her narrative and the information presented in the medical report. On a balance of probabilities, I do not attribute the confusion she expresses in testimony to be a failure of her memory due to past trauma since she testified to facts that did not align with her narrative and the medical report, as opposed to being unable to recall events. Therefore, I give no weight to her oral testimony concerning the incident alleged to have occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I do not find the RPD erred in relation to Guideline 8.\nThe RPD did not err in assessing credibility\nThe RPD erred in assessing the supporting letters\n[22] Counsel argues the RPD erred by assigning no weight to the letters provided by the Appellant's pastor, sister and former employer because they were submitted without identification for the signatories. Counsel is correct as the RPD did find the letters were submitted without identification, but the RPD did not limit its weight assignment to a lack of identification. I find Lawani29 instructive with respect to the letters. In Lawani, the Federal Court found \"a lack of credibility concerning central elements of a refugee protection claim can extend and trickle down to other elements of the claim30 and be generalized to all of the documentary evidence presented to corroborate a version of the facts.\" And, \"Similarly, 31 it is open to the RPD not to give evidentiary weight to assessments or reports based on underlying elements found not be credible.\"\n[23] The letter submitted by the Appellant's pastor was assigned no weight because the Appellant was unable to provide the name of the church and explained it was because the church was her mother's rather than her own.32 The RPD did not accept this explanation since the church allegedly provided her with shelter and raised money for her to come to Canada.33 The RPD also noted that the letter is undated, in addition to not being accompanied by identification. I find the RPD erred in assigning no weight to the letter because the Appellant did not know the name of the church. While one would expect the Appellant to know the name of the church, given the pastor's significance, the church's role in assisting her by providing safe haven, introducing her to a travel agent that facilitated travel to Canada and raising funds to assist with that travel, I do not find her inability to recall or to know the name of the church to be sufficient to assign no weight to the letter. However, I do not find this fatal to the RPD's decision since the letter does not present information that resolves the credibility concerns the RPD found in relation to the central allegations of the Appellant's claim.\n[24] I assign little weight to the letter because the pastor did not indicate he had first-hand knowledge of the allegations that led the Appellant to seek refuge in the church and the letter does not convey information related to the central allegations of the claim from a first-hand perspective. The letter indicates the Appellant sought refuge in the church and that he and the church assisted the Appellant. I do not find these statements overcome the inconsistencies in the Appellant's testimony concerning the events of XXXX XXXX, 2016, and XXXX XXXX, 2017, discussed previously. The letter of support is based on self-reporting by the Appellant to the pastor and the letter is not sufficient in establishing her claim, on a balance of probabilities.\n[25] The RPD noted that the letters from the Appellant's sister and former employer were not \"certified\" and were \"were presented without any identification of the signatories.\"34 The RPD also references the credibility concerns it had previously discussed in not assigning any weight to these letters.35 The RPD's decision would have benefitted from a reiteration of those credibly concerns. I find the RPD erred in assigning the letters no weight since the letters contain information that corroborates aspects of the Appellant's claim. However, I do not find it fatal to the RPD's decision since neither of the letters overcomes the inconsistencies related to events central to the Appellant's claim.\n[26] The letter from the Appellant's sister indicates that the Appellant's son was assaulted and that resulting complications caused his death.36 While the letter from the Appellant's sister describes the Appellant's son experiencing an assault with complications resulting in his death, this information was imparted by the Appellant to her sister since her sister was not present at the time of the incident. The RPD impugned the Appellant's credibility concerning the events that allegedly led to her son's death because of inconsistencies between the Appellant's narrative and testimony concerning how the injuries leading to his death occurred.37 The Appellant provided inconsistent and evolving testimony when confronted with how her son died. I do not find the RPD erred in relation to this content in the letter. Since the letter indicates XXXX used his position as a police officer to intimidate the family,38 this corroborates the Appellant's allegation in her narrative that XXXX \"oppressed and threatened my family members.\"39 I find this to be first-hand knowledge of XXXX's actions since the Appellant's sister is a family member. However, this information does not overcome the RPD's credibility concerns, nor mine, in relation to the central allegations of the claim. The letter has little probative value in establishing the central allegations of the Appellant's claim and thus I sign the letter little weight.\n[27] The letter from the Appellant's former employer also states that her son was assaulted, which resulted in his death.40 The Appellant's former employer does not have first-hand knowledge of the assault and cause of death and this information was based on information imparted to him. He states, \"I was also informed of how often XXXX XXXX beat her up incessantly and the unfortunate incidence of the baby's assault which led to the baby's death.\"41 The letter does indicate that the Appellant was an apprentice seamstress and that he introduced the Appellant to XXXX, which corroborates the Appellant's assertions in her narrative.42 As such, I assign little weight to the letter. I do not find the RPD's error, in assigning no weight to the letter, fatal to its decision since the letter does not overcome the credibility concerns related to the central allegations of the claim.\n[28] I do not find the RPD erred \"by not evaluating the documentary evidence independently from the appellant's testimony.\"43 Lawani instructs that a lack of credibility concerning central allegations of the claim can \"trickle down\" to other aspects of the claim, including the documentary evidence. Having found the Appellant lacked credibility concerning central elements of her claim, I do not find the RPD erred in evaluating the documentary evidence relaying information it found to lack credibility, especially since the information was self-reported to the authors by the Appellant.\n[29] Counsel argues the RPD erred by negating the weight of the medical certificate44 concerning the death of the Appellant's son because it did not describe the attack and was not certified. Counsel contends the certificate corroborates the Appellant's testimony concerning the cause of her son's death and the RPD erred by not considering this corroboration of the Appellant's fears. As previously indicated, the RPD impugned the Appellant's testimony concerning the events surrounding her son's death. As such the RPD was correct in assigning little weight to the certificate since the certificate does not corroborate the events leading to the death but describes injuries causing death. The reason for her son's death is not in question. However, the Appellant's lack of credibility, through inconsistent and evolving testimony, concerning how those injuries were sustained, on a balance of probabilities. The certificate does not overcome the credibility concerns with respect to the events that led to the death of the Appellant's son, which is a central allegation of the claim. I do not find the RPD erred.\nThe RPD did not err in assessing available medical treatment\n[30] Counsel contends the RPD erred in concluding the Appellant would be able to access proper medical treatment in Nigeria because the documentary evidence \"states she could not.\"45 Counsel asserts the RPD referenced information from the National Documentation Package for Nigeria indicating \"several mental health professionals told Human Rights Watch that quality mental health services are available only to wealthier citizens who can afford it\"46 in support of this argument. I disagree because the cited passage is not explicit concerning what mental services are being referenced, no evidence has been tendered to suggest the Appellant would not be considered a wealthier citizen, and the extent or duration of treatment required is not indicated in the letter written47 by a psychosocial worker.\n[31] The documentary evidence indicates that people who live in urban areas of Nigeria receive four times as much access to healthcare as those living elsewhere48 with the Nigerian system divided into a private and public healthcare network.49 Evidence also indicates that \"there is no form of mental illness for which treatment is not available in Nigeria.\"50 It is unclear from the documentary evidence referenced what quality of mental health services only the wealthy can access because the Nigerian system is divided into private and public healthcare and that mental health services are readily available. The document does not specify what several mental health professionals meant by \"wealthier.\" The documentary evidence indicates 40.1% of the population of Nigeria lives below the poverty line.51 Also, the RPD noted the following in its decision,\nAccording to her BOC, the claimant speaks Edo and English, both languages are spoken in Benin City, and she is \"a XXXX XXXX with the status of apprenticeship\". She has 10 years of education and she has experience as a XXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada. Nothing shows that the claimant would be unable to find work in her field or another kind of work in Benin City.\nThe Appellant's level of education exceeds the national average of 9 years for females.52 When education is considered in conjunction with her language skills and work experience, including the specialized skills associated with XXXX XXXX, the Appellant is well-positioned for inclusion in the percentage of the population above the 40% who live below the poverty line and would thus be relatively \"wealthier,\" on a balance of probabilities. It is also worth noting that the psychosocial worker's letter does not indicate the duration of treatment required and whether it would be required in perpetuity. As such, I do not find the RPD erred and the documentary evidence does not state the Appellant, in her particular circumstances, could not access mental health services.\n[32] After an independent review of the record, including listening to the audio-recording and reading the transcript of hearing before the RPD on September 13, 2022, analyzing all of the evidence and considering all of the Appellant's arguments, I find that the RPD's decision is correct. On a balance of probabilities, the Appellant has failed to provide sufficient, credible or trustworthy evidence to establish her claim. As such, I find the RPD did not err in analyzing the Appellant's fear regarding her with respect to ongoing gender-based persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[33] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAaron Smith\nAaron David Smith\nMarch 11, 2022\nDate\n1 P-2, Appellant's record, Memorandum of Argument, at page 10, para. 27.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He claims that he is at risk of persecution by the authorities in his country because his father allegedly hired an individual who is considered to be a political opponent of President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's regime. In addition, because he has been living abroad since 2016, the appellant believes that he would be arrested upon his return to the country as a person suspected of being a political opponent of the regime. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) did not find credible the appellant's allegation that his father was arrested and has not been seen since. The RPD also did not find credible the allegation that the appellant's mother was threatened by militia reporting to the presidency and was now in hiding. According to the appellant, the RPD improperly assessed his credibility, having erred in its assessment of the evidence. He also criticizes it for failing to assess the risk he would be subjected to for having lived abroad for a lengthy period.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The appeal is dismissed. The RPD did not err in its assessment of the evidence, which contains major contradictions undermining the appellant's credibility with respect to key elements of the allegations concerning what happened to his parents. Therefore, it was not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he faces a serious possibility of persecution by reason of his family relationship to his parents. Furthermore, the evidence available does not support the conclusion that the appellant would be subjected to a risk for having lived abroad, on a balance of probabilities.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] According to the written account provided by the appellant in his Basis of Claim Form1 (BOC Form), his father had worked for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since 2001. He was part of the XXXX XXXX unit and oversaw the recruitment of new employees. In that capacity, in 2017, he allegedly hired an individual who was a close associate of a leader of a political organization that opposed the Congolese government. As a result of this, his employer suspended him from his duties. Then, in XXXX 2017, he was arrested at his home by militia reporting to the country's presidency. They also threatened the appellant's mother at the time. The family has not heard from the appellant's father since; his mother fled her home in Brazzaville and is in hiding at the home of family members in the southern part of the country, like both of the appellant's sisters.\n[4] At the time of those events, the appellant was living in Ghana, where he was attending university. The following month, in XXXX 2018, he left for Canada to pursue his studies at the Universit\u00e9 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [university XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX]. Up until then, he was unaware of everything that had happened to his parents, because his mother had not wanted to tell him. A friend who had spoken with his mother was the one who told him about it a few days after he arrived in Montr\u00e9al. He apparently told him that his mother [translation] \"had been subjected to humiliating treatment and serious threats by the gang of secret militia.\" That information is confirmed by the appellant's mother in a letter she addressed to him in May 2018 and in which he explains having been [translation] \"subjected to undue, cruel and humiliating treatment followed by serious death threats.\"2\n[5] The appellant filed his refugee protection claim in February 2018. In his BOC Form, he states that he abandoned his university studies because he no longer received financial support from his father. He states that his fear of returning to his country stems from the fact that he is his father's only son, which puts him at risk of being persecuted by the Congolese authorities. He also believes that he would be viewed with suspicion by the authorities because he has not lived in the Congo (Brazzaville) since 2016.\n[6] The RPD did not believe that the appellant's father was employed by the XXXX, because the appellant's visa application, filed in XXXX 2017, contains information contrary to this.3 In it he describes his father's occupation as that of a businessman,4 specifying that he has his own business.5 In addition, a letter from his father that accompanied the application states that he is neither a worker nor an employee, but rather [translation] \"a liberal man who manages his own affairs.\"6 Thus, the RPD concluded that the appellant's father had probably not been arrested. The RPD also concluded that it was not credible that the appellant's mother had fled her home in Brazzaville. The appellant's testimony in that regard was contradicted by information in his mother's letter drafted in May 2018 that she was in Brazzaville at that time. Her identity card, issued in September 2019, lists an address in Brazzaville.\n[7] Lastly, the RPD stated that the appellant's credibility was also undermined by the fact that he was unable to provide any information whatsoever about the individual that his father allegedly recruited in 2017 to work at the SNPC.\n[8] The appellant challenges the soundness of the RPD's assessment of the evidence presented. He argues that he did not mislead the panel about his father's occupation, stressing the fact that he had many jobs. In his view, he did not need to specify in his visa application that his father worked for the XXXX, because a visa officer's primary concern is to verify the financial sufficiency of the student visa applicant or his parents if they are supporting him financially, without necessarily focusing on each job held by the parents.\n[9] The appellant also challenges the RPD's conclusion that his mother had not left Brazzaville. He argues that the fact that \"Brazzaville\" was written next to the date in his mother's letter refers to the country. In addition, he is of the opinion that it was unfair to criticize him for being unable to explain why his mother's identity card lists an address in Brazzaville, because only she could know that.\n[10] Lastly, the appellant argues that the RPD erred in law by failing to assess whether he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to the Congo, whereby he would be a person in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act). The fact that he was the only member of the family to travel or study abroad could attract the attention of the Congolese authorities upon his arrival at the airport. He refers to documentary evidence indicating that Congolese nationals returning from trips abroad can be subjected to mistreatement on a totally arbitrary basis.\n[11] Seven weeks after filing his appeal memorandum, the appellant submitted other supporting documents. In an affidavit that is included in that documentation, he explains his delay in submitting new evidence by the fact that it was only in reviewing the RPD's decision that he realized that he should have provided other evidence addressing the panel's concerns. The appellant's new documentation corroborates his testimony concerning the job held by his father at the XXXX. He also submits two recent letters from his cousin and his mother addressing that issue. His mother's letter states that she mistakenly indicated Brazzaville as the location where she drafted her letter to the appellant in May 2018. She also explains that it was in June 2017 that she applied for her identity card, which was issued to her two years later giving her brother's address.\nADMISSIBILITY OF THE NEW EVIDENCE\n[12] I am not satisfied that the new evidence that the appellant wants to present meets the admissibility criteria established by the Act and the case law. I am of the opinion that the evidence would reasonably have been available to the appellant before the date of the RPD's decision. Thus, it is not part of the evidence allowed under subsection 110(4) of the Act.\n[13] I take into account the appellant's explanation for why he delayed providing the evidence and could not do so before the RPD. However, the explanation does not demonstrate that the evidence in question was not available, but rather that the appellant had not anticipated that he would need it. The appellant should have realized that his credibility would be an issue before the RPD, particularly with respect to the events surrounding his father's arrest and his mother's flight. He seems to have been blindsided by the fact that the RPD noted contradictions in the evidence in that regard, particularly when it addressed the content of his refugee protection claim, which indicates that his father's primary employment was not the one he alleges in his BOC Form. That was also the case when the RPD pointed out to him contradictions in the evidence concerning where his mother was living in 2018 and 2019.\n[14] No matter, these are not the types of circumstances that Parliament intended as the ones giving rise to the opportunity to present new evidence on appeal. The evidence that the appellant now wants to present was certainly available when he appeared before the RPD. However, he had not thought about it because he had not yet realized the contradictions in the evidence.\n[15] That said, I am also of the opinion that the new evidence does not meet one of the three admissibility criteria established by the case law,7 namely, credibility. The conditions in which the documentation in question was prepared seem rather suspicious to me, considering the late date on which it was obtained. I am not satisfied as to the genuineness of the documentation that is allegedly from the XXXX or the truthfulness of the statements of the appellant's cousin and mother, or even if those statements were actually made by them.\n[16] Thus, for those reasons, none of the new evidence presented by the appellant is admitted on appeal.\nANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\n[17] I conducted my own analysis of the documentary evidence on the RPD record, listened to the entire recording of the hearing and reviewed the partial transcript of the hearing provided by the appellant.8 I conclude that the RPD's decision contains no errors. The appellant's testimony is not credible because the contradictions between the evidence and key elements on the record rebut the presumption of the truthfulness of the testimony. Therefore, he did not establish a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his family relationship to his parents. Furthermore, he did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment merely because he has been living abroad for several years. The evidence he cites in the National Documentation Package (NDP) does not demonstrate this; the risk to which he would be subjected is rather generalized.\nIt is not credible that the appellant's father was employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[18] The RPD was correct in noting that the visa application that the appellant filed barely three months before he filed his BOC Form clearly gives the impression that his father never worked for the XXXX, thus making it inconceivable that he was arrested for recruiting an individual perceived to be a political opponent. I find illogical the explanation that it would not have been to the appellant's advantage to point out that his father held a managerial position in a state-owned company when he was trying to persuade the Canadian authorities that his family would be able to support him financially if he came to Canada to study. Instead, I note that the information provided in support of the visa application establishes that the appellant's father worked for himself.\n[19] The appellant suggested that his father held several different jobs. Although that is not inconceivable, it does not explain why he would have sought to hide an important role that he allegedly held at the XXXX. Both the appellant's description and that of his father in a letter accompanying the visa application instead seek to define his work as being outside of the context of the state. I am of the opinion that if the appellant's father had truly worked as a recruiter for the XXXX for 16 years, he would not have described himself as [translation] \"a liberal man who manages [his] own affairs.\"\n[20] In failing to establish that his father was employed in the field of XXXX XXXX with the XXXX in 2017, the appellant failed to demonstrate a basis for his fear of being persecuted by the Congolese authorities by reason of his father's conduct.\nIt is not credible that the appellant's mother feared being arrested or persecuted\n[21] The evidence presented contradicts the appellant's claim that his mother fled her home in Brazzaville in December 2017. In particular, I note that her May 2018 letter makes no mention of her having left Brazzaville.\nExpatriating himself does not create a personal risk or a serious possibility of persecution\n[22] The appellant cites a report from a non-governmental organization that provides an account of [translation] \"violence involving law enforcement, particularly the police\" and arbitrary detention,9 to which anyone on Congolese territory may be subjected. This has absolutely nothing to do with having lived abroad for a lengthy period, contrary to what the appellant argues.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] The presumption of the truthfulness of the appellant's testimony was rebutted by inconsistencies in the evidence. In addition, he did not demonstrate that he would likely be subjected to a personalized risk. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nPhilippe Rabot\nPhilippe Rabot\nApril 27, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 SPR-1, Refugee Protection Division (RPD) record, R of the appellant, pages 26-27.\n2 Ibid., Exhibit P-5: Statement of the appellant's mother, page 117.\n3 Ibid., RPD's reasons, pages 3 to 12.\n4 Ibid., Information on the family (form), page 95.\n5 Ibid., page 105.\n6 Ibid., page 83.\n7 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

During the XXXX 2016 protests in Bamenda, she fell and hurt her foot while attempting to flee the clashes in the city. She learned that her XXXX had been set on fire by criminals when she was on her first trip to Canada from XXXX 2017 to XXXX 2018. She lived in fear because of the actions of the Ambazonia militia operating in her region. She travelled with her husband to Canada again on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and to Italy on XXXX XXXX, 2019. In XXXX 2019, her husband returned to Cameroon because their son had been arrested and falsely accused of having ties to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX) [XXXX XXXX XXXX]. The appellant received no further news from Cameroon and, realizing that her life was in danger, she returned to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and claimed Canada's protection. The appellant also alleges that she would be subjected to a risk to her life because she is an ethnic Bamelike and a member of the particular social group of women who face gender-related violence.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected her claim for refugee protection. Although it accepted that the appellant's main allegations were true, it had concerns about some of her speculations and found that she did not establish that she would face a serious possibility of persecution by reason of her race or ethnicity, political opinion or membership in the particular social group of women if she were to return to Cameroon. The RPD was of the opinion that the appellant did not establish that she was being targeted for any particular reason, including her ethnicity, when her XXXX was set on fire. On the contrary, having considered all of the evidence, it appears that the arson was an act of indiscriminate violence, which was widespread in western Cameroon at the time. The RPD noted that the appellant and her family were not worried about anything during the seven months that she lived at her home in Yaound\u00e9 before leaving her country, which supports its conclusion that there is no prospective risk. The appellant did not establish that the assault against her husband, about which nothing is known, had any link to the other alleged acts of persecution. The appellant did not establish that the entire family is being targeted for supporting the XXXX, especially since her son, who was falsely accused, is the only member of a large family to have experienced problems related to politics. The single example of persecution of her family by reason of their ethnicity is an attack on her sister that occurred 25 years ago, which was never pursued and which the appellant did not even think was worth mentioning in her written account. It was an isolated and random incident, which does not establish that there is a serious possibility of persecution. In addition, the objective documentary evidence does not establish that the Bamileke are subjected to generalized persecution in Cameroon. At most it indicates that there are tensions between ethnic groups in Cameroon that are sometimes exploited for political reasons. Finally, the RPD noted that the Bamileke and related ethnic groups represent almost 40 percent of Cameroon's population. The RPD was of the opinion that the objective documentary evidence does not indicate a serious possibility of persecution for women in Cameroon based solely on their membership in the social group of women without another risk factor, such as forced marriage, sexual exploitation or female genital mutilation. The appellant's allegations do not refer to any of these factors and she did not argue to the contrary. For all these reasons, the appellant did not establish that there is a serious possibility of persecution if she were to return to Cameroon.\n[4] The appellant states before the Refugee Appeal Section (RAD) that the RPD erred in assessing and analyzing the evidence available in the National Documentation Package (NDP) by making a selective assessment of the evidence, drawing a negative inference based on the lack of information concerning the arrest of her son and his supposed political activities, and not considering an event that occurred 25 years ago. The RPD erred in drawing a negative inference from the appellant's testimony when it found that the prospective risk was the only determinative issue, thereby preventing existing doubts from being addressed and breaching the principle of natural justice and procedural fairness. The RPD erred in using the burden of proof required by section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) to grant refugee status.\n[5] The determinative issues in this case are credibility, prospective risk and procedural fairness.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in determining that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[7] My role is to examine the evidence in its entirety and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.1 In doing so, I considered the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Guideline 4).\nRequest for an oral hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division denied\n[8] The appellant did not submit any new evidence, but is nevertheless requesting that an oral hearing be held before the RAD. However, pursuant to subsection 110(6) of IRPA, I can only hold an oral hearing if there is new evidence that is found to be admissible, which is not the case here. For that reason, the request to hold an oral hearing before the RAD is denied.\nPrinciples of natural justice and procedural fairness not breached\n[9] The appellant submits that the RPD erred in drawing negative conclusions from her testimony when it identified the prospective risk as being the sole determinative issue, thus preventing existing doubts from being addressed and breaching the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[10] I consider it useful to address this matter first as issues of natural justice can sometimes vitiate the entirety of the evidence on the record.\n[11] I note that, in this case, the RPD did not identify prospective risk as the sole determinative issue. Although it did identify prospective risk and the internal flight alternative (IFA) as determinative issues at the start of the hearing, just before the appellant's counsel spoke, at about 1:29:00 of the hearing recording, the RPD advised counsel that the IFA would no longer be a determinative issue and that it was adding a new issue, that of credibility. In addition, counsel addressed certain credibility issues in the ensuing questions and in her submissions. I am of the opinion that the appellant had every opportunity to be heard on the credibility issues and that there was no breach of the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[12] I would add that stating that the determinative issue is prospective risk implicitly suggests that certain facts are credible, but not necessarily that the appellant's speculation is credible. The RPD clearly indicated which facts and speculation it did not find credible and its decision is perfectly intelligible and correct in that regard.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err by conducting a selective analysis of the evidence in the National Documentation Package\n[13] The appellant submits that the RPD erred in conducting a selective analysis of the evidence in the NDP.\n[14] Specifically, she notes that according to Tab 4.3 of the NDP, in 2019, the National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms documented 19 communal clashes, during which local groups throughout the country accused Bamilekes of being land grabbers despite the fact that they generally pay on a willing seller basis.\n[15] That is not how I read the evidence. First, the information about the 19 clashes is found in one of the document's footnotes, which indicates that these 19 clashes took place over a five-year period between 2014 and 2019, not in 2019 as claimed by the appellant.\n[16] Second, I am of the opinion that this information must be read in context. It is found in a section entitled \"E. Political Strains Turn Ethnic.\" The beginning of the section indicates that many people regard diversity as a safeguard against communal violence, and further on that politicians have attempted to discredit the XXXX by falsely accusing it of being almost exclusively the Bamileke party. Politicians fuel ethnic tensions with inflammatory speeches considered by many as a \"tool that politicians use during elections but that typically does not sour the overall climate of tolerance among ordinary people.\" The examples that follow, including the one cited by the appellant, are exceptions to this overall climate of tolerance, and the appellant has never been the target of purchased or [translation] \"stolen\" land.\n[17] I am of the opinion that the RPD clearly considered all of the evidence, including the excerpt quoted by the appellant, and correctly summarized and concluded, [translation] \"At the very most, there are indications that tensions between ethnic groups exist in Cameroon and are sometimes exploited for political reasons.\"\n[18] The appellant then cites a passage from the document found at Tab 2.7 of the NDP, which states that in XXXX 2018, a group of armed separatists entered a shop, accused the two shopkeepers of supporting the government and badly beat them. The chief of the separatists asked one of the shopkeepers if he was a Bamileke and, after the shopkeeper confirmed that he was, the chief stated that he was going to kill him, but then left after taking his money. The appellant notes that she and her husband were also XXXX. She also cites Tab 2.3 of the NDP, which indicates that discrimination against the Bamileke is common.\n[19] In my opinion, this evidence is not very relevant to the appellant's refugee protection claim. It describes the situation in southwestern Cameroon, the Anglophone region where ongoing conflicts between the separatists and the government are centred. Attacks on shopkeepers considered to be pro-government are commonplace in this area, no matter the shopkeepers' ethnicity. However, the appellant's XXXX was in Bamenda, in the northwestern part of the country, in a region that is more than a six-hour drive from the regions mentioned in this document, and there is no reason to suspect support for government forces. Furthermore, she and her family subsequently settled in Yaound\u00e9, in Centre Region, an Anglophone separatist region. The RPD did not err by failing to consider this evidence as not very relevant to the appellant's situation.\n[20] The evidence indicating that discrimination against the Bamileke is common does not provide examples of the type of discrimination that the Bamileke face other than the fact that they are excluded from positions of political influence. The appellant never indicated that she had political aspirations or experienced discrimination due to the absence of Bamileke in positions of influence. In any event, she did not establish the possibility in her case of cumulative acts of discrimination amounting to persecution. The RPD did not err by failing to consider this evidence.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err by drawing a negative inference from the lack of information about her son's arrest\n[21] The appellant submits that the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference from the lack of information about her son's arrest and his potential political activities. She essentially argues that the RPD did not apply Guideline 4 [translation] \"concerning vulnerable persons,\" which requires the RPD to be sensitive to the fact that women from certain cultures where men do not share the details of their political activities with their spouse\/mother\/daughter may find themselves in a difficult situation when questioned about the experiences of their male relatives.\n[22] I will begin by noting that the guideline referred to by the appellant is in fact Guideline 4 and not the Chairperson's Guideline 8: Procedures with Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB. The appellant was never identified as a vulnerable person and therefore Guideline 8 does not apply in this case.\n[23] I find that the appellant's argument is unsatisfactory because she never claimed that she was unable to clarify her son's political activities because of the cultural context or for any other reason. On the contrary, she categorically stated that he was never involved in politics.\n[24] Although the RPD stated in its decision that she was unable to specify when and for how long her son was detained the second time, the RPD did not draw a negative inference from this.\n[25] The appellant testified that she was never involved in any political activities and her son's arrest is the only reason why she believes that she is also a subject of the investigation opened by the authorities. Therefore, she is speculating when she states that she is also under investigation. I see no error here. I would add that even if an investigation was opened concerning her son and certain members of his family, there is nothing to suggest that the appellant is one of her son's family members being investigated. The mere fact that her son was arrested does not lead to this conclusion, on a balance of probabilities. The RPD did not err in that regard.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err by failing to consider the persecution faced by her family 25 years ago\n[26] The appellant submits that the RPD erred by not considering the persecution she experienced 25 years ago because past persecution can be the basis for current or future fear according to the case law. As for her failure to mention this event in her BOC Form, she cites paragraph 66 of the UNHCR Guide,2 which states that \"[o]ften the applicant himself may not be aware of the reasons for the persecution feared.\"\n[27] With respect, I do not agree with the appellant's interpretation of this paragraph, which must be read together with the one that follows it. This paragraph does not remove the burden on the appellant of stating and establishing the facts she alleges. The stated principle is that it is for the \"examiner,\" the RPD in this case, \"to ascertain the reason or reasons for the persecution feared and to decide whether the definition in the 1951 Convention is met with in this respect.\" I find, as the RPD correctly did, that the appellant's failure to include in her BOC Form the only example of persecution faced by her family because of their ethnicity, namely her sister's attack 25 years earlier, undermines her credibility, especially given that, in her view, this event contributes to her prospective fear.\n[28] I conclude, as did the RPD, that this incident is insufficient to establish more than a mere possibility of prospective persecution, as there was no follow-up on this attack in the ensuing 25 years.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not impose on the appellant the burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that her fear of persecution will materialize\n[29] The appellant submits that the RPD erred by requiring that she establish, on a balance of probabilities, that her fear of persecution would materialize by stating, in paragraph 17 of the decision, that [translation] \"the applicant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she was the target of arson for any reason, in particular her ethnicity.\"\n[30] That is not my understanding of this statement. It does not mention the prospective fear or the issue of whether it was established that the prospective fear would materialize. It only addresses a past event, the arson at the appellant's XXXX. The RPD did not err in that regard.\n[31] I agree with the RPD that in the context of the violent clashes that took place in her city at the time of the arson, and in the absence of witnesses or other indications that the appellant was targeted, the appellant did not establish that she was targeted at that time for any reason whatsoever, including her ethnicity, by setting fire to her XXXX.\nThe uncontested Refugee Protection Division conclusions are correct\n[32] The RPD's uncontested conclusions, including those concerning the absence of problems in Yaound\u00e9 in the seven months prior to her departure, her failure to establish that the attack on her husband was linked in any way to her refugee protection claim and the fact that she did not establish a serious possibility of persecution by reason of her membership in the social group of women, are, in my view, correct.\nThe appellant did not discharge her burden of proof\n[33] For all these reasons, the appellant did not discharge her burden of establishing that there is a credible prospective risk under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the determination of the RPD that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMichel Colin\nMe Michel Colin\nMarch 2, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal Language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Appellants fear members of the armed group \"ELN\", who they reported to the police after the ELN members purportedly made death threats against them and extorted them on four occasions.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellants' claim for refugee protection because it believed that some of their allegations central to the claim were not credible because of contradictions that it noticed between their written narrative and their testimony at the hearing, and because of their delay in leaving Columbia. The RPD also concluded, alternatively, that although it deemed the Appellants' allegations to be credible, there was an internal flight alternative (IFA) for the Appellants in Santander, in Sucre or in Putumayo.\n[3] The Appellants argue that the RPD committed a breach of procedural fairness when it concluded that there were IFAs in Santander, in Sucre or in Putumayo because it had never given the Principal Appellant an opportunity to familiarize himself with the evidence that he had to rebut in that regard. The Appellants argue that the RPD also committed a breach of procedural fairness because it should have conducted a differentiated analysis of credibility pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). They contend that the RPD also erred in its general finding of negative credibility and that it committed errors in its analysis of the IFAs.\n[4] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) concluded that the determinative issue with regard to this appeal is credibility. After carrying out an independent analysis of the record in the light of the Appellants' arguments, the RAD concludes that the RPD did not err in its analysis of the credibility of the Appellants' allegations. The RAD agrees with the RPD's conclusion that the Appellants failed to establish the alleged facts in a credible manner and therefore that they failed to establish (a) that they will face a serious possibility of persecution if they return to Columbia, or (b) would personally face a danger of torture, a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they return to Columbia. It is therefore not necessary for the RAD to address the Appellants' arguments relative to the RPD's conclusions about the proposed IFAs.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The RAD dismisses the appeal. The RPD was right to conclude that the Appellants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The RAD must carry out a probing, thorough, comprehensive and independent review of the submitted evidence in the light of the Appellant's arguments on appeal.1 In this case, the RAD listened to the recording of the hearing before the RPD and applied the standard of correctness.\n[7] The Associated Appellant was appointed the designated representative for the Associated Minor Appellants before the RPD. She will continue to be the appointed representative before the RAD because the Associated Appellants concerned are still minors.\nCredibility\nExtortion on 17 occasions instead of four\n[8] The Appellants stated in their written narrative that they were victims of extortion by members of the ELN armed group on four occasions between XXXX and XXXX 2017, but the RPD noted that during the Principal Appellant's testimony, he stated that they were victims of extortion by members of the ELN armed group on 17 occasions between XXXX 2017 and XXXX 2018. The RPD did not accept the explanation where he said that the most serious incidents because (i) it was a major change in the written narrative; (ii) there was a considerable difference between four and 17 extortion incidents; (iii) it was important to mention such a large number of extortion demands from such a powerful armed group; and (iv) they had only reported four extortion incidents in the complaint filed with the police. The RPD therefore drew a negative credibility inference.2\n[9] The Appellants contend that the RPD erred because the Principal Appellant reported all major incidents in his written narrative, and they deemed the 13 incidents that were not mentioned on the BOC Form as not being important. They argue that the RPD carried out a microscopic analysis of the matter. They contend that the Principal Appellant's testimony completed what he had stated in his written narrative and that this should not undermine his credibility overall because the general factual matrix is not affected. They also point out that the Principal Appellant provided a clarification in saying that there were 17 extortion incidents before the RPD began to ask questions about them and that he should not be punished for spontaneously providing this clarification. They argue that his detailed testimony, made without hesitation and full of conviction, should play in his favour with respect to the credibility of this statement at the hearing. They contend that the RPD should give the benefit of the doubt to the credible explanations and justifications provided by the Appellant.3\n[10] The RAD finds that the RPD did not err when it drew a negative credibility inference because of the contradiction between the written narrative and the Principal Appellant's testimony regarding the number of times that they were purportedly extorted by the ELN armed group. The RAD notes that the RPD was correct in noting that the written narrative indicated four extortion incidents, but that the Principal Appellant had testified that he had experienced 17 incidents.4 The RAD notes that the written narrative gives no indication that there were more than four extortion incidents; therefore, it cannot accept the Appellants' argument that it was just a clarification. If it is true that they were the victims of extortion on 17 occasions, but the four incidents described in the written narrative are the most serious, the RAD notes that it is reasonable to expect there to be at least a mention included in the written narrative to the effect that there were other incidents. Moreover, as noted by the RPD in the decision, even in the Principal Appellant's reporting to the municipal police, he says that \"I was the victim of four (4) extortions.\"5\n[11] By way of explanation for submitting this additional information at the start of the hearing, the Appellant stated that when he was talking to the Associate Appellant and reading their written narrative on the morning of the hearing, they noticed that they should clarify what was written in the narrative.6 Although the RAD acknowledges that the Principal Appellant raised the allegation-spontaneously at the start of the hearing and before the RPD even began asking questions-that they were victims of extortion on 17 occasions, the Appellants were represented by counsel when they filled out the BOC Form and the narrative that they signed in May 20187, as well as while preparing for the hearing before the RPD. In addition, the RPD Rules state that changes or additions to the BOC Form must be made no later than 10 days before the hearing.8 The RAD noted that the Appellant had not provided a satisfactory reason for submitting this additional information at the hearing.\n[12] The RAD finds that the RPD failed to state that this credibility issue had undermined his credibility as a whole. Instead, it drew an overall negative credibility inference, and the RAD is of the opinion that it did not err, given the extent of the contradiction between the written narrative and the Principal Appellant's testimony about the number of extortion incidents that he purportedly experienced. The RAD therefore finds that the RPD's analysis in that regard was not microscopic. The RAD also agrees with the RPD that being extorted on 17 occasions is important information that is central to the claim for refugee protection because the number of extortion incidents experienced helps to demonstrate the interest of the agents of harm in the Appellants-which is clearly different between four and 17 extortion incidents. The RAD does not agree with the Appellants' argument that his detailed testimony, made without hesitation and full of conviction, should play in his favour with respect to this point because the RAD notes that he did not provide details of the 13 other incidents and omitted to provide a sufficiently good reason for not providing details in his narrative. In addition, the RAD notes that the RPD did not err when it did not give the benefit of the doubt to the Appellant because this is not the only credibility problem that the RPD noted and that the RAD confirms, as explained below.9\n[13] The RAD also notes, as an aside, that in addition to having stated that there were 17 incidents instead of four, the Principal Appellant stated at the start of the hearing that the extorted amounts were much higher. According to the narrative, the armed group purportedly extorted 6,800,000 pesos in the four incidents, but according to the Principal Appellant's testimony at the start of the hearing, the group purportedly extorted 32,000,000 pesos in 17 incidents-which is a difference of more than 25 million pesos.10 The RAD is of the opinion that, as with the change in the number of extortion incidents, the extorted amounts help to demonstrate the interest of the agents of harm in the Appellants. For the RAD, the Principal Appellant's testimony at the start of the hearing significantly changed this interest when he stated that they had been the victims of extortion on more occasions that they had stated in the narrative and for a much larger amount than what they had stated in their narrative.\n[14] For all of these reasons, the RAD believes that the contradiction concerning the number of extortion incidents experienced by the Appellants, for which no satisfactory explanation was provided, seriously undermines the Appellants' overall credibility.\nTime when the Appellants were found after moving in with the sister\n[15] The RPD also noted that the Principal Appellant stated during the hearing that members of the ELN armed group found them the day after they moved in with his sister, but in the written narrative, he stated instead that it was in early XXXX that they were purportedly found. The RPD did not accept his explanation that it was 25 days later that they were found because this explanation does not explain the contradiction. The RPD therefore drew another negative credibility inference.11\n[16] The Appellants contend that the RPD misled the Principal Appellant on this point because it told the Appellant that he had stated that they had been undisturbed for a month at his sister's before they were extorted again, but in fact, the narrative did not mention any passage of time and they never stated that they been undisturbed for a month. According to the Appellants, there is no contradiction.12\n[17] The RAD finds that the RPD did not err when it drew an overall negative credibility inference on this point. First, the RAD notes that the RPD did not mislead the Principal Appellant because, after saying at the hearing that the Principal Appellant had stated in the narrative that they had been undisturbed for a month, the RPD corrected itself and said \"it is perhaps one month, that says the following month; the fact is that it is perhaps a few weeks after,\" while emphasizing that in any case, it was not the next day.13 Second, the RAD notes that the RPD is correct in stating that the Principal Appellant testified that on the day after they moved in with this sister, they were extorted at her home.14 Although the Appellants are correct in saying that the written narrative gives no specific dates in that regard, the RAD notes that the Principal Appellant wrote that after the first extortion incident on XXXX XXXX, 2017, they decided to move in with his sister, that they settled in a room in her home and that \"in the following month\", two men came to extort money from them again in early XXXX.15 It is clear in the written narrative that a certain amount of time passed between the time they moved and the next extortion incident, which purportedly happened at the sister's home. Consequently, the fact that he stated at the hearing that the day after they moved, the armed group found them at his sister's home is inconsistent with their written narrative. Although it is true that when the RPD confronted the Appellant with the contradiction between his written narrative and his testimony, the Appellant stated that the armed group found them about 25 days later. He did not provide an explanation for having initially stated that it was the next day.16 After taking a break, the RPD returned to the matter and when it asked the Appellant why he had stated that they had been found the day after they moved, and the Appellant stated that the extortion incident at his sister's home had occurred \"the day after we moved, a few weeks after the first extortion incident.\"17 The RAD notes that this answer is also inconsistent with the written narrative, and the RAD agrees with the RPD that this negatively affects the credibility of the Appellants' allegations because the Principal Appellant's testimony in that regard changed the chronology of the events, as related in the written narrative. Lastly, and in passing, the RAD notes that the Principal Appellant had stated at the hearing that his sister's address was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they had moved in with her after the first extortion incident in XXXX 2013,18 but he stated on his immigration forms that they had moved to that address in XXXX 2017.19\nComplaint filed with the authorities\n[18] The RPD drew another overall negative credibility inference because the Principal Appellant alleged that they fear returning to Columbia because ELN members know that they reported them to the authorities. The RPD noted that, according to the Appellants' written narrative, they were purportedly so afraid of reprisals that they named the ELN group in their complaint. During the hearing, the Principal Appellant also testified that he had not named the group in the complaint but claimed that they are in danger because they reported the ELN group to the authorities when they filed their complaint in XXXX 2017. The RPD asked how the ELN would have known about the complaint if the group had not been named in the complaint. The RPD did not accept his explanation that they had found out that he had reported them nor his explanation that the authorities are corrupt and that the ELN holds sway in his region. The RPD noted that these explanations were insufficient because they do not explain how the ELN group could have found out that the claimants filed a complaint against them if they had not been named.20\n[19] Further on in the decision, the RPD asked why the ELN group was going after them and why it was interested in them if they returned to the country, but noted that the Principal Appellant had testified that it was because they had reported them. Faced with the fact that the Appellants had stated that they had not named the group in their complaint, the RPD also took this into account in its analysis of the risks of returning.21\n[20] The Appellants contend that the RPD concluded that it was implausible that the ELN armed group had an opportunity to find out that the Principal Appellant had filed a complaint about one of its extortion operations. The Appellants reminded the RAD that conclusions of implausibility should only be drawn in the most obvious cases. According to the Appellants, the documentation in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Colombia states that (i) the ELN operates in the area where the Appellants were living; and (ii) \"talks about police corruption, because they collaborate with organized crime groups, such as the ELN, which has infiltrated official institutions and set up alliances with public officials.\"22 Therefore, the Appellants argue that it is quite plausible that, despite the omission to name the group in the complaint, this criminal gang had been informed that one of these victims had filed a complaint against them.23\n[21] The RAD notes that the RPD did not err when it a drew an overall negative credibility inference with respect to this point. The RAD notes that the document in the NDP cited by the Appellants-which the Appellants allege talks about police corruption and says that the police collaborate with organized crime groups-does not state what they allege. The document states that police impunity is a problem,24 but there is no mention in this document that the police collaborate with criminal groups or that these criminal groups have infiltrated official institutions or had set up alliances with public officials.25 Nevertheless, the RAD notes that the Principal Appellant described his agents of harm in his complaint as a \"group of delinquents.\"26 The RAD agrees with the RPD that it is not very likely that the armed group would learn so quickly (within two days after the complaint was filed) that the Principal Appellant had reported the facts to the police when he had not even named the group in his complaint, although the group operates in the area where they were living. However, even if the group discovered it, despite the omission of the group's name in his complaint, the RAD does not see why the armed group would have sought to exact revenge on the Appellants, especially given that the Principal Appellant did not name the group and alleges that he gave them money every time that they demanded it from him. The RAD also notes that the Appellants did not allege in their written narrative that they had other problems with the armed group after the incident in which they were purportedly attacked in their car two days after filing their complaint with the police in XXXX 2017, despite their living at the home of the Principal Appellant's sister at the time and until they left the country in XXXX 2018. Given that the Principal Appellant did not report the group's name in his complaint to the police, like the RPD, the RAD does not see either why the group would target them again for having reported them, should they return to Columbia.\nDelay in leaving the country\n[22] The RPD noted that the Appellants delayed their departure from Columbia. It asked the Principal Appellant why they waited until February 2018 to take steps to obtain a visa to the United States in order to leave the country. It did not accept his explanation that in September 2017, they had applied for a visa to Canada, which was refused in October 2017, because this did not address his concern. According to the RPD, their lives were threatened several times, but they waited five months after the Canadian visa was refused in order to apply for a visa to the United States. It deemed that this behaviour was not the behaviour of persons whose lives are in danger and that it contradicted their allegation that they had a subjective fear.27\n[23] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred on this point because neither the IRPA nor the Convention provide for a maximum time period for leaving the country following persecution. The Appellants also say that their main contention was that their request for refugee protection falls under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA and that the \"subjective fear\" is only an element to be taken into consideration for analysis purposes pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. They argue that the delay in leaving the country is not a determinative issue for disposing of this case. According to the Appellants, the Federal Court says that there is a difference between behaviour that is incompatible with a well-founded fear of persecution and the question of knowing whether or not the written narrative of a claimant's persecution is credible.28\n[24] The RAD finds that the RPD did not err in concluding that their five-month delay before leaving Columbia undermined the Appellants' credibility with respect to the alleged facts. The RAD notes that the RPD drew two conclusions regarding the Appellants' delay in leaving the country: (i) that this contradicts their subjective fear pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA; and (ii) that this does not correspond to the behaviour of persons whose lives are in immediate danger from a group as dangerous as the ELN, pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA. The RAD agrees with the Appellants that the subjective fear is not part of the analysis pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, which does not require the Appellants to establish a subjective fear. However, the RAD believes that acting in a way that is inconsistent with the behaviour of persons whose lives are in danger adversely affects the credibility of the alleged facts. The logic behind this conclusion is that a person who is truly in immediate danger would have fled as quickly as possible.\n[25] Naturally, before drawing this type of negative credibility inference, the explanation given for the delay must be taken into consideration. The RPD concluded that the Appellants' explanations were insufficient, and the RAD does not find any error. First, the RAD notes that the Appellants stated in their written narrative that they had purportedly received death threats on several occasions from the armed group during four extortion incidents that purportedly occurred between XXXX and XXXX 2017.29 During the hearing, the RPD cited the Appellant's written narrative, which says that after the attack when the Appellants were attacked in their car, which purportedly occurred in XXXX 2017, \"that is when we decided, in XXXX XXXX XXXX, to take all necessary steps to obtain our visa to the United States,\" and asked the Principal Appellant why they had not acted before XXXX 2018 to take the steps to obtain a visa to the United States. The Appellant replied that in XXXX 2017, they had applied for a visa to Canada, which was refused in XXXX 2017.30 When the RPD explained that five months passed between Canada's refusal and when they started to take steps to obtain the visa, the Principal Appellant replied: \"exactly; that was not the time; it was in the month of XXXX.\"31 When the RPD asked why they had waited until XXXX, he replied that they acknowledged that every time they did something out of the ordinary, there had been repercussions for them.32 However, the RAD notes that the fact that they applied for a visa to Canada in XXXX 2017 indicates that they had already decided that it was necessary to leave the country, and that they were looking for a way to do so. The fact that they would have waited for five months before starting to take the steps to obtain a visa to the United States and after being refused by Canada in XXXX 2017, during a period when, as the Principal Appellant testified, every time they did something out of the ordinary, there had been repercussions for them, undermines the credibility of their allegations.\n[26] In addition, the RAD finds that the Principal Appellant's explanation for their delay in leaving the country is problematic in itself because it is an extension of the allegation that they were extorted 17 times between XXXX 2017 and XXXX 2018-an allegation that contradicted his written narrative, which says that they were extorted four times between XXXX and XXXX 2017, and about which the RPD drew a negative credibility inference, which the RAD confirmed above. In fact, the Principal Appellant testified that they were extorted every two weeks during this period and until XXXX 2018,33 but at the same time, the Principal Appellant did not allege in his written narrative that they had had a problem with the armed group after XXXX 2017 or before the Appellants left to go to the United States in XXXX 2018, which is inconsistent with his explanation during the hearing that \"there had been repercussions for them\" during that period.\n[27] Lastly, although the RAD agrees with the Appellants' argument that the delay in leaving the country is not a determinative issue, it is at the very least an element that can be taken into consideration in the credibility assessment. The RAD notes that the RPD did not conclude that this credibility problem in particular undermined the Appellants' credibility entirely, but this delay in leaving the country-for which no satisfactory reasons were provided-nonetheless had a negative effect on the credibility of their allegations and the RAD is in agreement.\nTime of filing of the complaint\n[28] The RPD drew a negative credibility inference from the fact that the Appellants only filed a complaint two days before they fled the country because it deemed their explanation for having filed a complaint at that time to be unsatisfactory. According to the Appellants, they filed a complaint at that time because they wanted to be protected and because they had purchased plane tickets when they noticed that they would not be protected. The RPD did not accept the explanation because, according to their testimony, they had been trying to leave the country since XXXX 2017, but the explanation suggests that they finally decided to leave the country after the last complaint.34\n[29] The Appellants contend that the trigger for leaving the country was the slowness of the \"Personneria\" authorities to take measures to protect them. They denied having considered the possibility of leaving the country before, but they did not make the decision to leave Columbia until they saw that they were vulnerable owing to the lack of protection from that organization and their dwindling financial resources. For the Appellants, the decision to leave was a difficult decision to make, and it is reasonable to expect that people have difficulty making such a decision.35\n[30] The RAD concludes that the RPD did not err when it drew a negative credibility inference on this point. The problem raised by the RPD is not simply the time when the Appellants filed a complaint with the Personneria, but also their allegation that it was the lack of protection from this organization that led them to leave the country.\n[31] The RAD agrees with the RPD that the Appellants were not consistent about the time when they made the decision to leave the country. According to their written narrative, they went to Bogota in XXXX 2017 for two days in order to apply for a visa to Canada, \"seeing that the situation was going from bad to worse and we were in the hands of the most blood-thirsty group in the country.\"36 The RAD also notes that they also stated near the end of the written narrative that they made the decision to flee in XXXX XXXX XXXX when they began taking steps to obtain a visa to the United States.37 Although the RAD accepts that it is difficult to make the decision to flee their country of origin and residence, there are two times in the written narrative where the Appellants allege that they made the decision to flee the country: XXXX 2017 and XXXX 2018. However, they began taking concrete steps to leave, starting in XXXX 2017, when they applied for a tourist visa to Canada.\n[32] Although the Appellants contend that the trigger for leaving the country was the slowness of the \"Personneria\" authorities to take measures to protect them, the RAD cannot accept this argument either. According to the evidence in the record, the Appellants filed a complaint with the Personneria on XXXX XXXX, 2018,38 and they left Columbia to go to the United States on XXXX XXXX, 2018,39 and in the written narrative, they explain that they filed the complaint with the Personneria two days before their trip to the United States.40 During the hearing, the RPD confirmed with the Appellants that they had already purchased their plane tickets for the United States when they filed the complaint and they confirmed it.41 The fact of having obtained visas and purchased plane tickets for the United States is clear evidence that they had already made the decision to leave Columbia when they filed their complaint with the Personneria. At the same time, they left the country two days after filing the complaint with the Personneria-it is illogical to find that the Personneria was \"slow\" if it is only given two days to take action. The RAD finds that it is inconsistent to state that they were seeking protection from the government, when they had plane tickets in hand and a departure scheduled two days later. The RAD therefore notes that the RPD was correct to conclude that the inconsistencies concerning (i) the time when the complaint was filed with the Personneria and (ii) the time when they decided to leave the country had a negative effect on the credibility of the Appellants' allegations.\nDifferentiated analysis\n[33] The RAD finds the Appellants' argument42 on appeal to be vague, but although the argument refers to the RPD's conclusion regarding the subjective fear, the RAD deals with this argument earlier on in this decision. It is also possible that the Appellants' argument that there is an aspect of the claim that the conclusions about credibility do not cover, and which must still be addressed. However, the Appellants did not identify the aspect that was not addressed in the appeal memorandum and the RAD does not see it either.\n[34] Nevertheless, the Appellants appear to argue that the RPD erred and that there was a breach of procedural fairness because it did not explain whether the credibility analysis had been done pursuant to section 96 or subsection 97(1), because this claim for refugee protection required a differentiated analysis of credibility.43 The RAD does not agree. All refugee protection claimants must establish the facts in support of their claim for refugee protection on a balance of probabilities, and the claim must be analyzed pursuant to section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. In the decision, the RPD concluded that the Appellants' allegations were not credible, which means that they failed to establish the facts in support of their claim for refugee protection on a balance of probabilities. The RAD agrees that the allegations were not credible. Consequently, regardless of whether or not the analysis was carried out pursuant to section 96 or subsection 97(1), they have not established the alleged facts on a balance of probabilities. Therefore, the result would have been the same and it was not necessary to explain under which section or subsection the analysis was carried out.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] The RAD finds that the RPD did not err in its analysis of the credibility of the Appellants' allegations. The credibility problems raised by the RPD and confirmed by the RPD in the foregoing are sufficient to conclude that the Appellants' allegations were not credible and, consequently, that they failed to establish the facts in support of their claim for refugee protection, on a balance of probabilities.\n[36] Given that the RAD finds that the determinative issue is credibility, it is not necessary for the RAD to address the Appellants' arguments regarding the analysis and the conclusions drawn by the RPD regarding the proposed IFAs, including the arguments concerning the breach of procedural fairness that deal with how the RPD came up with the proposed IFAs and the alleged omission to have discussed conditions in those regions.44\n[37] The RAD notes that the Appellants have failed to establish the facts in support of their claim for refugee protection. The RAD therefore concludes that the Appellants have failed to establish that they will face a serious possibility of persecution if they return to Columbia or that they would personally face a danger of torture, a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they return to Columbia.\nDETERMINATION\n[38] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMiriam McLeod\nMiriam McLeod\nApril 14, 2021\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They fear persecution by the authorities in their country and the Algerian population because the male appellant is an atheist. The female appellant fears her brother, who does not accept her husband's atheism.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the appellants not to be credible due to contradictions, omissions and inconsistent behaviour between the testimony and the male appellant's Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) regarding the threats received in connection with his atheism, as well as the female appellant's vague and varying testimony, a contradiction concerning the female appellant's subjective fear and her inconsistent behaviour in returning to Algeria for one month with her daughter XXXX.\n[3] The appellants argue that the RPD's reasons are unintelligible and obscure concerning the [translation] \"contradictions\" about the threats received and the male appellant's \"testimony additions,\" that it distorted his testimony and put words in his mouth, that the RPD harassed the male appellant, that it ignored corroborating evidence and that it gave the impression that no hearing had been held. They are of the opinion that the RPD did not understand Algerian society, in particular the situation of women.\n[4] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is the subjective fear of persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD correctly concluded that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The appellants failed to establish a subjective fear of persecution.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The appellants submitted the RPD decision and several jurisprudential decisions1 as new evidence. This is not new evidence within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,2 and I cannot admit it. I considered these documents in my analysis. They are requesting an oral hearing, which I cannot grant since I have not admitted any new evidence.3\nANALYSIS\n[7] My role is to examine all of the evidence, which includes listening to the hearing, and to establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.4\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not breach procedural fairness or natural justice\n[8] Throughout their memorandum, the appellants, through their immigration consultant, make several generic accusations against the RPD. They refer to [translation] \"unintelligible and obscure reasons,\" \"festivals of errors,\" that the RPD should have demonstrated \"a modicum of personal culture,\" that it sought to fuel a contradiction to justify rejecting the refugee protection claim, that it harassed the male appellant by asking him questions he had already answered, \"pretended to take it into account only to discard it with senseless arguments,\" that it gave \"the impression that there had not been a hearing and that the panel gave a monologue,\" and that the RPD not only made errors of law, but that this also calls into question its good faith.\n[9] These arguments are a way of challenging the RPD's bias, yet a breach of procedural fairness must be clearly identified, not formulated in all respects indiscriminately.\n[10] Furthermore, I am concerned by the language used, which is inappropriate, has no place in an appeal memorandum and shows a lack of respect for the RPD. For example, the memorandum states that the RPD should have demonstrated a \"modicum of personal culture.\" It is also stated that [translation] \"The panel's approach-whereby it unreasonably rejects the refugee protection claimant's explanations, demonstrates XXXX, in order to uphold a finding of non-credibility-is fundamentally unfair. This is a breach of natural justice. [Emphasis added.]\" XXXX is a neurological difference faced by a portion of the population. The expression [translation] \"demonstrates XXXX\" cannot be used to negatively describe a person's behaviour or judgment.\n[11] The qualifiers used by the appellants' counsel in reference to the RPD member do not make the arguments more logical. However, I will not hold it against the appellants. I have analyzed this appeal according to the arguments presented and the evidence before me. I do not accept the appellants' general prejudice arguments made by counsel.\n[12] After listening to the recording of the RPD hearing and reading the reasons, I cannot accept the appellants' arguments on procedural fairness and natural justice.\nBias\n[13] In terms of the requirements of impartiality, I have no complaints against the RPD. After listening to the hearing and reading the RPD's reasons in depth, realistically and practically, I have no reasonable apprehension of bias by the RPD toward the appellants and I do not believe that it was biased.\nRight to be heard\n[14] The RPD questioned both appellants on their allegations for nearly three (3) hours. Throughout the hearing, it asked them open-ended questions and sought to clarify their testimony and written account. It did not try to trap them. It informed them of its concerns in light of the contradictions and omissions noted and gave them the opportunity to provide explanations.\n[15] Questioning a refugee protection claimant in order to clarify their evidence or test their credibility is not a breach of procedural fairness,5 and I noted no sign of harassment of the male appellant. The appellants' counsel was able to question them at the end of the hearing and made submissions. Neither the appellants nor their counsel raised any issues of procedural fairness during the hearing.\nAdequacy of reasons\n[16] Even though the decision of the RPD is not organized like the RAD decision, it rejected the refugee protection claim by basing its conclusions on clear, specific and intelligible elements, namely, that the appellants are not credible due to the following contradictions, omissions and inconsistent behaviour:\n(1) Contradictions and omissions in the male claimant's testimony and written account concerning the threats received in connection with his atheism.\n(2) The female appellant's vague and shifting testimony.\n(3) Contradiction concerning the female appellant's subjective fear: she indicated that she was not worried when two people visited her home in Algiers, yet she stated at another point that she feared them.\n(4) Inconsistent behaviour: Ms. XXXX and her daughter XXXX returned to the country from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, 2019.\n[17] The reasons for the RPD's decision are adequate.\n[18] After analyzing the hearing and the RPD's reasons, I conclude that the appellants' right to procedural fairness and natural justice was not breached.\nThe appellants failed to establish a subjective fear of persecution\n[19] The appellants failed to establish a subjective fear of persecution, which, under section 96, is fatal to a refugee protection claim for reasons of religion. They filed their refugee protection claim in October 2019, yet they have been fearing for their lives since XXXX 2019 (threats from the authorities) and\/or XXXX 2019 (female appellant's brother). In addition to the delay in claiming refugee protection, the female appellant returned to Algeria with her daughter despite fearing the government in relation to her husband's atheism, and she delayed leaving Algeria for one month even though her brother had threatened her and she had been visited by the authorities in relation to her husband.\nDelay in filing the refugee protection claim and returning to the alleged country of persecution\n[20] The RPD noted a contradiction by the male appellant regarding his intentions when he left Algeria on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and the fact that he waited until October 2019 to claim refugee protection. It pointed out that he was unable to explain the contradiction concerning his intentions when he left Algeria in XXXX 2019, persisting in his contradiction. It drew a negative inference as to the credibility of his allegations. It was of the opinion that the delay in claiming refugee protection is behaviour that is inconsistent with the alleged fear. In the view of the RPD, the male appellant's explanations that he really started to be afraid with the telephone call from his angry in-laws about his atheism contradict his original statement that he began to fear for his life in XXXX 2019, and the delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada indicates a lack of subjective fear.\n[21] The appellants submit that the RPD acted in bad faith when it concluded a lack of subjective fear, by considering that the fact that the male appellant's claims that the call on XXXX XXXX, 2019, from his angry in-laws about his atheism made him realize that this was the end and that he had to leave the country contradicts his previous responses. They argue that this was merely an additional explanation and that even though they might have been expected to leave the country earlier, doing so is not an easy decision to make, he had never thought about it and that this explains why he did not claim refugee protection in XXXX 2019. In the appellants' view, their explanation is reasonable, and the RPD did not have to infer a lack of subjective fear, that the decisive moment to leave was the in-laws' anger, and it should have given him the benefit of the doubt.\n[22] The RPD did not act in bad faith and analyzed the facts by taking the appellants' written and verbal statements into account. Even though I do not come to the same conclusion as the RPD as to when the fear of persecution began, there was still a delay in claiming refugee protection, which undermines the appellants' subjective fear of persecution. In addition to this delay are the female appellant's return to the alleged country of persecution and her behaviour with respect to the risk in Algeria, as I will analyze later in these reasons.\n[23] The governing principles concerning delay in seeking refugee protection are well established by the case law,6 even though delay is generally not determinative. In this case, the delay, together with the female appellant's return to Algeria and her delay in leaving the country despite her fear, is determinative.\n[24] In the BOC Form, the male appellant states that [translation] \"the agent talked to me about my books and the evidence they had on my atheism and they were pressuring me\"7 after having explained the attempted recruitment for the committee. He then states [translation] \"if he revealed that to my relatives or my work, I was risking a lot and was even risking going to prison.\"8 [Translation] \"On XXXX XXXX, 2019, since we had visas for Canada, I decided to make myself forgotten until things calmed down. I usually go on vacation every year and for me it was just temporary.\"9 At that time, the appellants had no intention of claiming refugee protection, according to their BOC Form. He then states, [translation] \"On XXXX XXXX, 2019, an anonymous call was made to my father-in-law telling him that his daughter had married a traitor to the nation and an atheist manipulated by foreign hands and that his daughter was in danger.\"10\n[25] The first part of the male appellant's testimony at the hearing was consistent with his BOC Form. He explained that the authorities asked him to mobilize young people against the Hirak and that he was summoned to a meeting for that purpose on XXXX XXXX, 2019.11 He testified that he rejected the proposal and that to put pressure on him, the authorities who were present talked to him about photographs of books on atheism that he had brought back from Nice, France, and that were in his office and that they [translation] \"were going to make a big deal.\"12 He explained that, to buy himself some time, he told them he would think about it and that it would take time to mobilize the youth.13 He then explained that he had no intention of staying in Canada and that he had left just until things settled down.14\n[26] On returning from the break, the male appellant stated that he began to fear for his life on XXXX XXXX, 2019, that it was a [translation] \"catastrophe,\" that he decided to leave the country right after, that he did not sleep that night and that he thought about saving his skin, that they were truly in danger.15 When the RPD asked him why he had testified earlier that he had had no intention of staying, he explained that he wanted things to calm down and that on XXXX XXXX, he decided that it was impossible to go back and that everyone would know about his problems.16 He explained that he had originally planned to stay for two months, without specifying the anticipated return date.17 He later reiterated that XXXX XXXX was the end, that he knew what they (editor's note: the authorities) were capable of. He explained that on XXXX XXXX, he thought to himself that perhaps they did not have a lot of evidence and that maybe they would not call his father-in-law and his family, but that they did so on XXXX XXXX. He told himself at that point [translation] \"It's OK,\" that he was afraid for himself, his family, his wife, and he told himself \"this is it,\"18 that they might seek revenge on his family.19\n[27] After reading the BOC Form and listening to the hearing, I conclude that the male appellant fears that the authorities, his family and friends and the population in Algeria will find out about his atheism and that they might go after not only him, but also his family (his wife and children).\n[28] At the hearing, the male appellant's testimony changed about the moment he truly feared for his life. However, I accept the explanations that their alleged intention in XXXX 2019 was to stay temporarily until things calmed down, hoping that the authorities would not carry out their threat to publicize the male appellant's atheism.\n[29] I point out that even though the onset of their fear of persecution was not final in XXXX 2019, the analysis of the appellants' written and verbal statements establishes that it became so on XXXX XXXX, 2019, after the anonymous appellant received by the female appellant's father. An individual allegedly warned the family that their son-in-law was an atheist, that the female appellant was in danger with him, that he was a traitor to the nation20 and that it was someone in the government who had apparently decided to publicize his atheism.\n[30] The fear of persecution was indeed real as of XXXX XXXX, 2019, yet the appellants did not claim refugee protection in the days\/weeks that followed. On the contrary, despite the danger, the female appellant returned to Algeria, the alleged country of persecution, which undermines the credibility of her subjective fear. Moreover, when she returned to Canada in September 2019, the appellants waited another three months before filing their refugee protection claim on November 7, 2019,21 which undermines the credibility of her subjective fear.\n[31] The RPD was of the opinion that the fact that the female appellant and the female minor appellant, XXXX, went back for one month in XXXX and XXXX 2019 constitutes behaviour that is inconsistent with that of a person at risk of persecution and that it is reasonable to believe that a person whose life is at risk would not subject themselves to such a risk despite the health condition of a member of their family. It was of the opinion that the female appellant's behaviour was inconsistent with her alleged fear given the seriousness of the alleged consequences on a person whose atheism had been revealed and his family. Furthermore, the RPD criticized the female appellant for not having mentioned at the start of the hearing that she feared the authorities because of her husband's atheism.\n[32] The appellants argue that the RPD's poor understanding of Algerian society biased the analysis of the female appellant's testimony throughout the reasons. For example, the RPD mentioned inconsistent behaviour, when the female appellant had no choice but to return to her country because of her father's serious illness.\n[33] I do not accept the argument that the RPD did not understand Algerian society. Even if the family requirement that a woman go to her father's bedside when he is seriously ill or even dying can be justified culturally or humanely, it cannot be explained in a context of a fear of persecution. The appellants are seeking Canada's protection from Algeria because they fear facing a serious possibility of persecution there. It is normal to expect that the female appellant and her daughter would not go back to the alleged country of persecution, even if her father was ill.\n[34] At the hearing, the male appellant clearly testified that when he was informed of the call to his in-laws in XXXX 2019, he began fearing persecution, as I previously addressed in my reasons. As the lives and safety of the female appellant and the female minor appellant were at risk as of XXXX XXXX, 2019, it is logical to expect that they would not go back to the country of alleged persecution, regardless of the health of the female appellant's father and the behaviour that the family expected of a daughter toward her father. The female appellant's and female minor appellant's return to Algeria undermines the credibility of their subjective fear of persecution.\n[35] The appellants delayed claiming refugee protection. In addition to this is the fact that the female appellant returned to the alleged country of persecution with her daughter, when the male appellant clearly testified that he feared that the authorities would go after his family to get to him. The anonymous caller called the female appellant's family, not the male appellant's family, which confirms the willingness to go after the family to get to him. The female appellant's and female minor appellant's return to the alleged country of persecution undermines the credibility of the subjective fear of persecution and is in addition to the delay in claiming refugee protection.\nAgents' visit to the appellants' home in Algeria during the female appellant's stay\n[36] The RPD was of the opinion that the allegations that DRS agents went looking for the male appellant at his home to blackmail him are speculative and based on his and his wife's personal impressions, that the people in plain clothes did not disclose the purpose of their visit, that they did not make any threats, and that they came only once when the female appellant was there for one month, that the male appellant is a public figure and that many people could have wanted to get in touch with him for a myriad of reasons that are unknown. It was of the opinion that it is inconsistent that the female appellant claimed not to be worried about the visit paid by the two people to her home in XXXX 2019 when she feared that she was targeted by the Algerian authorities who wanted to get to her to make her husband pay.\n[37] The appellants submit that the RPD should show a modicum of personal culture and open-mindedness with respect to its conclusion that the appellants did not establish that the two people who went to their home in XXXX 2019 were from the DRC or that they were looking for the male appellant to harm or blackmail him because of his atheism.\n[38] The appellants do not explain how the RPD lacked culture or was closed-minded. If they are referring to a specific aspect of Algerian culture that the RPD should have taken into account, they must specifically explain what they are referring to and how that could have changed the RPD's conclusion.\n[39] At the hearing, the female appellant testified that the individuals did not identify themselves, that she noted that they were carrying a weapon and that she deduced that they were the security services because they were armed.22 She stated that the individuals said nothing and made no direct or indirect threat, that the individuals simply asked about the male appellant's whereabouts. Nothing indicates that the individuals were there and asked for the male appellant in connection with his atheism. The male appellant had left his home two months earlier, and it is therefore possible that someone was looking for him for one reason or another. They came only once while the female appellant was in Algeria for one month. The visit by two unknown individuals in one month, who did not threaten the female appellant or the family, who made no link to the male appellant's atheism, does not lead to the conclusion that they were government agents or that they were looking for the male appellant to harm him, pressure him or imprison him because of his atheism.\n[40] The female appellant alleges that she believed they were from the government and that they were looking for her husband. In this case, this undermines the credibility of her subjective fear, because after they left, she stayed in Algeria until XXXX XXXX, 2019, despite the fact that the fear of persecution had become real since the anonymous call. Despite the alleged fear, she did not seek to hide or to leave Algeria. At the hearing, she explained that she was not really worried since she knew that her husband was safe.23 This corroborates the fact that, at that time, she had no subjective fear that the authorities would go after her for her husband's atheism, yet the male appellant clearly testified that he feared for himself and his family.\n[41] The appellants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that in XXXX 2019, government agents tried to locate the male appellant in connection with his atheism.\nThe female appellant's and the female minor appellant's delay in leaving Algeria\n[42] The RPD concluded that the female appellant was not credible because her response was unclear as to the call from her family in which they confronted her about her husband's atheism, when this was a turning point in their fear. The RPD was of the opinion that her testimony was shifting and inconsistent regarding her alleged fear of her brother, and the fact that she continued to stay less than a kilometre from her brother's home when she was afraid of him is inconsistent with the alleged fear.\n[43] The appellants submit that when the female appellant testified with maybes or I am not aware, such cautious language can be explained by the particularities of Algerian culture where a woman cannot say certain things to a man if they are about her father, brother or husband. They argue that the RPD made a gross error in drawing a negative inference as to credibility from an erroneous assessment of the facts and a cultural reality that the RPD did not understand.\n[44] Once again, I do not understand which cultural particularity explains the way the female appellant responded to the RPD. When the RPD asked the female appellant what she feared, she answered spontaneously that her brother had been the one who threatened her several times, that he does not want her to be married to an atheist, that he wants her to leave her husband, and that it brings shame on the family.24 She fears that he will hurt her, that he will force her to separate from her husband, which the law would allow, and that he also asked her to leave her children.25 She stated that she arrived in Algeria on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and that on XXXX XXXX or XXXX, her brother yelled that his mother was crying, that he was out of his mind, that he pushed her and that he was uncontrollable.26\n[45] Despite her brother's fury and the threats she took seriously, to the point of claiming refugee protection in Canada to protect herself from him, the female appellant stayed in Algeria after the threats. She explained that after that, she did not go back to her mother's home and that she stayed with her in-laws, her habitual residence, out of fear of running into her brother.27 She testified that she decided to leave the country for good after the altercation with her brother.28 However, her behaviour was inconsistent with this, as she stayed in Algeria another month (between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, 2019) with her daughter, when her brother had also threatened the children of the [translation] \"non-believing miscreant.\" The only safety precaution she took was to stay at her in-laws' home, only one kilometre from her mother's home, her habitual residence. She explained that staying with her in-laws protected her29 and that she was unable to leave earlier because all the flights were full.\n[46] I do not accept these explanations. Even if the flights were full, the female appellant stayed near her alleged agent of persecution at a place he knew, one kilometre from him, at her habitual residence while waiting to leave the country, which suggests an absence of subjective fear. She did not seek to get further away at another temporary residence. She did not allege that her brother tried to go after her during that month or that he tried to file legal proceedings as she alleged he would do.\n[47] The female appellant explained that she fears her brother's anger, that he will file legal proceedings to request her divorce because her husband is an atheist, and that as her brother, he has every right to do so.30 She did not submit any evidence to corroborate that this is possible in Algeria. Even if I accept that it is possible, the brother did nothing while the female appellant was still in Algeria. I note that although she stayed in Algeria for one month, he did nothing to go after her. This suggests an absence of risk in addition to an absence of subjective risk.\n[48] The delay in leaving Algeria despite the alleged risk at the hands of her brother and at the hands of the authorities due to her husband's atheism undermines the credibility of the female appellant's subjective fear.\n[49] The appellants failed to establish a subjective fear of persecution, which is determinative. My decision is based on the accumulation of different elements, including the return of the female appellant and the female minor appellant to the alleged country of persecution, to which I give significant weight in my conclusion.\n[50] Despite the fact that they have feared persecution by the authorities by reason of the female appellant's atheism since XXXX 2019, when this threat became real in XXXX 2019 after an anonymous call to the female appellant's family, she returned with the female minor appellant to the alleged country of persecution. Even after her brother threatened to go after her and her marriage while she was in Algeria, despite the alleged visit by government officials to her home, she delayed leaving the country to return to Canada by one month, without taking any precautions to avoid her agents of persecution. Despite the onset of the fear of persecution, the appellants did not file their refugee protection claim; they did so only after the female appellant returned to the alleged country of persecution and three months after the onset of the fear of persecution.\n[51] The RPD's decision is correct. The appellants would not face a serious possibility of persecution, they would not, on a balance of probabilities, be subjected to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment, or substantial grounds to be subjected to torture if they were to return to Algeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[52] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the determination of the RPD that the appellants XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMe Agn\u00e8s Connat\nMe Agn\u00e8s Connat\nMarch 11, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Refugee Appeal Division Rules, SOR\/2012-257, paragraph 3(3)(f).\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, subs. 110(4).\n3 IRPA, S.C. 2001, c. 27, subs. 110(6).\n4 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his refugee protection claim for lack of credibility.\n[2] The appellant alleges that he fears returning to his country because of his refusal to acknowledge a child born from a relationship with a former college friend. He alleges that he was targeted by this friend's uncle, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[3] The RPD noted the appellant's delay in claiming refugee status, the lack of evidence of the family connection between the girl and XXXX XXXX XXXX, the lack of evidence of the freezing of the scholarship, state protection in the Congo (Brazzaville) and the lack of objective basis with regard to the application of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). It found that the appellant was not credible and rejected his refugee protection claim.\n[4] The appellant submits that he provided spontaneous testimony. He claims that the RPD was over-vigilant in its microscopic examination of the evidence. He submits that the RPD tried to build a case that undermined his credibility by identifying incidental, insignificant and exaggerated elements that do not justify rejecting his refugee protection claim. He argues that the RPD breached a principle of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[5] The determinative issues for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) are whether there was a breach of a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness and whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the appellant's credibility.\n[6] My response to these determinative issues is negative, and I am of the opinion that the appellant is not credible and that the RPD's decision is correct.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD correctly determined that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[8] My role is to examine all the evidence and determine whether the RPD's decision is correct.1 I have assessed all the evidence, I have listened to the recording of the hearing, and I have applied the correctness standard to all the RPD's findings.\nBreach of the principle of natural justice or procedural fairness\n[9] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant asserts that he raised a fear of persecution by the XXXX, notably due to his ethnicity as a person from the south. He submits that the RPD should have analyzed his refugee protection claim under section 96 of the IRPA, which it did not do, which constitutes a breach of procedural fairness or of the principle of natural justice. He relies on the case law to state that the motive of an attack can be both criminal and racial in nature, and that the RPD must examine all the evidence submitted in determining if mixed intentions are sufficient to establish a nexus with one of the Convention grounds. He submits that he raised discrimination against the Laari and claims that the RPD did not identify this important element and did not understand the social and political situation in the Congo, even though counsel tried to explain this aspect in his submissions. He argues that the RPD's reasons are silent on this issue.\n[10] I cannot concur with the appellant's submissions. First, I note that at the beginning of the hearing, the RPD stated the following to the appellant: [translation] \"I should also analyze whether your allegations meet the requirements of section 96, that is, whether there is a nexus to the Geneva Convention or if not whether they are more within the scope of paragraph 97(1)(b), namely threats.\"2 During the second part of the hearing and before counsel started with his submissions, the RPD asked him the following, specifically: [translation] \"Mr. Koudiatou, I mentioned at the beginning that I was questioning the matter of the nexus between the claimant's allegations and section 96, therefore I would obviously like you to address this.\"3\n[11] Furthermore, at paragraph 40 of its reasons, the RPD wrote the following:\n[Translation] The panel also notes that the claimant reported the existence of discrimination between the people from the north and the south of the Republic of the Congo, since the dominant people are from the north and the dominated from the south, and that this could also intervene in the feeling of humiliation given that the claimant is perceived as inferior according to his own testimony. However, in the panel's opinion, this is pure speculation only, given that it entails the feelings of a third party, namely the XXXX whose family connection and involvement has still not been corroborated, but only alleged.4\n[12] In its decision, the RPD also wrote the following:\n[Translation] The panel has examined your refugee protection claim under paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the IRPA, because the above-mentioned harm has no nexus to any of the grounds for persecution under the Convention since the alleged harm would stem from a personal vendetta.5\n[13] All in all, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not fail to examine the appellant's allegations under section 96 of the IRPA, as argued by the appellant. It assessed the appellant's testimony and the evidence on the record in this regard and correctly concluded that the appellant's allegations have no nexus to one of the Convention grounds. Although I recognize that, in his testimony, the appellant alluded to his ethnicity and to the discrimination against nationals from the south, the fact remains that his allegations that the XXXX was persecuting him because of his ethnicity are speculative. Nothing in the evidence on the record indicates that the appellant's ethnicity was at the root of his fears, or at the very least constituted a reason that would peak the interest the agents of harm to go after him. Overall, I am of the opinion that there was no breach of natural justice or procedural fairness.\nDelay in claiming refugee protection\n[14] The appellant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and did not claim refugee protection until the end of November 2018. The RPD considered that if the appellant's allegations were true, it would have been inconsistent to fail or neglect to claim refugee protection at the first opportunity in these circumstances and, regardless of whether the appellant obtained a scholarship, he should have been aware that his entry into Canada was temporary and as such, he could not protect himself from XXXX XXXX with this temporary status. It noted the appellant's statements that he hoped the scholarship would go through normally and that he had been fearing the XXXX since XXXX 2017. It found that the appellant's behaviour was inconsistent with the allegations in support of his refugee protection claim, specifically considering that his life had allegedly been threatened since XXXX 2017. It found that the appellant's behaviour undermined his credibility.\n[15] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant submits that the delay in filing a refugee protection claim is not a determinative factor. He argues that he filed his refugee protection claim three and a half months after he entered Canada and that this delay was not excessive given the COVID-19 pandemic, during which he had to contend with the health measures stipulated by the Government of Quebec, including isolating for 14 days after arriving in Canada, finding out that his scholarship had been frozen-which jeopardized his student status, finding a lawyer, arranging an appointment with the lawyer and filling out immigration forms, and drafting his written account. He maintains that the delay was reasonable in the circumstances.\n[16] I concur in part with the appellant's submissions. The appellant asserts, and I agree, that the delay in claiming refugee protection is not, in itself, determinative. However, I note that the appellant arrived in Canada in XXXX 2018 and only signed his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) and his immigration forms on November 29, 2018,6 well before the onset of the coronavirus in January 2020. That said, between the date he arrived in Canada and the filing of his refugee protection claim, the appellant was not subject to any health measures since there was no coronavirus at that time. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the appellant's submissions with regard to the pandemic and the health measures do not justify the delay in claiming refugee protection given that he alleges that he has been fearing for his life since XXXX 2017.7 The appellant acknowledges in his appeal memorandum that the freezing of his scholarship jeopardized his student status, and yet he did not take appropriate and timely steps to obtain information about the possibility of claiming refugee protection.\n[17] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant submits that he was not living at his brother's home in Canada so that his brother could help him. Even though I concur with the appellant's submissions, the fact remains that he did not demonstrate that he made an effort to obtain information about how to claim refugee protection. The appellant could have consulted counsel or a charitable organization working in the immigration field or at least have asked for help from his brother, a Canadian citizen, to find out about the possibility of claiming refugee protection.\n[18] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant asserts that the RPD did not take into consideration that he had student status that protected him against a potential return to his country. While I agree with the appellant, the fact remains that this status was conditional on the unblocking of the alleged freezing of the scholarship, thereby subjecting him to the risk of being deported to his country. While the appellant's student visa was valid until XXXX XXXX, 2021,8 the fact remains that this validity depended essentially on adhering to the conditions of its issuance, including taking and passing courses at the educational facility. I note that the appellant stated that he did not take any courses at Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke.9 All in all, I am of the opinion that the appellant's behaviour is inconsistent with that of someone who alleges fearing for their life and that the RPD did not err in its conclusion, which I consider to be correct.\nThe existence of the former friend and her family connection to XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[19] The RPD stated that it was aware that the appellant benefits from a rebuttable presumption in that his sworn testimony is deemed to be truthful unless there are valid reasons to doubt it.10 Based on Adu,11 it was of the opinion that the lack of documentary evidence that it would normally be expected to include constitutes a factor that casts doubt on the appellant's testimony and statements and therefore overturns the presumption. The RPD considered the child's birth certificate12 and acknowledged that this evidence indirectly established the existence of the appellant's former friend.\n[20] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant relies on the case law to state that the RPD cannot require evidence to corroborate uncontradicted testimony. The lack of such corroborating evidence may not serve as a basis for deciding to not believe a refugee protection claimant's assertions. He submits that the RPD did not note any contradictions in his testimony. He notes that the RPD had expected him to submit a letter, an email or a photograph to establish the existence of his former friend. He submits that it was one night only in the circumstances and he cannot be expected to have the evidence the RPD requested. He asserts that he had proven the existence of his former friend through the child's birth certificate filed in support of his refugee protection claim.\n[21] I note that the RPD acknowledged the existence of the appellant's former friend through the child's birth certificate. That said, I see no errors by the RPD and I am of the opinion that it is of no use to respond to the appellant's submissions, which I consider theoretical given the RPD's favourable conclusion in this regard.\n[22] With respect to the appellant's allegations that his agent of harm was XXXX XXXX, his former friend's maternal uncle, the RPD noted that the XXXX is a public figure in the Republic of the Congo's political sphere, as demonstrated by the evidence submitted in support of the refugee protection claim.13 Other than establishing his influence, the RPD was of the opinion that the appellant did not provide any evidence on the existence of a family connection between his former friend and the XXXX, nor the XXXX involvement in the conflict with him and his family, nor with respect to the outcome of his scholarship.\n[23] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant questions what the RPD could normally expect him to have as evidence to prove the family connection between his former friend and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He submits that he is unable to obtain such evidence without jeopardizing his life. He argues that his father's statement submitted in evidence establishes the family connection between the XXXX and his former friend.\n[24] I cannot concur with the appellant's submissions. First, I note that the burden of proof rests on the appellant, who must prove his allegations on a balance of probabilities. I have reviewed the evidence submitted by the appellant about the identification of the agent of harm14 and I have no reason to doubt his existence. However, I note that the appellant's refugee protection claim is based substantially on his refusal to acknowledge the birth of the child and the threats made by the XXXX, as the former friend's uncle, against the appellant and his family members. The appellant submits that his father's statement confirms this family connection. However, I note that the RPD correctly gave little weight to this statement. I will come back to this. The appellant does not explain how his life could be jeopardized by trying to obtain evidence on the family connection in question when he made no effort in this regard. That said, I am of the opinion that the appellant's testimony alone is not sufficient to justify the lack of evidence proving the family connection between the XXXX and the former friend.\n[25] The RPD noted that the appellant produced a sworn statement from his father.15 It considered that the statement could be given very little weight only, because it is based on the appellant's own written account and contains contradictions that disqualify it. When he was questioned about whether he had considered using DNA tests, the appellant stated the following: [translation] \"at that time, I don't know if that is done in my country the Congo.\"16 In the sworn statement, the appellant's father stated the following: [translation] \"my son had therefore maintained his position of not acknowledging, before any potential paternity tests.\"17 [Emphasis added] The RPD considered that there is a contradiction between the appellant's testimony and his father's statement.\n[26] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant submits that the RPD erred in giving no weight to his father's statement and asserts that it contains no contradictions. He argues that this statement supports his assertions that he does not want to acknowledge the child because knowing that these tests are not very available, he gave this excuse as a condition, which allegedly allowed him to uphold his decision to not acknowledge the child.\n[27] I cannot concur with the appellant's submissions. Like the RPD, I note that the appellant's testimony contradicts the information in his father's sworn statement with regard to the non-availability of DNA tests in the Republic of the Congo. The appellant does not satisfactorily explain why he did not request DNA tests when he could have done so to support his refusal to acknowledge the child, especially since his father's statement confirms, at the very least, the existence or availability of such a test in the Republic of the Congo. I note that, at the appeal stage, the appellant may not address the fact that he gave [translation] \"an excuse as a condition\" [the non-availability of DNA tests] to uphold his decision to not acknowledge the child. At the risk of repeating myself, the appellant did not discharge his burden of demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities, that DNA tests were not available in the Republic of the Congo. All in all, I am of the opinion that the contradiction remains, and that the father's statement does not corroborate the appellant's allegations, at least in terms of DNA tests.\n[28] The RPD noted that the appellant's brother, a Canadian citizen, has been living in Montr\u00e9al since 2013, and was of the opinion that he might be aware of the appellant's fears or apprehensions while waiting for his scholarship and the thought of a potential return to the Republic of the Congo. The RPD noted that the appellant did not submit any statement or affidavit from the brother in support of his refugee protection claim. When questioned about this failure, the appellant stated that the brother did not know about the events that occurred in the Republic of the Congo.18\n[29] The RPD found that the appellant's explanations were vague and implausible in the circumstances, knowing that these alleged problems affected not only the appellant but all of the family members as well since he alleges in his written account, as the father did in his statement, that the XXXX threatened to arrest them. In light of the evidence, the RPD was of the opinion that the entire family had to have experienced the XXXX's blackmail for a certain period and, knowing that the appellant's brother is well settled in Montr\u00e9al, it is inconceivable that the family never discussed the threatening situation for them or the appellant in the Republic of the Congo. It found that the appellant's credibility was undermined.\n[30] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant submits that he explained at the hearing that his brother has been in Canada since 2013 and that he could therefore not testify about his problems in the Republic of the Congo. He submits that this evidence was instead considered to be hearsay.\n[31] I cannot concur with the appellant's submissions. First, I note that the RPD is not bound by formal rules of evidence and can therefore admit hearsay evidence.19 The RPD confirms this principle in its reasons, with respect to the existence of the former friend.20 It is therefore insufficient to argue that submitting a written statement from the brother could have been considered as hearsay evidence. The appellant could have submitted such evidence before the RPD so that it could assess its reliability and weight. The appellant's failure in this regard does not help his submissions.\n[32] As to the matter of what would motivate the XXXX to persecute him in 2021, the RPD noted that the appellant alleged the following in his written account: [Translation] \"...the XXXX men...they were threatening my family to tell me to go and acknowledge this child myself, otherwise misfortune might befall me.\"21 Considering the acknowledgement of paternity as submitted in evidence by the appellant, as well as the admission that his parents and\/or his family have not had any problems in the Republic of the Congo since then,22 the RPD questioned the appellant about why he would be arrested if he were to return to that country, to which he responded that it was because he mistreated the XXXX niece and that this is an insult to him.23\n[33] The RPD was of the opinion that if the XXXX still had a vendetta against the appellant and\/or his family, the family would not be able to live in peace, whereas the evidence shows that since the acknowledgement of the child, they have had no further threats or problems.\n[34] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant submits that he had stated that the XXXX wants him to personally acknowledge the child's paternity. The fact that the XXXX froze his scholarship, and the fact that the paternity refusal comes from him, namely someone considered to be of an inferior cast or ethnicity, make it such that if he were to return to his country, he would always be the subject of mistreatment. He stated that the XXXX did not want a DNA test performed, that agreeing to the late declaration occurred under duress and that he still has doubts about the paternity. The fact that acknowledging the paternity did not occur naturally but under duress is an insult. He submits that the XXXX is after him because his niece, who is like his daughter, was mistreated by a national from the south.\n[35] I note that the appellant is simply repeating his allegations and submissions at the hearing. The appellant is not specifically challenging the RPD's conclusion that the absence of any problems since acknowledging paternity brought an end to the alleged fear. Like the RPD, I note that the appellant's allegations in his written account allude to his fear related to the failure to acknowledge the child's paternity. While the acknowledgement of the child occurred by way of the appellant's father, according to his allegations, a condition for not causing the appellant misfortune, the fact remains that the appellant stated that his family has not had any problems since the acknowledgement. To argue that the XXXX is after the appellant by reason of his mistreatment of his niece and his ethnicity are, in my opinion, speculations. Furthermore, nothing in the evidence indicated that the XXXX would have refused to allow the appellant to undergo DNA testing. This allegation is not based on the evidence on the record. All in all, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in its conclusion, which I consider correct.\n[36] With respect to the Republic of the Congo scholarship, the RPD noted that the appellant submitted no evidence of its rejection, termination, cancellation, etc.; he only went as far as to speculate based on hearsay, from his father, that the XXXX boasted that he was able to freeze the scholarship. It noted that in his testimony, the appellant acknowledged right away that it was very difficult to obtain this type of scholarship and that his father's situation as an advisor to the country's presidency as well as his status at a prestigious university allowed him to take advantage of a network, thereby giving him access to this type of benefit, namely a scholarship. It noted that the appellant does not come from a marginal family, but from a family that moves among the upper echelons of the state, and in its opinion, [translation] \"it is too easy to speculate and claim that the scholarship was frozen when there is no document on the simple assertion that it is a corrupt state, when the scholarship was obtained on the basis of privilege and so favouritism or corruption depending on the preferred term, nothing was standing in the way of sending a cancellation letter with no further explanation.\" It noted that the appellant did not produce any correspondence supporting the alleged freezing of his scholarship, nor any follow-up on his part or in his name that could have been expected in the circumstances if he had truly been in this situation. It considered that the appellant did not discharge his burden of proof, limiting himself to pure speculations considering that it was up to him to demonstrate the efforts made to shed light on, if not clarify, his own situation. In the absence of evidence and a reasonable explanation, it found that the appellant's credibility was undermined.\n[37] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant submits that his father's statement does not contain hearsay evidence.\n[38] I do not need to address the issue of whether or not it was hearsay. What has to be determined is whether the appellant discharged his burden of proof with respect to obtaining evidence about the freezing of his scholarship. Like the RPD, I note that the appellant testified about the difficulty of obtaining a scholarship and the opportunity of having obtained it through the contacts of his father who, according to his allegations, held a important position in the government and gives courses at a prestigious university.24 In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that it was open to the RPD to require corroborative evidence, especially since it notes doubts about the appellant's credibility. It was also open to the RPD to expect evidence to be submitted to demonstrate the alleged freezing of the scholarship. All in all, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in its conclusion, which I consider correct.\nPresumption of state protection\n[39] At the hearing, the appellant stated that the XXXX had succeeded in freezing his scholarship, that he is a powerful man and that it would be surprising for the state to go against him.25\n[40] In the absence of a request for protection, knowing as well that the alleged dispute is apolitical and stems from events related to the private life of a citizen, and knowing that the appellant's family is one that operates at the highest levels of society and\/or the state, the RPD was of the opinion that the appellant's response was not sufficient to rebut the presumption of the state, notwithstanding the human rights record in the Republic of the Congo. It was of the opinion that a complaint to the police or requesting protection did not further jeopardize the appellant's safety or that of his family in the circumstances, knowing that the XXXX was already their enemy, personally, and not the state. It concluded that no evidence was actually submitted to rebut the presumption that in a private dispute with a high-ranking military officer, considering the appellant is also from a prominent family, it was not established that the state would have refused him protection.\n[41] In his appeal memorandum, the appellant submits that the objective evidence indicates that in the Congo, corruption is widespread in the state.26 He relies on the National Documentation Package27 to state that the XXXX is a government official, and the evidence is clear and convincing that the government of the Congo takes limited steps to prosecute or punish officials who have committed abuses, and that official impunity is a problem. Crimes involving violence or threats of violence are more targeted at indigenous peoples, and the Congo is divided into the Laari and Vili, as discussed in the objective evidence.28 Therefore, the appellant cannot objectively expect the state to protect him from one of its officers. He argues that the presumption that the state is able to protect him is rebutted.\n[42] While I agree that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted, the fact remains that the appellant's credibility was greatly undermined and the RPD's negative findings with respect to the appellant's credibility are sufficiently supported and determinative to conclude that the appeal be dismissed.\n[43] All in all and after reviewing all of the evidence, I find that the appellant is not credible and that the RPD did not err in its decision, which I consider correct.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD's determination that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nToni Jedid\nToni Jedid\nApril 11, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX (the appellant) is a citizen of Haiti. He is appealing two decisions of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD): the first issued on May 28, 2021, after a hearing on April 20, 2021, dismissing the application for a stay of proceedings; and the second dated November 19, 2021, after a hearing on October 14, 2021, declaring the appellant excluded from refugee protection under section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The appellant alleges a fear of persecution should he return to Haiti because of events that unfolded in 2013, when he was attacked after a broadcast of the show that he hosted. He left Haiti to seek asylum in the United States, where his application for asylum was rejected by the authorities. He apparently lived there without status until 2017, when he crossed the border at Roxham Road to claim refugee protection in Canada.\n[3] When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested the appellant at Roxham Road, a routine investigation revealed two videos on his cellphone containing child pornography. In the first video, the RCMP report describes a one-year-old whose penis is being kissed by a stuffed toy. The second video shows a little girl, about three years old, being sexually assaulted by an adult male. The constable consulted the appropriate authorities to find out whether criminal action would be taken against the appellant. After receiving a negative reply, the RCMP ordered the appellant to delete the videos and do a factory reset.\n[4] Before the RPD, the Minister intervened to request that the appellant be excluded based on Article 1F(b) of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the Convention) on the ground that he committed a serious non-political crime before entering Canada. On April 7, 2021, the appellant filed an application for a stay of proceedings before the RPD asking it to refuse to hear the exclusion raised by the Minister based on the abuse of process by the RCMP officers, who allegedly breached their duty to preserve evidence when they asked him to delete the videos and do a factory reset. The RPD dismissed the application on May 28, 2021, as it considered that it did not have jurisdiction to order a stay of proceedings.1 It also concluded, on applying the criteria in Babos,2 that public interest weighed heavily in favour of pursuing the Minister's exclusion request, as possession of child pornography is a heinous crime against children and, therefore, it is in the public's interest that this matter be resolved on its merits.\n[5] In its decision on the merits, the RPD sided with the Minister and concluded that the appellant must be excluded from protection. To arrive at that conclusion, it applied the principles set out in Febles to determine that possession of child pornography was a very serious crime warranting the appellant's exclusion under Article 1F(b) of the Convention.3\n[6] The Minister did not intervene in the appeal. The appellant submitted that the RPD erred in the adjudication of both the interlocutory application and the decision on the merits. In the application for a stay of proceedings, the appellant used the same arguments as in the first proceeding. He reiterated that the RCMP had a duty to preserve the evidence and that failing to do so was a breach of section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter), preventing him from making full answer and defence. He also argued that the RPD conducted a superficial analysis of the context by displaying a much too generous attitude toward the RCMP. With respect to the decision on the merits, he continued to argue that the first video did not show explicit sexual activity, as defined by the Supreme Court in Sharpe, and that, concerning the second video, he did not have the mens rea required for the alleged crime, namely, possession of child pornography, as he believed that he had previously deleted the video from his cellphone.\n[7] I am of the opinion that the RPD was correct to conclude that the application for a stay of proceedings had to be dismissed. However, I consider that it erred when it concluded that the appellant must be excluded under Article 1F(b) of the Convention.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The appeal is allowed. I refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination.\nANALYSIS\n[9] My role is to examine all the evidence, including the audio recording of the hearing, and determine whether the RPD's decision is correct.4\nThe appeal against the interlocutory decision to dismiss the application for a stay of proceedings\nThe Refugee Protection Division erred with respect to its lack of jurisdiction to decide the application\n[10] In its decision, the RPD first stated that the panel had jurisdiction to hear any application filed in this matter that is not explicitly set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules (RPD Rules). However, it sided with the Minister, who argued that his intervention was fully permitted under paragraph 170(e) of the IRPA, and therefore the stay of proceedings could not be ordered. The panel also stated that it was required to analyze the possibility of an exclusion, whether or not it was raised by the Minister, because of the inquisitorial nature of the panel's role. The RPD also stated that the case law indicates that, as per this inquisitorial role, the Board is not limited by the pleadings of the parties if the evidence reveals the existence of different or additional elements. The RPD was of the opinion that the application for a stay of proceedings must be dismissed for those reasons alone.\n[11] I cannot agree with that position. I am of the opinion that the RPD erred in confusing a stay of proceedings as a remedy for an abuse of process by the Minister with the parties' ability to act or the panel's responsibility to raise issues proprio motu under the legislation and regulations. In my view, these are two distinct notions.\n[12] The RPD had jurisdiction to rule on the appellant's application for a stay of proceedings. As the RPD stated at the start of its reasoning, rule 69 of the RPD Rules allows the panel to deal with any matter that is not specifically provided. This authority was also provided in Prassad, where the Supreme Court states as follows:\nWe are dealing here with the powers of an administrative tribunal in relation to its procedures. As a general rule, these tribunals are considered to be masters in their own house. In the absence of specific rules laid down by statute or regulation, they control their own procedures subject to the proviso that they comply with the rules of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice. Adjournment of their proceedings is very much in their discretion.5 [Emphasis added]\n[13] The Supreme Court recently reiterated in Abrametz that the doctrine of abuse of process in administrative law is rooted in a court's inherent and residual discretion to prevent abuse of its process.6 The jurisdiction of the RPD, and therefore also of the RAD, stems from its duty to ensure procedural fairness of the proceeding.\n[14] In Shen, the Federal Court implicitly recognized the RPD's jurisdiction to decide a stay of proceedings as a remedy for an abuse of process in the most extreme cases involving a breach of the duty of candour by the Minister:\nThe RPD must then consider the adequacy of the Crown's explanation. If no explanation is forthcoming, then the RPD may draw an adverse inference and must state clearly what that inference is. If the evidence establishes, or an inference is drawn, that the Crown's withholding of relevant and exculpatory documents was deliberate, then this will amount to a breach of the duty of candour and the RPD must consider whether it also constitutes an abuse of process. If the answer is yes, then the RPD must fashion an appropriate remedy, bearing in mind that a stay of proceedings or equivalent remedy will be justified only in the \"clearest of cases\" (Fabbiano v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1219 at para 9).7 [Emphasis added]\n[15] Therefore, I am of the opinion that the RPD erred in stating that it did not have jurisdiction to address the application for a stay of proceedings in a quasi-legal proceeding.\n[16] Alternatively, the RPD also decided the application on its merits. I will therefore assess whether the application of law and assessment of credibility were correct in its analysis.\nThe Refugee Protection Division correctly concluded that the application for a stay of proceedings must be dismissed\n[17] The RPD was of the opinion that deleting data from the appellant's telephone and destroying evidence did not amount to serious negligence. Relying on Babos, supra, it considered that the RCMP constables did not act rashly or maliciously in ordering the appellant to delete the videos from his cellphone, given that they were unaware of the potential consequences that such an order might have. The RCMP therefore acted in good faith, while preventing the commission of a crime in Canada. The panel was also of the opinion that the RCMP took reasonable action to determine the relevance of the evidence should criminal proceedings be initiated. It was therefore of the opinion that the RCMP was not required to anticipate a future intervention by the Minister requesting that the appellant be excluded from refugee protection, as the RCMP's presence at the border was temporary, the main purpose being to assist the border officers.\n[18] The RPD rejected the appellant's claims that the destruction of evidence made it impossible for him to defend himself against the Minister's allegations. The RPD was of the opinion that he did not provide the necessary evidence to substantiate the claim that it was possible for him to recover the data from the cloud. It concluded that, on applying the criteria in Babos, public interest weighed in favour of pursuing the Minister's request for exclusion, as the public interest in question concerned the protection of children, society's most vulnerable individuals.\n[19] On appeal, the appellant alleged that the destruction of evidence by RCMP officers amounted to an abuse of process. He argued that, in La, the Supreme Court stated that the duty to disclose includes a duty to preserve relevant evidence. If the loss of evidence is the result of unacceptable negligence, then the Crown has breached its duty to disclose, leading to a violation of section 7 of the Charter. He argued that the RPD conducted a superficial analysis of the circumstances surrounding the loss of the videos, displaying a much too generous attitude toward the RCMP by stating that it acted in good faith. Citing the Supreme Court in Babos, he argued that the conduct of the state authorities in this case amounted to an abuse of process, which falls under the category of the \"clearest of cases\" warranting a stay of proceedings to preserve and protect the integrity of the justice system.\n[20] In Blencoe, the Supreme Court defined abuse of process in administrative proceedings as follows:\nIn order to find an abuse of process, the court must be satisfied that, \"the damage to the public interest in the fairness of the administrative process should the proceeding go ahead would exceed the harm to the public interest in the enforcement of the legislation if the proceedings were halted\" (Brown and Evans, supra, at p. 9-68). According to L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. in Power, supra, at p. 616, \"abuse of process\" has been characterized in the jurisprudence as a process tainted to such a degree that it amounts to one of the clearest of cases. In my opinion, this would apply equally to abuse of process in administrative proceedings. For there to be abuse of process, the proceedings must, in the words of L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J., be \"unfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice\" (p. 616). \"Cases of this nature will be extremely rare\" (Power, supra, at p. 616). In the administrative context, there may be abuse of process where conduct is equally oppressive.8 [Emphasis added]\n[21] In this case, the alleged behaviour of the state authorities did not concern delays, but rather the Crown's duty to disclose that, in criminal law, was said to result in a correlative duty to preserve evidence. As the appellant cited, in La the Supreme Court held that failure to meet this duty of preservation requires the Crown to provide an acceptable explanation, otherwise the result could be a breach of section 7 of the Charter or an abuse of process:\nThis obligation to explain arises out of the duty of the Crown and the police to preserve the fruits of the investigation. The right of disclosure would be a hollow one if the Crown were not required to preserve evidence that is known to be relevant. Yet despite the best efforts of the Crown to preserve evidence, owing to the frailties of human nature, evidence will occasionally be lost. The principle in Stinchcombe (No. 2), supra, recognizes this unfortunate fact. Where the Crown's explanation satisfies the trial judge that the evidence has not been destroyed or lost owing to unacceptable negligence, the duty to disclose has not been breached. Where the Crown is unable to satisfy the judge in this regard, it has failed to meet its disclosure obligations, and there has accordingly been a breach of s. 7 of the Charter. Such a failure may also suggest that an abuse of process has occurred, but that is a separate question. It is not necessary that an accused establish abuse of process for the Crown to have failed to meet its s. 7 obligation to disclose.9 [Emphasis added]\n[22] In Shen, supra, the Federal Court applied these principles of evidence disclosure in criminal law directly to proceedings before this panel. However, the Court did not rule on how this duty applies to administrative proceedings in refugee law, namely, whether it corresponds to the duty set out for criminal proceedings.\n[23] Proceedings before an administrative tribunal must be flexible and carried out expeditiously. I am of the opinion that the principle stated in La, namely, that a duty to preserve arises from the duty to disclose, should be applied in both criminal and administrative law; there is no reason to distinguish between the different areas of law in this respect. However, the duty to disclose, and its corollary duty to preserve, do not apply the same way to administrative law as to criminal or penal proceedings, where the procedural rules are much more rigid in order to comply with the many constitutional procedural rights of the accused. Moreover, this distinction between criminal and administrative matters is consistent with the distinction repeatedly expressed by the Supreme Court.10 It is also worth pointing out that, according to La, supra, this duty to preserve stems from the application of section 7 of the Charter.11 However, the Supreme Court clearly stated that section 7 of the Charter has no bearing on the interpretation of section 98 of the IRPA; constitutional guarantees relating to the right to life, liberty and security are considered premature, but will become relevant in the pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA).12\n[24] Before this panel, my duty to disclose instead stems from principles of procedural fairness. With respect to the duty to disclose in the context of an exclusion under Article 1F, Justice Iacobucci, writing for the Supreme Court, stated that this duty stems from the application of the principle of natural justice:\nIn general, included in the requirements of procedural fairness is the right to disclosure by the administrative decision-maker of sufficient information to permit meaningful participation in the hearing process: In re Canadian Radio-Television Commission and in re London Cable TV Ltd., 1976 CanLII 2305 (FCA), [1976] 2 F.C. 621 (C.A.), at pp. 624-25. The extent of the disclosure required to meet the dictates of natural justice will vary with the facts of the case, and in particular with the type of decision to be made, and the nature of the hearing to which the affected parties are entitled.13 [Emphasis added]\n[25] Regarding the extent of this obligation in administrative law, I consider the Federal Court case Seyoboba to be instructive.14 Citing the Court of Appeal in Siad, Justice Montigny explains the content of the duty to disclose in the context of exclusion proceedings, the Minister owes a duty to disclose relevant information:\nOne must never lose sight of the fact that the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board is an administrative tribunal with specialized knowledge, not bound by legal or technical rules of evidence. As a result, the disclosure standards delineated in Stinchcombe do not necessarily apply automatically in the context of a refugee hearing and may require some adaptation. On the other hand, I agree with the applicant that the level of disclosure owed to an applicant cannot be decided by a simple invocation of the distinction between criminal and administrative proceedings, and that the consequences of an adverse finding on the applicant must be taken into consideration. ...\nOn the basis of the five factors found to be relevant in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, in determining the content of the duty of fairness in a particular set of circumstances, I am prepared to accept that an applicant is entitled to a high degree of procedural fairness in a proceeding to vacate his refugee status based on alleged omissions of participation in war crimes and crimes against humanity. I rely for that finding more particularly on the consequences for the applicant to be branded as a war criminal, and on the adversarial nature of such a proceeding. Indeed, the Federal Court of Appeal came to that very conclusion in the context of a finding of exclusion based on Article 1F(a) and (c) of the Convention, and opined that it entails the obligation for the Minister to disclose relevant information...15 [citations omitted, emphasis added]\n[26] It is therefore my view that, before ruling on the issue as to whether the Crown violated its duty to disclose, the RPD had to deal with the content of the duty in the context of quasi-judicial proceedings before the panel in light of the circumstances of the case.\n[27] In this case, it is my view that the content of the duty to disclose, and thus to preserve, is significant given the serious social stigma for the appellant, associated with the label of pedophile and the adversarial nature of the proceedings before the panel.\n[28] Because the exclusion based on Article 1F(b) of the Convention was raised, the Minister had to share the information he had in support of his allegations, which he did. Indeed, when the decision was made to raise the exclusion, at the time of the Minister's intervention on July 31, 2018, after the refugee protection claim was filed on October 5, 2017, the videos were no longer available. Therefore, the Minister never had the opportunity to view the videos in the context of the proceedings and is relying only on the reports supporting his allegation. The panel must therefore assess whether the reports were sufficient to allow the appellant to be apprised of the facts and information alleged against him and whether he had the opportunity \"to present [his] case fully and fairly.\"16\n[29] It is clear that, the Minister considers that he does not need to submit the videos into evidence to discharge his burden of proof, namely, having \"serious reasons for considering\" that the appellant committed the alleged act before entering Canada. This standard of proof is much lower than that provided under criminal law, which requires a standard of proof that is \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" For his part, the appellant has a range of means of proof available to defend himself against these allegations, given that the means of proof before the panel need not adhere to any procedural formality.\n[30] The appellant argues that the absence of videos deprives him of two essential defences:\n(1) That the dominant characteristic of the images in the first video is not of a sexual nature;\n(2) That he did not have the mens rea required to want to possess the second video, since he believed that he had already deleted it from his telephone, and that the video data would have revealed the number of times he viewed the video, and the moment he saved it and received it on his cellphone.\n[31] In my view, the absence of the videos does not deprive the appellant of a defence in the circumstances. In fact, the appellant did not explain how his allegations could not be supported by other evidence, either testimonial or technological. He further alleges that his wife shared with him the second video of the sexual assault on a three-year-old child to show him how vile people can be. Yet the appellant did not file any affidavit from his wife in an attempt to corroborate this statement before the RPD, even though she testified in the proceedings before the Immigration Division (ID). Moreover, after being informed that it would be possible to find the data in the cloud by means of the digital report dated December 15, 2017, the appellant took no steps in this regard.17 I also note that the appellant testified having received the second video via WhatsApp from his wife. Thus, she may have kept the data from the messages sent from her telephone to her husband's. Lastly, the appellant failed to demonstrate that it was impossible for him to retrieve the data from his WhatsApp account, which exists independently of his cellphone, in order to retrieve his data: the appellant made no efforts in this regard. The appellant had the opportunity to provide evidence in other ways, but he chose not to.\n[32] In my view, the absence of these videos deprives the Minister of means of proof that only the appellant can provide through his testimony or other evidence, such as the number of times he viewed the video, how he received them or even the dominant pornographic character of the first video. When analyzing the evidence submitted by the Minister, the panel must be careful not to make factual inferences that are not supported by these reports, while ensuring that the principles of procedural fairness are applied to the appellant. The appellant was thus able to understand the facts and information alleged against him based on the reports, and I consider that the panel gave him the opportunity to \"present [his] case fully and fairly.\" Consequently, I believe that the Minister did not have the duty to preserve the videos as evidence as a corollary of his duty to disclose, which, in my view, has already been met through providing the police reports on which his allegations are based; and that the appellant continues to have access to several other effective pieces of evidence to support his defences.\n[33] In conclusion, I am of the opinion that the Minister violated neither section 7 of the Charter nor the principles of fairness by not preserving the videos in question and that, therefore, there was no abuse of process. In my view, the RPD correctly concluded that the application for a stay of proceedings should be dismissed.\nAppeal of the decision excluding the appellant under Article 1F(b) of the Convention\n[34] The Minister alleges that he has serious reasons for considering that, before the appellant arrived in Canada, he committed the criminal offence under paragraph 163.1(4)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada, namely, possession of child pornography. He also alleges that this crime contains an element of seriousness as defined in Article 1F(b) of the Convention, thereby excluding him, under section 98 of the IRPA, from the refugee status and protection provided under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.\n[35] The RPD concluded that the two videos should be designated child pornography in light of Sharpe and that the appellant had them on his telephone before he entered Canada. The panel was of the opinion that, based on the test in Jayasekara, the crime committed by the appellant was serious, as defined in Article 1F(b) of the Convention, and that the appellant was therefore excluded from protection.\nFirst video (baby with a plush teddy bear)\n[36] The appellant disputes the characterization of the first video by the RPD. He essentially makes the same arguments as those submitted before the RPD, namely that, without the opportunity to view the video, it is impossible to decide whether it contains pornographic content, as defined in Sharpe. He further argues that the video content has been described in different ways by the representatives of the parties. According to the appellant, the first video was humorous in nature and did not depict a child exposed in explicit sexual activity. He contends that, in Sharpe, the Supreme Court states that \"explicit sexual activity\" should be given a restrained interpretation, a guideline that was ignored by the RPD, which in his view failed to consider the nonsexual circumstances of the video, namely, that the child was playing alone with a teddy bear in a casual and harmless way. Lastly, the appellant disputes the RPD's conclusion that the video was found in a file that contained numerous other pornographic videos, given that, following the factory reset, this observation cannot be proven. The RPD was of the opinion that, based on the RCMP officers' description, the video clearly depicted intimate sexual activity, as there is no other context in which [translation] \"having one's penis kissed\" does not carry sexual connotations. It added that, based on the ID decision of June 19, 2018, the video was in a file that contained several other pornographic videos.\n[37] I note that the RPD relied on considerations raised by the ID as evidence, which in my view is an error. The RPD should have first assessed the evidence before it in order to assess the appellant's credibility, and not rely on the assessment carried out by an ID officer.\n[38] However, this error has no impact. The appellant testified that the videos in dispute were in an area of his cellphone that required a different access password.18 That his cellphone contained several adult pornography videos is not contested. Moreover, and contrary to his argument on appeal, the appellant confirmed at the hearing that the video description provided by the RCMP officers in their report corresponds to the video in question, namely, a boy of about one to two years old whose penis was out of his pants and being touched by a toy.19 The various descriptions of the different stakeholders, namely, his lawyer or the Minister's representative, do not constitute evidence and are therefore irrelevant.\n[39] In Sharpe, the Supreme Court ruled that for the purposes of section 163.1 of the Criminal Code, the expression \"explicit sexual activity\" taken from the definition of child pornography must be defined as follows:\nI conclude that \"explicit sexual activity\" refers to acts which viewed objectively fall at the extreme end of the spectrum of sexual activity - acts involving nudity or intimate sexual activity, represented in a graphic and unambiguous fashion, with persons under or depicted as under 18 years of age. The law does not catch possession of visual material depicting only casual sexual contact, like touching, kissing, or hugging, since these are not depictions of nudity or intimate sexual activity. Certainly, a photo of teenagers kissing at summer camp will not be caught. At its furthest reach, the section might catch a video of a caress of an adolescent girl's naked breast, but only if the activity is graphically depicted and unmistakably sexual. (For a discussion of such concerns see B. Blugerman and L. May, \"The New Child Pornography Law: Difficulties of Bill C-128\" (1995), 4 M.C.L.R. 17.)20 [emphasis added]\n[40] Like the RPD, I am of the opinion that the act of touching or [translation] \"kissing\" the penis of a young baby with a teddy bear corresponds to the definition of child pornography described by the Supreme Court. Also, the comments of the primary constable, namely that this video gave him [translation] \"reasons to believe that the telephone contained child pornography\" and not that the video itself constituted child pornography does not contradict this conclusion. In fact, this video does not have the same intensity as the second video that records the sexual assault of a young three-year-old girl by an adult man; however, it is explicit enough for the constables to associate the notion of child pornography with it. I am of the opinion that the RPD's analysis in paragraph 24 of its decision is correct in that the activity described in the video constitutes an explicit intimate sexual activity, especially when the sexual organ of the child is emphasized. The appellant did not dispute the allegation that he was in possession of this video when he was arrested at the Canadian border.\n[41] At the hearing, the appellant's counsel submitted that the Minister's representative had not filed into evidence that the possession of child pornography constituted a crime in the United States. The latter replied that, like in all countries in the world, the possession of child pornography is criminalized in the United States.21 I note that the appellant did not repeat this objection in his appeal, and therefore I conclude that he does not dispute that possessing this type of pornography is a crime in the United States. At any rate, the RPD was not required to assess whether the acts constituted crimes in the United States, but rather if the acts could be considered crimes under Canadian law at the time of the events.22\n[42] Even without the video, I am of the opinion that this evidence is sufficient to identify this video as capturing child pornography, through the observations made in writing by the officers. I am of the view that the lack of evidence with respect to the atmosphere and environment in which this video took place will carry all its weight in the assessment of the seriousness of the crime. Like the RPD, I am therefore of the opinion that the Minister has discharged his burden of establishing that there are serious reasons for considering that the appellant committed the crime of possessing child pornography when he was in the United States.\nSecond video (sexual assault of the little girl)\n[43] With respect to this video, the RPD concluded that the Minister had established that the appellant had been in possession of child pornography, within the meaning of section 163.1 of the Criminal Code, before he entered Canada. To arrive at this conclusion, the panel considered the following: (i) that it was not necessary to determine whether the appellant was aware that the video was still on his cellphone when he entered Canada, but rather that he was in possession of this video when he was in the United States; (ii) that the video had been easily accessible to the constable during the interview at the border; (iii) that the video was in a file that required a separate password to access it, indicating that it was in his possession; (iv) that the video had been stored in a file that included other pornographic videos; (v) that the appellant had apologized to the authorities during his arrest, asking if that would hurt his refugee protection claim; (vi) that the appellant contradicted himself on the number of times he had viewed the video and when he had deleted it.\n[44] The appellant does not deny that the video contains child pornography. However, he argues that the RPD erred and that his testimony was actually consistent with regard to his belief that he had deleted the video before entering Canada. He does not agree with paragraph 28 of the decision, which, according to him, attempts to minimize the significance of this belief. He argues that the fact that he deleted it demonstrates that he did not intend to preserve the video and therefore that he did not intend to possess it when he was in the United States. He maintains that the evidence destroyed by the RCMP would have provided the information to determine this aspect of the crime, including the number of times the video was viewed, and when it was saved, deleted or sent to his cellphone. He submits that the RPD's reasoning is unreasonable in paragraph 30 of the decision, where it indicates that the presence of the video on the cellphone contradicts the statement that it had been deleted. According to him, the physical presence of the video on the device is insufficient to rebut his allegation that he honestly believed that he had deleted it, because files can be stored in all kinds of ways on such smart phones, even without such an intent by the owner. He highlights the passages from the hearing during which the member acknowledged being incompetent in cellphone matters, stating that a knowledge of cellphones was required to assess whether the video was saved on the device. He is also of the opinion that the RPD erred in its analysis of paragraph 31 of the decision, given that the presence of other legal pornographic videos in the file does not mean that the appellant was aware that this video in particular was among the others. The fact that he protected the file with a password also does not mean that he was aware that this controversial video was under his control: the presence of other legal pornographic videos can legitimize the intention of controlling access to the file. In addition, the fact that he apologized to the officers cannot lead to the assumption of illegal possession of this video. He also criticizes the lack of thoroughness in the analysis at paragraph 35 of the decision, identifying a so-called inconsistency that does not reflect the testimonial evidence of the file with respect to the deletion of this video. He alleges that the member exhibited a hostile attitude toward him by not giving him the opportunity to explain himself, revealing a bias toward the appellant. He pleads Morelli to argue that he did not have possession of the video based on the case law criteria. Lastly, he argues that having provided the passwords to the constables demonstrates that he did not have the attitude of someone hiding illegal videos on his telephone.\n[45] The appellant does not dispute the child pornographic nature of this video. As he did before the RPD or even the ID, the appellant alleges that he believed he had deleted the video and therefore that he did not have the mens rea required for him to be found [translation] \"in possession\" of child pornography.\n[46] Pursuant to Morelli regarding the possession of child pornography on a computer, the Supreme Court of Canada defines the notion of \"personal possession\" as follows:\n[15] For the purposes of the Criminal Code, \"possession\" is defined in s. 4(3) to include personal possession, constructive possession, and joint possession. Of these three forms of culpable possession, only the first two are relevant here. It is undisputed that knowledge and control are essential elements common to both.\n[16] On an allegation of personal possession, the requirement of knowledge comprises two elements: the accused must be aware that he or she has physical custody of the thing in question, and must be aware as well of what that thing is. Both elements must co-exist with an act of control (outside of public duty): Beaver v. The Queen, 1957 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1957] S.C.R. 531, at pp. 541-42.23 [emphasis added]\n[47] The fact that the video was on the appellant's telephone when he entered the country is not disputed. He supports that he was unaware of the presence of the video on his telephone because he believed he had deleted it.\n[48] The Minister had the burden of proof and therefore had to establish that the presence of the video led to serious reasons for considering that the appellant was aware and had control of the video, a standard lower than the balance of probabilities.24 However, the appellant repeatedly declared that he was unaware of the video's presence on his telephone, an allegation made under oath, resulting in the presumption of truthfulness in accordance with Maldonado. This presumption is rebutted only when inconsistencies between the testimony and the rest of the evidence on the record are identified.25\n[49] I do not agree with the RPD that the video's presence on the telephone and the allegation of having deleted it are contradictory. For example, the appellant could have deleted it from Whatsapp, but the video was already automatically saved to a file on the telephone. Deleting the video from Whatsapp would therefore not have deleted it from the telephone's memory. The appellant had testified about this before the ID: [translation] \"when a video is viewed in Whatsapp, certain telephones automatically save it to the mobile telephone's video files.\"26\n[50] The illegal video was in the same file as the other saved pornographic videos under a separate password, according to the appellant's testimony.27 However, he denies having saved it there himself, which, in my opinion, fits with the possibility that the video was automatically saved to the telephone, a function offered by Whatsapp.28 I cannot see how having a password to restrict access to this file could have influenced this function; the Minister did not file any evidence to the contrary. I am of the opinion that the RPD erred in assuming that the appellant himself had saved and stored the video in that file, which is contrary to the evidence and reveals a lack of computer knowledge. The analysis in paragraphs 30 and 31 of the decision is incorrect.\n[51] I do not agree with the analysis in paragraph 32 of the decision. In his report, which is also succinct, Constable XXXX states that the appellant apologized, mentioning that the video was sent to him by his spouse.29 I am of the opinion that it is insufficient to conclude an admission of liability. The document does not relate the words verbatim; it is only a summary that may very well disregard other statements that would be exculpatory.\n[52] The analysis in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the decision about the number of times the appellant viewed the video is confusing: on the one hand, the RPD draws a negative inference as to the appellant's credibility regarding a perceived inconsistency, criticizing him for not having deleted the video after the first view, but on the other hand, the RPD states that the number of times the appellant viewed it is not relevant to the offence of possession of child pornography, which is false. I am of the opinion that the number of times the video was viewed can corroborate his allegations that he was unaware of the video's presence or, at least, be relevant to the severity of the sentence.\n[53] In his testimony before the RPD, he states that he watched the video twice, when he received it while he was at work and then when he returned to his residence thereafter.30 During his interview with a Canada Border Services Agency officer, the appellant mentioned [translation] \"not knowing if he had mentioned it more than once,\" referring to the video, specifying that he had been shocked when the officer showed it to him.31 Before the ID, he allegedly testified that he deleted the video [translation] \"immediately after watching it.\"32 However, the ID's decision indicates that the appellant declared to the member in charge of the detention review that he had watched the video twice, resulting in a contradiction undermining his credibility to the effect that he did not know that the videos were still on his telephone.\n[54] As for when he deleted the video, he testified that he deleted the video after he returned home, therefore after the second viewing.33 Before the ID, he allegedly stated that he deleted it immediately after watching it, as previously mentioned.\n[55] I am of the opinion that the discrepancy between the different testimonies is minor. I did not have the benefit of having access to his testimony before the ID, whose adverse finding as to the appellant's credibility remains the result of the member's interpretation, not of direct evidence such as his testimony before the PRD and the port-of-entry notes. I therefore conclude that the appellant was consistent on this issue and thus viewed the video twice, on a balance of probabilities. As the videos were not preserved, the Minister cannot provide any contrary or competing evidence in this regard. The evidence does not show if the appellant viewed the video in full each time: the appellant was not asked about this, and the technological evidence is not available. He stated that he had deleted it shortly after receiving it, which corroborates his testimony that he deleted it after he viewed it for the second time, the very same day. I am satisfied that the appellant's testimony retains the presumption of truthfulness in Maldonado.\n[56] However, I note that the appellant knew that videos could be automatically saved on his telephone when received and viewed via WhatsApp. I am of the opinion that, while it is possible that at the time of his arrest he no longer remembered that the video was on his telephone, L\u00e9vesque teaches that the concept of knowledge with respect to paragraph 163.1(4)(a) of the Criminal Code includes wilful blindness.34 I am therefore of the opinion that the appellant had custody of his telephone, which was under his control and contained a number of pornographic videos, that he was aware of the illegal content of the video and that he was reckless as to whether it had been saved on his telephone or not. Consequently, I am of the opinion that the appellant had knowledge, within the meaning of the case law, and custody of the video on his telephone and therefore was in possession of child pornography.\n[57] Consequently, I am of the opinion that the RPD correctly concluded that the Minister had discharged his burden of establishing that there were serious reasons for considering that the appellant had committed the offence under subsection 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, namely, that he was in possession of child pornography.\nThe Refugee Protection Division erred in its assessment of the seriousness of the offence\n[58] First, the RPD concluded that, in accordance with Febles, above, the crime of possession of child pornography set out in paragraph 163.1(4)(a) of the Criminal Code provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years, which makes it a generally serious crime. Applying the criteria in Jayasekara of the Federal Court of Appeal, the panel found that there were serious reasons for considering that the acts of which the appellant is accused constituted a serious non-political crime prior to entry to Canada.35 In arriving at this conclusion, the panel considered that: (i) the crime of possession of child pornography perpetuated a system of extremely violent and abusive child exploitation; (ii) he could be prosecuted by way of indictment or summary conviction; (iii) the attempt to minimize the pornographic aspect of the first video was an aggravating factor; and (iv) there were no mitigating circumstances on the record, noting that the child pornography industry is extremely harmful to children and that it exists because of consumers of this type of material.\n[59] The appellant alleges that the RPD erred in its assessment of the seriousness of the crime in question, by failing to consider the types of sentences that individuals who are convicted of possession of child pornography in Canada receive, in violation of the guidelines set out in Febles. He argues that the conclusion is contradicted by the decision of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ) not to lay criminal charges against him. He argues that the sentences in cases involving possession of child pornography are remarkably light, citing Bahamonde, which states that the number and nature of the images are important factors in determining the sentence. He submits that the alleged acts, if proven, would not result in the presumption of seriousness necessary to exclude him from refugee protection. Lastly, he argues that the RPD member erred in her assessment of the aggravating and mitigating factors, by demonstrating bias against him.\n[60] I agree with the appellant's arguments that the RPD erred in its assessment of the factors to determine the seriousness of the alleged offence. Furthermore, the member failed to consider the sentences handed down by Canada's criminal system for acts comparable to those in the appellant's case. In addition, I am of the opinion that the analysis of the criteria in Jayasekara is almost non-existent, and supplemented with observations about the harmful effect of child pornography on children, those most vulnerable in society, which the appellant does not refute. I will therefore conduct my own analysis, applying the jurisprudential factors.\n[61] In Jayasekara, the Federal Court of Appeal determined that to assess the seriousness of a crime within the meaning of Article 1F(b) of the Convention, the following factors must be considered: the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction.36\nElements of the crime\n[62] For it to constitute a crime, the Minister must prove the actus reus, namely, the possession of child pornography, and that the appellant had the mens rea of knowledge with respect to the custody and nature of the videos in question. The crime therefore does not involve production or distribution of the product. In this case, the Minister was able to prove that there were serious reasons for considering that the appellant had neglected to delete the video from his telephone, which constitutes knowledge in the legal sense of the term.\n[63] As stated by the RPD, this crime is of particular seriousness in terms of the damage to those most vulnerable in society. In the words of Sharpe, the possession of this material, while less harmful than production and distribution, \"contributes to the market for child pornography, a market which in turn drives production involving the exploitation of children.\"37\n[64] This analysis weighs in favour of the seriousness of the crime.\nThe mode of prosecution\n[65] Subsection 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code provides for a mixed mode of prosecution, either by indictable offence and imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years or by summary conviction that may result in imprisonment for a term of not more than two years or a minimum imprisonment for a term of six months. Imposing a minimum sentence indicates that Parliament considers this crime to be very serious. This also weighs in favour of the seriousness of the crime.\nMitigating and aggravating circumstances\n[66] The Quebec Court of Appeal recently upheld the Court of Quebec decision in Ibrahim, imposing concurrent sentences of 12 and 18 months for the respective possession and distribution of 807 videos and 11,038 images containing child pornography.38 To assess the seriousness of the accused's actions, the Court drew on the factors established in Chass\u00e9e:\n(1) The nature of the material and the degree of child pornography presented;\n(2) The expressive form used, i.e. photos, videos, drawings, etc.;\n(3) The amount of material accumulated and stored and the method of obtaining it (free or paid access);\n(4) The age of the children;\n(5) The intended use of the material;\n(6) The degree of danger the accused may pose to children.\n[67] The first video involving a baby with a plush teddy bear kissing his penis, which is out of his pants, corresponds to child pornography but does not involve any interaction with an adult or any other person. Without the video, it is impossible to determine whether the person filming the scene is speaking to the child. In addition, given that the video was not submitted into evidence, it is difficult to assess the circumstances of this interaction and the child's reaction. The video is only two minutes long. I am of the opinion that the seriousness of the nature of the video is at the lower end of the scale.\n[68] With regard to the second video recording a sexual assault on a three- to four-year-old girl, I am of the opinion that the degree of pornography is extremely high because it involves a man ejaculating on the little girl, who is forced to perform oral sex on him. Furthermore, according to the report, penetration may have occurred that was not captured on camera. I am of the opinion that the seriousness of the nature of the video is extremely high.\n[69] That said, a search of the appellant's cell phone did not reveal any other kind of child pornography, either in photograph or video format. The appellant testified that he received these videos via Whatsapp, therefore free of charge, and there is no evidence that he solicited them. There is no evidence that the appellant forwarded the material to anyone else. The intended use of this material is difficult to assess, but there is no evidence on the record that the appellant was a [translation] \"consumer\" of this type of pornography, rather it would appear that he is an adult pornography enthusiast considering the large number of videos of this type found on his telephone. Furthermore, he viewed the second video only twice, on a balance of probabilities. Based on the conclusions above, there is no evidence that the appellant himself saved it on his telephone. In my opinion, this shows that the appellant poses a very low degree of danger to children.\n[70] However, the children are of a very young age.\n[71] Without minimizing the seriousness of the harm caused to these children, which is among the most serious that can be committed against an individual, I am of the opinion that this crime, as committed by the appellant, would likely have been prosecuted by way of summary conviction and therefore would have resulted in imprisonment for a term of not more than two years. This is corroborated by the refusal of the authorities to prosecute the appellant in criminal court, given that the circumstances did not involve any production. An entry in the report by RCMP Constable XXXX, dated August 5, 2017, states the following: [translation] \"Received a call from XXXX XXXX from SQ. Following a discussion with Ms. XXXX, given that there was no production and he is not the one who made the video, they will not be getting involved.\" I agree with the appellant that this entry may indicate that, for the Canadian authorities, the degree of seriousness of the appellant's actions was not so high as to warrant their getting involved, although this lack of willingness to intervene may also reveal a lack of resources. I therefore conclude that the aggravating and mitigating circumstances weigh against the seriousness of the acts of which the appellant is accused.\nRange of possible sentences\n[72] For offences related to child pornography, the primary objective is to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation, considering that they are the most vulnerable members of society.39 The sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence are therefore prioritized.\n[73] For comparison, in Ibrahim, above, concurrent sentences of 12 and 18 months were handed down for the respective possession and distribution of 807 videos and 11,038 images containing child pornography. The accused was medical student; he was 32 years of age and single. In Bahamonde, cited by the appellant, the accused was convicted of 12 counts involving the sexual exploitation of children, including possession of child pornography. In that case, the evidence shows that the accused was in possession of 1,036 sexually explicit images of children and 111 videos that meet the definition of child pornography. On this count of possession, he was sentenced to two years of imprisonment.40 In R. v. Inksetter, the Ontario Court of Appeal sentenced an offender to three years for possession of 28,000 unique images and 1,000 videos of child pornography, involving bestiality.41 The Ontario Court of Appeal stated that the range of sentences for convictions of possession of child pornography was from six months to three years.42\n[74] I am therefore of the opinion, in the circumstances, that the seriousness of the appellant's actions is on the low end of the scale, as the mitigating circumstances include the very few items in the appellant's possession and the number of times viewed, which does not give him the profile of a habitual consumer of this type of pornography. The aggravating factors include the very young age of the children and the fact that this type of offence targets those most vulnerable in society. I am therefore of the opinion that, if he had been convicted of this offence in Canada, he would not have served a sentence of more than six months, that being the minimum sentence, which rebuts the presumption of seriousness. I am therefore of the opinion that the offence committed by the appellant before he entered Canada does not correspond to a serious non-political crime as defined in Article 1F(b) of the Convention. I note that the RAD reached the same conclusion in its decision in MB8-23057, dealing with similar circumstances.\n[75] I therefore conclude that the RPD erred in applying Article 1F(b) of the Convention and that the appellant is not excluded from protection under section 98 of the IRPA. I therefore refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination of the appellant's refugee protection claim with respect to his alleged fears if he were to return to Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[76] The appeal is allowed. I refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination of the refugee protection claim.\n(signed)\nMe Martine Durocher\nMe Martine Durocher\nAugust 15, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Interlocutory decision, May 28, 2021, at para. 26.\n2 R. v.

The appellant is contesting the RPD's analysis and asking the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow the appeal and declare the appellant to be a refugee.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] After conducting an independent analysis of all the evidence on the record, including the recording of the hearing, I am of the opinion that the RPD erred in concluding that the appellant did not establish a prospective risk in Haiti. I therefore set aside the decision of the RPD and determine that the appellant is a Convention refugee.\n[4] In reaching my decision, I considered Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, and Chairperson's Guideline 8: Concerning Procedures with Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n[5] The appeal is allowed.\nOVERVIEW\n[6] The appellant is a 56-year-old Haitian woman. She alleges that she was the victim of a burglary at her home, as well as an armed robbery at the market. She fears persecution in Haiti because of her membership in the particular social group of women.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[7] My role is to examine all the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct with respect to each error raised in the appellant's arguments.1\nANALYSIS\nPreliminary issue: new National Documentation Package\n[8] A new National Documentation Package (NDP) on Haiti was published on July 29, 2022, which was after the RPD decision. Given that the RAD considers there to have been significant changes in the objective evidence, the new package was disclosed to the appellant and the Minister, who were given the opportunity to make submissions on the issue of prospective risk. The appellant provided her submissions on October 18, 2022. No response was received from the Minister.\nThe appellant's vulnerability\n[9] The appellant argues that the RPD disregarded her application to be declared a vulnerable person due to her psychological condition by incorrectly stating that no such application had been made to the panel. The appellant submits that the RPD thereby failed to be sensitive to her particular circumstances, and treated her claim without being alert to the particular facts of the case. The appellant also argues that Guideline 8 states at section 7.4 that the panel may at any time act on its own initiative and accommodate the difficulties associated with the vulnerability of the person concerned.\n[10] In this regard, I note that counsel for the appellant did indeed raise her mental condition and memory problems at the beginning of the hearing, but did not apply for any specific accommodations in accordance with section 7.4 of Guideline 8. Moreover, according to the same section, counsel was required to make an application to that effect in writing under rule 50 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (RPD Rules) at least ten days before the hearing, which had not been done.\n[11] However, I note that the RPD did take into consideration the psychological report and the appellant's mental state. I note that when questioning the appellant, the member was sensitive to her difficulties with testifying, and often asked his questions more than once, giving her time to fully understand and respond to the question. He acted with sensitivity and respect, in accordance with section 10.1 of Guideline 8.\n[12] The RPD concluded that despite episodes of confusion and forgetfulness at the hearing, the appellant's credibility was not affected. I listened to the hearing and I agree that apart from the difficulties raised by the RPD, the appellant was able to present her evidence adequately without the need for further accommodations. I also note that on appeal, counsel does not clarify what other steps the RPD should have taken.\n[13] I therefore conclude that the member was alert to the appellant's specific circumstances at the hearing, and although he did not expressly declare the appellant to be vulnerable, it is apparent from the hearing as a whole that he was sensitive to her particular vulnerability arising from her mental state.\n[14] As explained below, I am of the view that the RPD's erred in its assessment of the objective evidence regarding the situation of women in Haiti, rather than in its assessment of the appellant's psychological profile.\nThe appellant's fear\n[15] The RPD concluded that the appellant's profile does not correspond to that of women described in the objective documentary evidence as most likely to be victims of gender-based persecution, since she can benefit from the male protection of her husband and has family support both within Haiti and elsewhere.\n[16] The appellant argues that in light of the substantiated statistics regarding rape and sexual assault found in the documentary evidence, the panel should have inferred the possibility of such violence given its prevalence against women, particularly in the context of robberies or kidnappings for ransom, but that the reasons do not make clear that this was done. The appellant is relying on Josile v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 39, Dezameau v. (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 559 and Desire v. (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 167, to argue that the RPD erred in not sufficiently considering the risk of violence and sexual assault faced by women in Haiti. The appellant further argues that the feared harm of being repeatedly robbed at gunpoint, forcing her to live at home in terror, is sufficient to constitute a serious infringement of her fundamental rights.\n[17] I agree with the appellant that the RPD does not expressly refer to the risk of sexual violence in its decision. While this risk may be inferred from the RPD's reasons, which refer more generally to [translation] \"gender-based violence\" and the possibility of persecution \"because she is a woman,\"2 I am of the opinion that the RPD does not provide a clear and sufficiently rigorous analysis of the documentary evidence regarding the current situation of women in Haiti and the impact it could have on the appellant's situation.\n[18] I also agree with the appellant's arguments set out in her additional submissions that the security situation in Haiti has deteriorated recently and that the risk for women of gender-based persecution has increased significantly.\n[19] On the basis of my own analysis of the evidence, I conclude that should the appellant return to Haiti, there is a serious possibility that she will be persecuted because she is a woman, as explained below.\nThe documentary evidence\n[20] Violence against women is a long-standing and \"widespread\" problem in Haiti, occurring in the context of a culture of discrimination. Gender-based violence can take many forms, including domestic violence, but these crimes often go unreported in Haiti.3 Sexual violence is used as a weapon of war, among other things, by armed gangs, which are rampant in the slums of Port-au-Prince and in disadvantaged metropolitan areas.4\n[21] The evidence indicates that it is very difficult to access reliable statistics on gender-based violence (GBV), which is severely underreported.\nFactors that increase the risk of violence against women\n[22] Although it is difficult to obtain reliable statistics on GBV, an analysis of all the documentary evidence reveals that the risk of non-domestic violence increases considerably for women and girls living in precarious conditions, without adequate housing and in areas of dire poverty, such as camps for displaced persons or the outskirts or slums of Port-au-Prince, which are controlled by armed gangs and where crime is rampant.5\nThe political and security crisis in Haiti and the impact on the situation of women\n[23] I also note that the political crisis that has gripped the country since 2018, and which culminated in the assassination of the President of the Republic in July 2021, has caused a significant rise in armed gang violence across the country, particularly in the capital, thereby exacerbating the risks faced by women.\n[24] It is important to point out that there is evidence that this violence has spread outside of the poor areas historically controlled by gangs, such as Cit\u00e9 Soleil and Bel-Air, where violence against women was most pervasive.6\n[25] According to a report by RNDHH:\nThe Haitian people have witnessed the gangs erization of the country. Today, all geographic departments have at least one (1) gang operating there. These various armed gangs engage in fierce hegemonic struggles, for control of the territories, for political and electoral purposes. They also fought among themselves to control markets, private enterprises, decentralized state bodies and public transport stations for economic purposes.7\n[26] \"New armed gang homes have emerged in neighborhoods that were previously considered relatively quiet.\"8 For example, the presence of criminal groups and kidnappings have been reported in P\u00e9tion-Ville and Delmas, outside of Port-au-Prince and along highways.9 It is reported that the armed gangs have been expanding their territory every day since the arrival of Dr. Ariel Henry as Prime Minister.10\n[27] UNICEF notes: \"the capital city is now facing an urban guerrilla, with thousands of children and women caught in the crossfire.\"11 According to the UN Integrated Office in Haiti: \"all segments of the population had been targeted\" [emphasis added] in human rights abuses caused by gang violence in Port-au-Prince.12\n[28] The high level of insecurity and violence makes the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince particularly vulnerable, and regularly causes the displacement of hundreds of families in susceptible neighbourhoods.13 Due to security risks (presence of gangs), some regions of the country, particularly in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, are still considered difficult to access for many actors. One source in Port-au-Prince reports: \"Commuting is too dangerous.\" The authorities have lost control of several areas, and \"gangsters are pillaging the population, raping women and shooting at passengers on buses or in cars.\"14\n[29] According to a report released by Assessment Capacities Project in February 2022, sexual violence often takes place in conjunction with other crimes:\nConcerns about sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) have increased amid political instability, a general increase in violence, and the expansion of territorial control by criminal gangs. ... reporting indicates SGBV including rape has been used in recent months to intimidate and control local populations, mainly affecting children, adolescents, and women. Survivors have been reporting SGBV in conjunction with other forms of violence such as kidnapping. SGBV is often invisible and underreported, due to shame, stigmatization, fear of reprisals, and mobility restrictions for survivors.15 [emphasis added]\n[30] In a report on the human rights situation in Haiti in 2020, a Haitian NGO reports that women from all social groups are being targeted by armed gangs:\n...women were [translation] \"greatly\" impacted by the \"unsafe\" situation in Haiti and that \"many\" women were kidnapped, raped, and murdered (D\u00e9fenseurs plus 21 Jan. 2021, 24). The same source states that women from all social groups were affected (D\u00e9fenseurs plus 21 Jan. 2021, 24). Sources indicated that women [and girls (Haiti 16 June 2021)] are being targeted by criminal groups and gangs in Haiti.16 [emphasis added]\n[31] Kidnappings increased by 200 percent in 2021, compared with the previous year,17 and this phenomenon affected all sections of society.18 Reuters reports that all social groups are targeted, as well as the poor and members of the middle class, who do not have security guards.19\n[32] Freedom House 2021 indicates that these crimes disproportionately affect women and girls.20 According to a United Nations report, kidnapped women \"are highly likely\" to be subjected to sexual and gender-based violence during their captivity.21 \"Women who are kidnapped are routinely raped, UN and health sector sources said.\"22\n[33] Despite the lack of comprehensive data in this regard, information collected by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti indicates that on average, 98 people per month were victims of sexual violence between January and March, 2022, in the Port-au-Prince area.23 These crimes are more frequent in cities or close to the airport or ports, or in working-class neighbourhoods controlled by gangs,24 but are not limited to these areas.\n[34] It is also reported that women are disproportionately victims of crime in general. According to a July 2022 UN report, [translation] \"women are often doubly or triply victimized by robbery, kidnapping, sexual abuse and exploitation. With rising socio-political tensions, women, particularly those in urban areas, live with fear and anxiety, and these feelings can lead to a deterioration in their mental and physical health.\"25\n[35] According to a UNICEF article published in April 2021, \"from September 2020 to February 2021 the number of women and children who were victims of armed assaults, including murders, injuries, rapes, and kidnappings, 'reportedly attributed to criminal gangs' increased by 62 percent compared to the previous report\".26\n[36] It is also reported that \"There was a continuation of home invasions in the more affluent areas of upper Port-au-Prince in 2015, 2016, and 2017\" and \"in middleclass neighborhoods (Delmas 75, Delmas 83, Laboul and Pelerin) outside the traditional expatriate residential areas\".27\nConclusion on the objective evidence\n[37] Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the risk of violence from armed gangs has increased significantly in Haiti, particularly in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, with an escalation following the assassination of the President of the Republic in July 2021. The evidence shows that women and girls are specifically targeted by armed gangs because of their gender. As mentioned above, they are doubly or triply victimized by robbery and kidnapping, crimes that are often accompanied by sexual violence.\n[38] This evidence establishes that the rampant crime in Haiti has a gender dimension, targeting women because of their gender. While the risk of violence is greatest for women living in areas of extreme poverty (such as camps for displaced persons or Port-au-Prince slums controlled by armed gangs), the more recent expansion of gangs across the capital demonstrates that women and girls from all social strata are at risk.\n[39] I find that the RPD erred in failing to conduct an in-depth analysis of the documentary evidence and to consider the gendered dimension of criminality rampant in Haiti that has been exposed by the recent political crisis.\nThe appellant's risk due to her profile\n[40] To determine whether a woman will face a serious risk of persecution if she returns to Haiti, the Federal Court found that it was necessary to assess her particular situation in light of the most current information on conditions in the country.28 In particular, the Court highlighted certain relevant factors that were important to consider: the geographical location, the refugee protection claimant's personal situation (whether she will be accompanied by a spouse or living with family) and male protection.29 I am of the opinion that these factors are not exhaustive, and may vary depending on the evidence regarding conditions in the country.\n[41] In the case before me, although the appellant enjoys a certain level of comfort and security, having a husband and her home in P\u00e9tion-Ville, one of the most privileged neighbourhoods in Port-au-Prince, the evidence establishes that the level of criminality has increased in Haiti over the last few years and crimes against women are much more widespread than in the past.\n[42] The more recent expansion of gangs throughout the capital, including in P\u00e9tion-Ville where the appellant has her home, the danger posed by moving about in a city besieged by criminal groups, and the generalized insecurity raise the appellant's risk of being subjected to gender-based violence to more than a mere possibility. While the appellant may have the benefit of her husband's protection, this in itself does not represent effective protection against the dangers to which she would be subjected as a woman.\n[43] It is also worth mentioning that as noted above, the statistics on violence against women are unreliable given that many of these crimes go unreported due to the stigma attached to them. For that reason, the panel must be vigilant about concluding that a claimant's profile does not reflect all the characteristics of a woman who would be most at risk, particularly in a context where violence against women is considered endemic and where the security situation continues to deteriorate.\n[44] I agree with the appellant that her profile need not fit the profile of women who are [translation] \"most likely\" to be victims of gender-based persecution; reasonable risk is sufficient.\n[45] Therefore, in light of the conditions that have prevailed in Haiti for some time, I am of the opinion that the appellant has demonstrated that she would face a reasonable possibility of persecution if she returned to her country because of her membership in the particular social group of women in Haiti.\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[46] According to the evidence, [translation] \"the actions of the police and the judicial system in response to sexual violence committed by organized gangs have been extremely weak.\" The National Police lack the resources and institutional capacity to address violence against women. Victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence face major obstacles in seeking justice, as well as in accessing protective services such as women's shelters. No legislation has been passed to expressly criminalize violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual violence, incest, marital rape, and sexual harassment. Sexual violence is reportedly trivialized in the justice system, and prosecutions rarely result in convictions. The perpetrators act with impunity, even when the victims are women in positions of \"power.\"30\n[47] I find that the appellant will not have adequate state protection if she returns to Haiti.\n[48] I also conclude that the appellant does not have an internal flight alternative in Haiti. The documentary evidence indicates that violence against women is systemic and widespread, and that the lack of adequate state protection extends throughout the country.31 Furthermore, as she is a 56-year-old woman with only one year of education, it would be objectively too difficult for her to resettle on her own elsewhere in Haiti, to find a place to live and to support herself in a country grappling with an acute political, security and economic crisis.32\nCONCLUSION\n[49] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the IRPA, I set aside the determination of the RPD, and declare the appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to be a refugee under section 96 of the IRPA.\n[50] The appeal is allowed.\n(signed)\nBianca Suciu\nBianca Suciu\nNovember 28, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Appellants are Sikh and from the state of Punjab. They married in 2016 against the wishes of the PA's mother who wanted the PA to marry the daughter of a XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, the day after the Appellants engagement, the PA was detained by the police and accused of Sikh separatism. He was released upon payment of a bribe. After the Appellants marriage in XXXX 2016, the AA was continually mistreated by the PA's mother. The PA applied for a visa to XXXX in XXXX 2018, which was refused. The Appellants then applied for visas to Canada in XXXX 2018, which were granted. In XXXX 2018, the PA was again temporarily detained by Punjab police on accusations of separatism. He was again released upon payment of a bribe. The Appellants relocated to Jalandhar and then travelled to Canada in XXXX 2018. They claimed refugee protection in January 2019.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the claims on the basis of an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Delhi or Mumbai. The Appellants appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). They do not present new evidence.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The determinative issue is IFA\nANALYSIS\n[4] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1\n[5] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged. First, I must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of an appellant being persecuted in the part of the country where an IFA exists or that the appellant would not be personally subjected to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA. Secondly, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to an appellant to seek refuge there. Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the appellant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFA(s) have been identified, the burden of proof rests on the appellant to show that they do not have an IFA.\n[6] Based on my assessment, I do not find the Appellants have established that they do not have an IFA, as follows.\nFirst prong: Appellants would be safe in the IFAs\n[7] The RPD concluded that it was not established that the Punjab police and XXXX XXXX XXXX have the means or motivation to pursue the Appellants to an IFA. The RPD noted that the Appellants and their families are not members of a political organization or activists for a separate Sikh state and, rather, that the allegations of imputed political opinion are based on a personal vendetta from the father of a woman the PA did not marry. Furthermore, the police's methods of trying to locate the Appellants have been to approach their families and they were unable to locate the Appellants while they were in Jalandhar. The Appellants were able to renew their passports and leave India through the Delhi airport without incident, and the PA does not have a profile of being someone of interest to police outside XXXX as he has never committed a serious crime and does not have any outstanding charges or a warrant. Finally, the PA was never charged with any offence thus there is insufficient evidence to establish that he is in a police database and, in any event, there is minimal interstate police communication except in cases of major crimes, the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) is not fully operational and the implementation of tenant verification systems is lacking.\n[8] The Appellants submit that the RPD accepted their allegations as credible and therefore an IFA is not possible for a person who is alleged or perceived to be a militant.2 Specifically, that a FIR or Court Order is not necessary against suspected militants pursuant to the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), and suspected Sikh militant sympathizers are subject to monitoring, detention and torture.3 The Appellants also submit that the RPD ignored that the PA was arrested twice on allegations of separatism4 and ignored tenant registration rules.5 The Appellants refer to information in various articles they produced to the Board.\n[9] Based on my assessment, I do not find that the RPD erred by concluding that the Appellants would be safe in an IFA, as follows.\nPunjab police and XXXX do not have the motivation to seek the Appellants to an IFA\n[10] At the outset, I note that police forces in India are organized by state and the police agent of persecution in the Appellants case is the Punjab police. I acknowledge information in the National Documentation Package (NDP) that the police may make efforts to trace individuals in cases of terrorism6 and, \"individuals who support or advocate for Khalistan are monitored\" and \"often included on police lists for heightened scrutiny.\"7 However, the Appellants submit that the police interest in the PA arises out of a vendetta from the XXXX XXXX XXXX due to the PA's refusal to marry his daughter. In fact, there is no evidence that the Punjab police have lodged any formal case against the PA and it was the PA's own evidence that there was no arrest, charge or documents, and he was simply released upon payment of a bribe.8 Furthermore, while the police had the PA in their custody, they simply let him go upon payment of a bribe. Notably, the Appellants do not indicate that they are actually involved with any separatist elements. Overall, the foregoing suggests that the police accusations of imputed separatist links are not grounded in any real concern that the Appellants are actually involved with separatists. Therefore, despite the police accusations of militancy, I find that there is a lack of evidence that the police may be actually concerned or believe that the Appellants are engaged in militancy or that they pose any threat, which undermines that there would be an organized or concerted inter-state police effort to seek the Appellants to an IFA.\n[11] Furthermore, since the time the Appellants travelled to Canada in 2018, the only evidence of the police's efforts to pursue them are visits to the Appellants' respective family homes approximately once a year in 2019, 2020 and 2021. A few visits over the span of several years to an obvious location (the Appellants former primary residences) does not suggest that the police have made serious efforts to locate the Appellants, which further undermines that they would be motivated to seek them to an IFA. Notably, as the RPD noted, the police did not locate the Appellants during the time they were in Jalandhar notwithstanding that it is also in the state of Punjab.\n[12] Overall, I find there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Punjab police and XXXX XXXX XXXX would have the motivation to try to locate the Appellants to an IFA.\nPunjab police and XXXX do not have the means to seek the Appellants to an IFA\n[13] I also do not find that the Appellants have established that the Punjab police or XXXX XXXX have the means to locate the Appellants to an IFA.\n[14] First, according to information in a Response to Information Request (RIR) in the NDP there is generally little inter-state police communication in India9 and,\n\"India does not have a centralised registration system in place to enable the police to check the whereabouts of inhabitants in their own state, let alone in any of the other states or union territories\" (UTs) (Australia 10 Dec. 2020, para. 5.39). Hanif Qureshi, the Inspector-General of Police in the state of Haryana, indicates that India does \"not have any national data[b]ase of criminals or gangs against which suspects can be identified\" (Qureshi 9 Jan. 2020). The same source further indicates that police systems between districts and states are not integrated, creating \"[i]slands of technology\" which can only communicate within a state or district (Qureshi 9 Jan. 2020). Qureshi notes, for example, that a police officer issuing a traffic ticket would not be aware of the individuals' traffic violation history in other states, and \"mostly [not] even within the state\" (Qureshi 9 Jan. 2020).10\n[15] The NDP also indicates that police stations across India are, \"virtually unconnected islands in the case of Crime & Criminal Tracking. There is no system of effective data storage ... sharing and accessing data,\" and there is \"no single system\" by which a police unit can \"talk to another directly\" [references omitted].11\n[16] Second, there is a lack of evidence to establish that the PA has been entered into any police or crime database in the first place, such as the CCTNS such that he could be traced to an IFA through any coordination between the Punjab police and police in the IFA. For example, as stated above, there is a lack of evidence to suggest the Punjab police lodged any formal case against the PA and it was his own evidence that there was no arrest, charge or documents, and he was simply released upon payment of a bribe.12 In addition, a source consulted in a RIR expressly indicates with respect to extrajudicial arrests \" '[n]o official record of such arrests is maintained' in official criminal databases, including CCTNS. [references omitted]13 Regarding information from a general diary or daily diary that may be captured in the CCTNS, there is insufficient evidence to establish that this might include information on the PA. Finally, the NDP indicates that information on \"persons of interest\"14 is not even recorded in the CCTNS in the first place but, rather, in classified databases that are not shared across states.15 Although I do not find that it has been established that the Appellants are in such a classified database, I acknowledge that the NDP goes on to say that concerned officers can seek such information \"through normal official channels,\"16 However, in the unlikely event that the Appellants are in a classified database, I nevertheless find there is insufficient evidence to establish that police in an IFA would have any cause to look beyond the CCTNS for the purposes of conducting standard checks such as for employment or tenancy, such that they might seek information directly from the UP police's classified database.\n[17] I also acknowledge evidence in the NDP that there may be inter-state police communication in cases of terrorism, however I do not find that this applies to the Appellants as I have found that it has not been established that the police may be genuinely concerned that the PA is involved in terrorism or is a threat. I also acknowledge that according to another RIR if the police \"put their minds to it,\"17 they could track and locate persons of interest, depending on the heinousness of the crime and the pressure received from political authorities, such as in in cases of rape, murder or armed robbery.18 However, the Appellants claim does not involve such allegations.\n[18] Third, as noted previously, the evidence indicates that the Punjab police's means to locate the Appellants has been by visiting their parents' homes on a sporadic basis. However, it appears the Punjab police are not even aware that the Appellants are out of the country, and the PA specifically testified that the police told the AA's father they were unable to locate the Appellants.19\n[19] Finally, in terms of any paper-based tenant verification procedure, even if it is mandatory for landlords to register their tenants, ultimately it is up to the local police stations to do the actual verification. However, the NDP evidence suggests that police compliance is lacking. For example, one RIR20 refers to an article from India Today indicating that where Delhi Police attempted to verify tenants but \"in almost all cases, the police of other states fail to even give any revert on the case.\" An article from Mail Today indicated that in a visit to about 25 police stations in Delhi, in most police stations the verification forms were found dumped, gathering dust with no action being taken to complete the procedure. Specifically, with respect to Mumbai, a Mumbai Police Commissioner stated that \"it is impossible for the police to actually verify the identity of all those who rent property\" in Navi Mumbai, that \"the police force is not equipped to personally go and check all new tenants,\" [references omitted] and the police does not \"'have enough men to do thorough checks on each verification form that comes to [them]. [They] can ensure checks against fake documents by asking for multiple documents proof, but that's about it.' \" [references omitted]21 The same NDP evidence also cites a lawyer as stating that the entire process of tenant verification \"has several loopholes\", the cops are often unfamiliar with the rules of the tenancy act, \"they don't even do spot checks, taking the written document as the final word, which generally leads to discrepancies\" and the \"police force is just ill-equipped and short-staffed to actually carry out such verifications when they get over 50 forms daily.\"22 According to an Associate Professor, \"[i]nformation about tenants is very limited and Delhi\/Mumbai and a few other metropolises have intermittently tried to develop a database and verify the information. To the best of [his] knowledge, this is very inadequate and not updated regularly.\"23 I acknowledge that, according to a RIR, tenant registration can be performed through a Digital Police portal that would provide access to authorized persons to use National Database of crime records. 24 However, I have already found that the Appellants have not established that they might have been entered in any crime database in the first place.\n[20] Overall, I find that there is insufficient evidence of the Punjab police and XXXX XXXX having the means to locate the Appellants to an IFA.\nAppellants would not be at risk based on religion or actual or imputed political opinion\n[21] The RPD considered the treatment of Sikh persons and advocates of an independent Khalistan and concluded that the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFAs on the basis of religion or actual or imputed political opinion.25 I have considered the RPD's reasons in this regard and agree with them. I further note that according to an RIR,26 while there are instances of communal violence, \"cases of localized conflict or harassment by Hindu nationalists... does not represent a systemic pattern.\" [references omitted][emphasis added] In addition, while there have been \"reports of minor cases of violence against Sikhs,\"27 [references omitted][emphasis added] and item 12.10 of the NDP indicates that targeting of Sikhs is to a \"lesser degree\" or \"less frequently\" than other religious minorities.28 In addition, as noted by the RPD, the Appellants are not politically active or advocates for an independent Khalistan, and there is insufficient evidence to establish they would be at risk of persecution for being imputed as such in the IFAs.\n[22] Therefore, while I accept that there is communal violence in India which affects Sikhs, I find there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellants would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of religion or real or imputed political opinion in the IFAs.\nAppellants would be safe from the PAs mother and sister in an IFA\n[23] I note that the Appellants suggest in this appeal that the AA faces a risk from her mother-in-law and sister-in-law.29 I am not persuaded.\n[24] First, the Appellants made no claim before the RPD that the AA was at risk of persecution from her sister-in-law, and led no evidence in this regard. Therefore, I find the Appellants have failed to establish that the AA has a well-founded fear of persecution from her sister-in-law.\n[25] Regarding the mother-in-law, the Appellants testified that they have not been contacted by her and they have no information as to her whereabouts.30 I acknowledge that the AA testified that the mother-in-law is \"hand in gloves with the police.\"31 However, I note that the AA also testified that the mother-in-law was aware of the Appellants relocation to Jalandhar,32 yet the Appellants were not located by the police. I find this undermines that the mother-in-law is connected with the police or that the AA would be at risk of persecution in the IFA from her based on any connections she may have with the police. Finally, while it is the Appellants obligation to establish their claims, they have led no evidence of what means or motivation the mother-in-law has that could enable her to harm or persecute the AA in an IFA.\n[26] Overall, I find that the Appellants have failed to establish that the AA would be at risk from her mother-in-law or sister-in-law in the IFAs.\nSecond prong: Relocation is not unreasonable\n[27] The RPD concluded that the conditions in the IFA were not such that it would be unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate there. In respect of analyzing the reasonableness of a proposed IFA under the second prong, the Federal Court of Appeal has held that there is:\n...[A] very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.33\n[28] The Court has reiterated the importance of not lowering that threshold.\n[29] In Thirunavukkarasu, the Court said:\n...[N]either is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there. If it is objectively reasonable in these latter cases to live in these places, without fear of persecution, then IFA exists and the claimant is not a refugee.34\n[30] The RPD noted that the Appellants are young, healthy and well-educated, and have been able to secure employment and navigate living in Canada since XXXX 2018. Also, the PA speaks Punjabi and English and both Appellants studied English and Hindi in school. The RPD also considered the Appellants Sikh faith and concluded that while they may encounter language barriers in the IFA, the conditions overall are not such that the relocation to the IFA would be unreasonable. The Appellants do not dispute these findings.\n[31] Having considered the evidence independently, I agree with the RPD's reasons. Furthermore, while I acknowledge that the Appellants testified that the relocation would not be reasonable due to the risk of Hindu-Sikh violence, as discussed above, the risk in this regard is low and would not render relocation to the IFA unreasonable.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] Overall, based on the foregoing analysis, I find that the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution under s. 96 or, on a balance of probabilities, one of the harms set out under s. 97 of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act in the IFAs, and that the conditions in the IFAs are not such that it would be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellants, for them to seek refuge there.\n[33] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\nMarch 8, 2022\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Motifs et d\u00e9cision\nPerson who is the subject of the appeal\nXXXX XXXX XXXX\nPersonne en cause\nDate of decision\nMarch 10, 2022\nDate de la d\u00e9cision\nPanel\nSasha Cragg-Gore\nTribunal\nCounsel for the person who is the subject of the appeal\nAdam Wawrzkiewicz\nConseil de la personne en cause\nDesignated representative\nN\/A\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] These are my reasons for allowing the appeal of XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Principal Appellant). He is a citizen of Tanzania and alleges that he cannot return there because he identifies as gay. Same-sex sexual relations between men is illegal in Tanzania.1 He alleges that he had a four-year relationship with a man named XXXX and that he was arrested after kissing him at a party. He was released on bail with his brother's help and fled the country. He travelled to Canada and claimed refugee status.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected his claim for the following main reasons:\na. He was unable to provide details about XXXX work despite alleging that they first got to know each other by discussing business;\nb. The Appellant knew very little about XXXX family, what has happened to him since the Appellant left the country, and could not provide any details of the types of activities they did together;\nc. The Appellant alleged he was arrested at a party for kissing XXXX but could not consistently describe who he knew at the party and whether their relationship was a secret to the party guests;\nd. The police summons had a spelling error and the other evidence did not overcome the credibility concerns.\n[3] The Appellant contests this decision. He has not requested to submit new evidence or hold an oral hearing on appeal. He makes the following main arguments:\na. The Appellant's testimony was not vague, inconsistent or lacking in detail when he described attending a gay club in 2000 before he identified as gay;\nb. The Appellant provided sufficient detail about XXXX business and the activities they did together given the Appellant's personal circumstances;\nc. It is reasonable that the Appellant might not know what has happened to XXXX since the Appellant left the country;\nd. The Appellant's minor inconsistency as to whom he knew at the party should not be held against him;\ne. The RPD erred by failing to effectively engage with evidence submitted to the RPD, including a certificate of bail.\n[4] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find that the Appellant has established his identity as a gay man and his relationship with XXXX.\n[6] In rendering this decision, I have considered and applied Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics (the SOGIESC Guideline).\nDECISION\n[7] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nThe RPD failed to correctly consider and apply the SOGIESC Guideline\n[8] I find that the RPD failed to consider and apply the SOGIESC Guideline in important ways and will discuss these errors in detail before turning to the rest of the evidence. They relate to the Appellant's testimony about attending a club frequented by gay people before he was out of the closet and his hesitance to disclose his relationship with XXXX in an LGBTQ-friendly space.\nThe RPD failed to consider and apply the SOGIESC Guideline by adopting an overly narrow, simplistic, and rigid view of the Appellant's journey in accepting his sexual orientation\n[9] By implying that only openly gay individuals would attend a club frequented by gay people, the RPD relied on incorrect assumptions about the Appellant's journey in accepting his sexual orientation. In doing so, the RPD erred by not properly considering and applying the SOGIESC Guideline.\n[10] The Appellant testified that he used to attend a club frequented by gay people in 2000, but that no one knew about his sexual orientation at the time. The RPD concluded that these two statements were contradictory. The Appellant argues that there is no real contradiction between going to a club frequented by gay people and still being in the closet.\n[11] I agree with the Appellant that there is nothing contradictory about attending a club frequented by gay people while still being in the closet. The RPD relied on an incorrect assumption that the Appellant would not attend a gay club or meet with anyone who identified as gay unless he himself identified as gay.\n[12] It is entirely possible and plausible that the Appellant frequented LGBTQ-friendly spaces before he himself identified as gay, as part of his own unique journey in accepting his sexual orientation. Rather than a contradiction, I find the Appellant's testimony on this point to be indicative of a credible and nuanced description of his own journey in accepting his sexual orientation.\n[13] The SOGIESC Guideline cautions members about incorrectly relying on a universal or standard \"coming out\" narrative.3 I find that the RPD took an overly narrow, simplistic, and rigid view of the Appellant's journey in accepting his sexual orientation. The RPD did this by incorrectly assuming that he would not attend a club frequented by gay people unless he himself already identified as gay.\n[14] As pointed out by the SOGIESC Guideline, the journey to accepting one's sexual orientation may be \"gradual or non-linear\",4 particularly in an environment where same-sex activity is stigmatized, illegal, against one's religion, and is considered shameful. The Appellant testified about his own gradual and non-linear acceptance process which included attending a club frequented by gay individuals before he himself identified this way. Rather than revealing a credibility concern, I find that his hesitation during his process of self-identification supports his alleged sexual orientation.\nThe RPD failed to consider and apply the SOGIESC Guideline by incorrectly assuming the Appellant would be comfortable disclosing his relationship with XXXX to strangers, regardless of their sexual orientation\n[15] I find that the RPD also failed to consider and apply the SOGIESC Guideline when analysing the Appellant's hesitance in disclosing his relationship with XXXX in an LGBTQ-friendly space.\n[16] The RPD found it contradictory that the Appellant was hesitant to reveal his relationship with XXXX at a party at XXXX house even though he knew that all the guests at the party were from the LGBTQ community. Once again, I find that the RPD relied on incorrect assumptions of how the Appellant should act in the circumstances.\n[17] The Appellant testified that he had never met XXXX friends before but was aware that they were from the LGBTQ community. Given the shame and stigma associated with being gay or having a same-sex relationship in Tanzania, it is problematic that the RPD would assume that the Appellant would automatically feel comfortable revealing his relationship with XXXX to strangers, even if they are from the same community. Disclosing something shrouded in stigma and shame is a complex and nuanced decision and revealing this type of information in a social setting may naturally take place slowly and gradually or not at all.\n[18] By assuming how comfortable the Appellant should be disclosing his relationship with XXXX in an LGBTQ-friendly space, the RPD contravened the SOGIESC Guideline. It is an error to assume that a gay man would necessarily feel comfortable disclosing his sexual orientation to others in his lives, even more so to strangers.5 I find that the RPD erred in making this finding.\nTestimony about how often the Appellant attended a club frequented by gay people was not vague or evasive\n[19] The RPD also found that the Appellant's testimony about attending a club frequented by gay people in 2000 was not credible because he was vague about how often he went. I agree with the Appellant that the RPD made an error in making this finding.\n[20] When asked about how often he went to this club, the Appellant responded that he did not go continuously because he was a student. This question was asked after a series of other questions that he answered with ease, including questions about the name of the club, who he went with and where it was located.\n[21] I do not find the Appellant's testimony about how often he went to the club to be vague. While he did not give a precise frequency or time range, his answer was responsive to the question asked. The Appellant was discussing attending a club infrequently more than 20 years ago, and I do not find his testimony to be vague or evasive. I find that the RPD erred in finding his testimony on this point vague and evasive.\nThe Appellant provided sufficient detail about his relationship with XXXX in the circumstances\n[22] The Appellant testified that he first started meeting XXXX to discuss his business and that this eventually developed into a four-year romantic relationship. The RPD found that the Appellant was unable to provide details about their business discussions and the activities they did together and concluded that his relationship with XXXX was not established. The Appellant argues that the RPD had unreasonable expectations as to what details the Appellant was expected to provide, and the Appellant maintains that he provided sufficient detail to establish his relationship with XXXX. I agree with the Appellant.\n[23] The Appellant alleges that he met XXXX on a plane travelling to Dubai and that for a few months, they would call each other and meet for coffee to discuss business. He testified that XXXX agreed to help him financially in his XXXX business by expanding it into the market in Dubai and alleges in his Basis of Claim (BOC) that they discussed the possibility of a start-up funding for a business re-selling XXXX XXXX from Dubai in Tanzania. He also testified that they discussed going into business together.\n[24] The Appellant did not finish high school, worked as a XXXX XXXX and went to Dubai originally to buy XXXX on behalf of someone else. He met with XXXX for short periods of time initially and had a few phone calls with him to discuss his business plans.\n[25] Given these circumstances, I agree with the Appellant that he provided enough detail about his business discussions with XXXX. I also agree with the Appellant that if he was scoping out the possibility of connecting with XXXX in a romantic way, he may not have been paying much attention to their business discussions as is argued on appeal. I also note that he did provide some details about his business discussions as outlined above. In these circumstances, I find that the RPD erred in concluding that the Appellant provided insufficient detail about his business discussions with XXXX.\n[26] The RPD also impugned the Appellant's credibility because he was unable to provide any details about XXXX family or what he and XXXX did together beyond meeting in a hotel room for intimate encounters. I agree with the Appellant that for two men having a secret affair with few opportunities to see each other and be open about their relationship, the Appellant provided enough detail about XXXX and the activities they did together.\n[27] While the Appellant could have provided more detail about what they did when they went out together in Dubai, something he does state in his BOC,6 I do not find this to be a sufficient reason to discount his overall relationship with XXXX. I note that the Appellant provided coherent and detailed evidence about how they met, the first time they became intimate, and the party that led them to be caught by the police. There is also a significant amount of corroborative evidence that I will discuss below. Overall, I find that the Appellant has established his relationship with XXXX on a balance of probabilities.\nThe Appellant has established his identity as a gay man despite a minor credibility concern\n[28] The Appellant has provided a letter from XXXX, his brother, his friend, his neighbor as well as a summons and bail certificate from the police.7 Taken together, this evidence assists the Appellant in establishing his sexual orientation, his relationship with XXXX and the circumstances of his arrest and subsequent release from police custody. I acknowledge that there is a minor spelling error in the police summons,8 however, there are no errors in the bail certificate from the same police station which explicitly states that the Appellant had been arrested due to his involvement in a same-sex relationship.9\n[29] When I consider all the credible and detailed evidence establishing the Appellant's sexual orientation as gay, I find that the minor error in the police summons is insufficient for me to discount the Appellant's allegations or find him uncredible. I also give the bail certificate significant weight as it corroborates not only his release from custody, but also the fact that he was arrested due to his involvement in a same-sex relationship. I note that there were no major inconsistencies in the Appellant's testimony about his arrest, his relationship with XXXX and his release from police custody.\nThe Appellant would face a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to Tanzania\n[30] I find that the Appellant has established his sexual orientation as gay, on a balance of probabilities. He has established his long-term relationship with a man, as well as his arrest because of same-sex activity in Tanzania. Same-sex conduct is punishable with up to life in prison in Tanzania.10 The Appellant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to Tanzania due to his identity as a gay man.\nOther RPD findings are not determinative\n[31] The RPD also made a credibility finding relating to an apparent contradiction in regards to how many people the Appellant knew at XXXX party. The Appellant first testified that he did not know all of the guests at the party, and then testified that he only knew XXXX. I agree with the Appellant that while the Appellant could have been more precise, any potential contradiction between these two statements is minor and does not represent a credibility concern.\n[32] The RPD also found that the Appellant was not credible because he did not know about XXXX situation since the Appellant left the country. That being said, the Appellant had come out to his brother who remained in Tanzania, and the Appellant's careless behaviour at the party that led to their arrest. When I consider the cultural context as well as these particular circumstances, I agree with the Appellant that it is entirely possible that XXXX would have felt uncomfortable sharing his updates with the Appellant. I agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred in making a negative credibility inference because of this.\nThere is no viable internal flight alternative (IFA) nor adequate state protection available to the Appellant\n[33] As same-sex conduct is illegal throughout Tanzania and the authorities are in control of the entire territory of Tanzania,11 there is no viable IFA available to the Appellant. For the same reason, the Appellant would also not receive adequate state protection if he were to return there.\nThe Minister was not given notice pursuant to the Alazar decision\n[34] The Minister did not intervene before the RPD or the RAD and is therefore not a party to this appeal. However, as my decision extends to the issues of IFA and state protection that can be interpreted as going beyond the issues addressed by the RPD, I considered whether I had to give notice to the Minister, pursuant to the decision in Alazar.12 I determined that, in this instance, notice is not required because IFA and state protection are moot issues in the context of a claim based on sexual orientation where being gay is illegal in the country of reference.\n[35] The Appellant has alleged that he was detained due to his sexual orientation and has submitted multiple police documents to corroborate this allegation. The RPD assessed the police summons in its decision and the Appellant argues in his memo that the RPD failed to correctly assess both the police summons and the bail certificate. The credibility of the Appellant's allegation of being detained due to his sexuality was therefore clearly at issue in this appeal. More broadly, the credibility of the Appellant's asserted sexual orientation is a central issue in this appeal.\n[36] I have accepted both that the Appellant is gay and that he was detained for this reason in the context of a country in which same-sex conduct is illegal and the police maintain control of the territory. My conclusion that there is no viable IFA nor adequate state protection flows naturally from these findings. In fact, I struggle to see how any other conclusion on IFA and state protection is possible in these circumstances.\n[37] For these reasons, notice was not provided to the Minister pursuant to Alazar.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nMarch 10, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Tanzania (23 April 2021), item 6.1, Response to Information Request (RIR) TZA106150.FE, Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), 17 September 2018.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

His allegations are as follows.\n[2] The Appellant operated a XXXX XXXX in India and employed two Muslim workers, CD and SF. He says in XXXX 2018, he was harassed by a gang of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who accused him of XXXX XXXX. The police refused to help the Appellant and instead accused him of being involved with anti-nationalists. On XXXX XXXX, 2018 the police raided CD's home in search of CD's son in connection with the arrest of another Muslim in Jalandhar. The police alleged to have recovered a pistol at CD's home and demanded that the Appellant act as a witness. The Appellant refused and confronted the police. The police officers detained and tortured him, and accused him of being involved with radicals. The Appellant was released upon payment of a bribe. The Appellant complained to the Deputy Commissioner of Police and, accordingly on XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Appellant was detained again. He was taken to the XXXXCriminal Investigation Detention (CID) Centre where he was interrogated by Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab Special Cell Police, and told to surrender his passport. After the Appellant was released, he fled India on an existing visa to Canada. On XXXX XXXX, 2018 he was summoned by the police.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the claim based on an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Mumbai and Delhi. The Appellant appeals to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).\nDECISION\n[4] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee. The determinative issue is IFA.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[5] The Appellant states that he has not presented new evidence.1 Nevertheless, he encloses the following documents that were not before the RPD:\na. Article - \"A Comprehensive Discussion of the Internal Flight Option for Punjabi Sikh Survivors of Political Rape and other Forms of Institutionalized Violence\" by Judith Malik dated October 30, 2004;2\nb. Article - \"No Safe Haven: The Myth of the Internal Flight Alternative in India for Returned Sikh Asylum Seekers\" by ENSAAF dated December 27, 2004;3\nc. Decision No. 319\/2007 of the United Nations Committee Against Torture;4\nd. Article - \"India's Hindu Nationalist Project Relies on Brutal Repression\" dated April 2021;5\ne. Article - \"India: Intimations of an Ending\" dated November 22, 2019;6 and\nf. Human Rights Watch - \"India: Vigilante 'Cow Protection' Groups Attack Minorities\" dated February 18, 2019.7\nThe new evidence presented by the Appellant is rejected\n[6] According to the Law,8 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the appellant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n(iv) If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.9\n[7] Items 'a,' 'b,' 'd,' and 'e' are articles. All of these documents predate the RPD's decision and therefore arose prior to the rejection of the claim. The onus is on the Appellant to establish the admissibility of new evidence with full and detailed submissions, however he has not provided any explanation for why these documents were not reasonably available prior to the rejection of the claim or why he could not reasonably have been expected to have provided this evidence beforehand. Notably, the Appellant was represented by counsel before the RPD and the claim was not rejected until nearly a month later. It is not up to the RAD to establish the admissibility of new evidence on behalf of the Appellant, and an appeal is not an opportunity to rectify a deficient record. Items 'a,' 'b,' 'd,' and 'e' are rejected as new evidence for not meeting the requirements of subsection 110(4).\n[8] Item 'c' is jurisprudence, which is not considered new evidence.\n[9] Item 'f' is already contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) and is therefore also not new evidence.\nNo oral hearing\n[10] As there is no accepted new evidence, the request for an oral hearing is denied.\nANALYSIS\n[11] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.10\n[12] At the outset I note that the RPD decision determined that the Appellant's claim did not engage a nexus to a Convention ground.11 Based on my independent assessment, I find that the police's allegations of anti-nationalism have a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion, and that the allegations of XXXX XXXX and the police accusations that the Appellant is involved with Muslims engages a nexus to religion. Therefore, the claim will be considered under section 96.\n[13] Also based on my assessment, I find the Appellant's allegations to be credible. A review of the transcript indicates that he testified in a spontaneous and forthright manner and there were no major inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions. I also accept that the Appellant reasonably explained his delay in claiming protection, which was that his agent had told him he would provide him with a work permit.12\nThe Appellant does not have an internal flight alternative\n[14] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Rasaratnam.13 First, I must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of an appellant being persecuted in the part of the country where an IFA exists and\/or the appellant would not be personally subjected to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA. Secondly, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellant, for the Appellant to seek refuge there. Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellant to show that they do not have an IFA.\n[15] Based on my assessment, I find the RPD erred by concluding that the Appellant would be safe in an IFA.\nThe Punjab police would be motivated to look for the Appellant in an IFA\n[16] While the RPD accepted that the Punjab police appear to remain interested in the Appellant locally in Punjab, it concluded that there was no persuasive evidence that the police looked for the Appellant outside of Punjab.14 The RPD concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the police would be interested in harming the Appellant in the IFA locations.\n[17] Based on my assessment, I find that the RPD erred by relying on the Punjab police's failure to look for the Appellant outside of Punjab. Specifically, I note that the Appellant testified that upon arrival to Canada, he had his parents send proof to the local police that he was in Canada, and therefore no longer in India.15 As a result, I do not find the police's failure to look for the Appellant outside of Punjab to be significant. Furthermore, I note the Appellant's evidence that the police continue to attend at his parents' home to see if he has returned.16 I find this indicates an ongoing interest in the Appellant.\n[18] I also find the police's accusations of anti-nationalism are based on their genuinely held beliefs, such that they would be motivated to seek the Appellant to an IFA. Specifically, there are two elements to the police's interest in the Appellant. First, the police are interested in the Appellant due to the influence of local XXXX XXXXgroups. I do not find that this would motivate the police to look for the Appellant in an IFA.\n[19] However, the police also appear to be interested in the Appellant due to his affiliation with CD. Specifically, the Appellant gave evidence that the police are searching for CD's son due to his connection with Muslims,17 and that when he refuted the allegations and refused to act as a witness, the police accused him of militant links as well.18 The foregoing suggests that the police are genuinely interested in the Appellant due to genuinely held concerns of links with militants. According to the NDP, police may make inter-state efforts to trace individuals in cases of terrorism.19 Furthermore, the Appellant gave evidence that he was interrogated at a Criminal Investigation Detention Centre by both the Punjab Special Cell and Jammu and Kashmir police. This indicates that the police interest in him is not just localized, but that there has been interstate cooperation in his case.20 Notably, the Appellant testified that police officers from various stations across Punjab have been attending his parents place in search of him, and not just his local police.21\n[20] Therefore, based on the foregoing, I accept that the authorities would be motivated to search for the Appellant to an IFA.\nPunjab police would have the means to look for Appellant in an IFA\n[21] The RPD concluded that the Appellant did not establish that the authorities have the means to locate him in an IFA, citing poor police communication across states. I find that the RPD erred as it failed to address the Crime and Criminal Network Tracking System (CCTNS) and whether or not the Appellant could have been entered into the system such that any routine background searches by police in an IFA would raise any alerts. Based on my assessment, I accept that the Appellant was likely entered into a national police database that is shared across states and is therefore at risk.\n[22] First, as noted, the Appellant's evidence is that he was interrogated by Punjab Special Cell forces and Jammu and Kashmir forces in an actual criminal detention centre. Secondly, it was the Appellant's evidence that the police gave his parents a summons.22 Although the Appellant did not produce the summons to the Board, he reasonably explained that he had asked his parents to return the summons to the police along with evidence that he was no longer in India. Based on my assessment, I find that the Appellant being interrogated in an actual detention centre with two state police forces and a summons being issued indicates that there is formal or official police interest in him such that he would have been entered into the CCTNS. As of October 31, 2020, there was \"connectivity\" at 15,620 police stations out of 16,098 police stations in India (97 percent) and CCTNS software had been \"deployed\" at 15,263 of 16,098 police stations in India (95 percent).23 Finally, as previously noted, according to the NDP, police may make inter-state efforts to trace individuals in cases of terrorism.24\n[23] As I find it is likely that at some point in the IFA the Appellant will be subject to a routine background check, such as for employment or tenancy purposes, that the Punjab police would be alerted to his location. Therefore, I find the Punjab police would have the means to locate him in an IFA.\nConclusion on the first prong: Appellant would not be safe in the IFA\n[24] Overall, despite evidence of shortcomings in the state police forces' ability to track a person's nationally, in the particular circumstances of this case, I find the Punjab police would have the means and motivation to locate the Appellant in an IFA and therefore that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA. As the first prong of the IFA analysis has been satisfied, I will not proceed to the second prong.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[25] As the agents of persecution are police forces that would have the means and motivation to persecute him to an IFA, I find the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. State protection is not a new issue which gives rise to the requirement for notice as it has been raised in the Appellant's appeal.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxx\nApril 27, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit P-2, Appellants record at p. 1.\n2 Ibid., at p. 15.\n3 Ibid., at p. 22.\n4 Ibid., at p. 2.\n5 Ibid., p. 41.\n6 Ibid., at p. 52.\n7 Ibid., at p. 74.\n8 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, subsection 110(4).\n9 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Motifs et d\u00e9cision\nPerson who is the subject of the appeal\nXXXX XXXX XXXX\nPersonne en cause\nDate of decision\nAugust 18, 2022\nDate de la d\u00e9cision\nPanel\nJ. Pollock\nTribunal\nCounsel for the person who is the subject of the appeal\nAlfonso Mejia-Arias\nConseil de la personne en cause\nDesignated representative\nN\/A\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] These are my reasons for allowing the appeal of XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant) and recognizing him as a Convention refugee.\n[2] The Appellant is a citizen of Mexico from Veracruz. He alleges that his ex-common-law spouse, A.M.C.S.,1 subjected him to intimate partner violence in Mexico. At his Refugee Protection Division (RPD) hearing, he testified that the abuse was verbal and physical.2 In 2017, the couple separated but continued living together with their children until XXXX 2019. The Appellant alleges that A.M.C.S.'s family members attacked him and warned him about their connection to Los Zetas. In XXXX 2019, he was threatened while attempting to see his children at school, and later that month he was assaulted at gunpoint. His persecutors warned him that they have connections with the authorities and told him not to seek protection.\n[3] The RPD found that the Appellant was generally a credible witness. However, the RPD denied the Appellant's claim, finding that he does not have a nexus and that he has a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Cabo San Lucas, M\u00e9rida, and Mexico City. The Appellant argues that the RPD's nexus and IFA findings are incorrect. He has not provided any new evidence on appeal, and I cannot hold a hearing.3\n[4] I am reviewing the RPD's decision on the standard of correctness as I do not find the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage.4 Having independently assessed the Record, I find that the RPD erred in part. The RPD was correct to find the Appellant credible. However, I find that the RPD's IFA determination is in error. In my independent assessment, I have applied the revised Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Gender Guideline).5 The Appellant's right to seek access to his children, who are in the care of his abusive ex-spouse in Mexico, places him at a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. I find that the Appellant does not have access to a viable IFA or adequate state protection in Mexico, and that he is a Convention refugee.\nDECISION\n[5] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nTHE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION'S (RAD) NOTIFICATION OF A NEW ISSUE\n[6] The Minister did not intervene in the Appellant's claim before the RPD or the RAD. Further to the Federal Court's decision in Alazar, I have considered whether \"the case has materially shifted away from the RPD's decision and the appeal as it was framed by the [person subject to the appeal]\" such that procedural fairness requires me to notify the Minister before rendering my decision.6 On August 2, 2022, I provided notice of the following new issues:\n* The RAD will consider whether the Appellant has access to adequate state protection in Mexico.\n* Given that the Appellant alleges that he experienced intimate partner violence in Mexico, the RAD will apply the updated Chairperson's Gender Guideline.7\n[7] The Minister has not responded with submissions or evidence by the 10-day deadline, or by the date of these Reasons. I have decided the appeal based on the materials provided.8\nANALYSIS\nThe RAD's application of the updated Gender Guideline in this appeal\n[8] On July 18, 2022, the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) released the updated Gender Guideline. The focus of the previous Gender Guideline was on women refugee claimants. However, the updated Gender Guideline \"broadens the focus to include all genders and gender identities, while recognizing that women and girls and SOGIESC (sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics) individuals are disproportionately impacted by gender-based violence, gender inequality and discrimination, all of which are human rights issues.\"9 Given that the Appellant alleges that he experienced intimate partner violence at the hands of his ex-spouse in Mexico, I have applied the updated Gender Guideline in my independent assessment. The RPD did not have the benefit of the updated Gender Guideline when it rendered its decision.\nThe RPD's credibility finding is correct\n[9] The RPD found that the Appellant is a generally credible witness.10 Having reviewed the entire Record, I have no reason to find otherwise on appeal. In my independent assessment, I find that the Appellant's testimony was materially consistent. The RPD properly questioned the Appellant about the abuse that he suffered in a respectful manner.11 I find that the Appellant has credibly established his allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe RPD's nexus finding is in error\n[10] The RPD determined that the Appellant failed to establish a nexus to a Convention ground. In the RPD's view, \"the breakdown of the claimant's relationship with his ex-partner and vengeance by her and her family has no nexus to the Convention refugee definition.\"12 I disagree. The Appellant alleges that he is a survivor of Gender Based Violence (GBV). As he explained in testimony, the Mexican police laughed at him and called him a pejorative feminine term, which means that he was 'overpowered by a woman.'13 Whether from the perspective of his abuser or state agents in Mexico, the Appellant is perceived by his persecutors14 as violating male gender norms. I find that he has established a nexus to a Convention ground based on his particular social group, based on his perceived non-conformity with socially accepted gender norms for men in Mexico.\nThe defence of human rights in considering membership in a particular social group\n[11] In determining whether the Appellant has established a nexus to the Convention ground based on his particular social group, I have taken guidance from the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC). In Ward, SCC Justice La Forest held that \"[t]he meaning assigned to 'particular social group' in the Act should take into account the general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination that form the basis for the international refugee protection initiative.\"15 Justice La Forest went on to identify three possible 'particular social group' categories, holding that the first category of groups defined by \"an innate or unchangeable characteristic\" would include \"individuals fearing persecution on such bases as gender.\"16 This remains the case even as it is now widely accepted that gender is not unchangeable; \"An individual's gender includes gender identity and expression, both of which can be fluid and flexible.\"17 Gender refers to \"the characteristics, attitudes and behaviours that are socially or culturally associated with a person's sex as perceived or assigned at birth.\"18\n[12] In his later dissent in Chan, Justice La Forest provided further clarification about the ground of 'particular social group.'19 The majority in Chan did not address the ground of particular social group. As a result, Justice La Forest's comments in the minority in Chan \"carry considerable persuasive authority, inasmuch as they were not contradicted by the majority, and represent the views of a significant number of Supreme Court Justices.\"20 Justice La Forest wrote:\n[83] As I believed apparent at the time of that decision, only a working rule was enunciated in Ward, not an unyielding deterministic approach to resolving whether a refugee claimant could be classified within a particular social group. The 'general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination' (p. 739) were to remain the paramount consideration in determining a claimant's membership in any particular social group [emphases added].21\n[13] In determining whether the Appellant was targeted by reason of his gender, I recognize that a particular social group cannot be defined solely based on its members \"common victimization as the objects of persecution.\"22 In my view, the Appellant's particular social group is grounded in his perceived non-conformity with gender norms for men in Mexico. I find that the themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination support a recognition that men survivors of GBV form a particular social group based on their gender. A person cannot be expected to conform to socially accepted gender norms to remain safe. To find otherwise would amount to a serious interference with that person's fundamental human rights.\nThe Appellant has established a nexus based on his particular social group\n[14] The Gender Guideline states: \"[t]he Convention refugee ground of 'membership in a particular social group' set out in section 96 of the IRPA and the Refugee Convention includes individuals fearing gender-based persecution.\"23 The Gender Guideline also sets out that men and boys can experience GBV.24 A similar view is expressed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in its Guidelines on International Protection No. 1: Gender-Related Persecution within the context of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention and\/or its 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees: \"[g]ender-related claims may be brought by either women or men, although due to particular types of persecution, they are more commonly brought by women.\"25\n[15] The Appellant's experience of GBV at the hands of his female partner is connected to a perception that he no longer conforms to socially accepted gender norms, including expectations connected to masculinity, or machismo. As explained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico:\nMasculinity, or machismo, is valued as being superior to femininity, or marianismo. Mexican society is therefore 'particularly hostile to any sign of the feminine in a man, and, to a lesser degree, of the masculine in a woman' [emphases added].26\nPersistent discriminatory stereotypes about the roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and in society, as well as intersecting forms of discrimination and the deep-rooted machismo culture in the State party, continue to impede progress in advancing gender equality. 27\n[16] In my view, it is both possible and necessary to acknowledge the negative impact that gender inequality can have on men, while also recognizing the disproportionate rate of GBV faced by women. Women, girls, and members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, and Queer (LGBTIQ) community continue to face structural barriers and discriminatory practices, pervasive GBV, and harmful gender norms, which restrict the exercise of their fundamental human rights. This unequal distribution of power is further compounded by intersecting oppressions, such as racism, homophobia, and ableism. Femicide-or the intentional murder of women because they are women-is one of the most pressing human rights issues in Mexico; \"There has been a social and cultural expectation in Latin America since the Spanish conquest, that men are entitled to women, and it's how they express their sense of masculinity. Crimes against women are simply seen as less important because women are not as important in society.\"28\n[17] However, the historical and current reality for women does not prevent cisgender straight men and boys from facing GBV. On the contrary, the GBV experienced by men, women, and members of the LGBTIQ community is connected. When men are targeted, the aim is often to emasculate or feminize. This is connected to a view that femininity is inferior to masculinity. As stated by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, (IASC) in their Guidelines for Integrating Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action:\nThe term 'gender-based violence' is also increasingly used by some actors to highlight the gendered dimensions of certain forms of violence against men and boys-particularly some forms of sexual violence committed with the explicit purpose of reinforcing gender inequitable norms of masculinity and femininity (e.g. sexual violence committed in armed conflict aimed at emasculating or feminizing the enemy). This violence against males is based on socially constructed ideas of what it means to be a man and exercise male power. It is used by men (and in rare cases by women) to cause harm to other males. As with violence against women and girls, this violence is often under-reported due to issues of stigma for the survivor-in this case associated with norms of masculinity (e.g. norms that discourage male survivors from acknowledging vulnerability, or suggest that a male survivor is somehow weak for having been assaulted) [emphases added].29\n[18] Having assessed all the evidence, I find that the Appellant has established a nexus to a Convention ground based on his particular social group, given his perceived non-conformity with socially accepted gender norms for men in Mexico.\nThe Appellant has established a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico\n[19] I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Mexico and that his fears are well-founded.\n[20] The Appellant is a survivor of intimate partner violence. He was initially targeted by his ex-spouse and subjected to verbal and physical abuse. After the end of the relationship, the abuse continued when he was threatened on multiple occasions by his abuser's family members. The abuse culminated in a physical assault at gunpoint. In my view, there is a pattern of events that are connected, and which threaten the Appellant's physical and moral integrity.30 I find that the seriousness and persistence of the harm renders the Appellant's experience of GBV persecutory in nature.31\n[21] In my review of the NDP for Mexico, I note that there is little objective evidence regarding the prevalence of GBV against men by their intimate partners. However, I have not drawn an adverse inference on this basis. The updated Gender Guideline cautions that \"Gender-based violence involving men and boys is generally under-reported and therefore country condition information may be scarce.\"32 Accepting the Appellant's allegations as credible, I find that his claim is well-founded and that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico.\nThe RPD's IFA finding is in error\n[22] The RPD identified Cabo San Lucas, M\u00e9rida, and Mexico City as viable IFA locations. Once an IFA is proposed, it is the Claimants' burden to adduce evidence to show, on a balance of probabilities: (i) that they face a serious possibility of persecution or a subsection 97(1) risk in the IFA; or (ii) that it would be objectively unreasonable, in their personal circumstances, to relocate to the IFA.33 The RPD properly set out this test in its decision.34 It is not the RPD or the RAD's job to prove or establish that the IFA location is safe or reasonable; the burden is on the Claimant.\n[23] The RPD found that Cabo San Lucas, M\u00e9rida, and Mexico City are viable IFAs under both prongs of the test. The Appellant argues that the RPD's IFA assessment is incorrect. Having independently assessed the complete RPD Record, I find that the Appellant does not have a viable IFA in Mexico. I find that the persecutors have the means and motivation to locate the Appellant in Mexico and there is no IFA under the first prong of the test. I find that the Appellant's right to seek access to his children, who are in the care of his abusive ex-spouse in Mexico, places him at a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[24] The persecutors have targeted the Appellant multiple times. He has been threatened with a gun and physically assaulted. He has also been tracked to his children's school. In my view, this is significant. While the RPD is correct that the Appellant has not been targeted since he left Mexico,35 I note that he has not sought access to his children since leaving Mexico in fear that this will alert his persecutors to his location.36 The Gender Guideline requires that I consider whether the family law system in Mexico provides an avenue for the Appellant's abusive ex-spouse to continue her abuse.37 In the circumstances of this appeal, the abuser and her family members have already demonstrated the desire and ability to target the Appellant when he attempts to have contact with his children. In my view, this is significant.\n[25] The Gender Guideline is clear that \"[i]f the agent of harm could locate the claimant through a family member, the claimant is not expected to cease communication with that family member.\"38 The Appellant cannot be expected to avoid seeking custody of, or access to, his children to remain safe.39 The IRB's Response to Information Request (RIR) indicates that a parent in a Mexican family law proceeding can request that a judge order government institutions to search their databases for the contact information of an estranged parent, \"including the address where the person can be located.\"40 In my view, the family law system provides an avenue for the continuation of abuse, establishing a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellant in Mexico.\n[26] Based on my independent assessment of the entire Record, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the persecutors possess the motivation and means to locate the Appellant throughout Mexico, including in the proposed IFA locations. I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Cabo San Lucas, M\u00e9rida, and Mexico City.\nThe Appellant does not have access to operationally adequate state protection in Mexico\n[27] Having independently assessed the complete Record, I find that the Appellant does not have access to operationally adequate state protection upon return to Mexico.\n[28] The Appellant unsuccessfully sought assistance from the authorities in Mexico. As previously explained at paragraph 10 of these Reasons, when the Appellant went to file a denunciation at the police station, they laughed at him and referred to him using a pejorative feminine term, meaning that he was 'overpowered by a woman.'41 This supports a finding that operationally adequate state protection would not be forthcoming for him upon return to Mexico.\n[29] In my review of the NDP for Mexico, I note that there is little objective evidence regarding the police's treatment of men who have experienced intimate partner violence. However, I have not drawn an adverse inference on this basis given the scarcity of country condition information for men GBV survivors in Mexico.42 Accepting the Appellant's allegations as credible, I find that his experience with the authorities in Mexico demonstrates an unwillingness to take men GBV survivors seriously.\n[30] I also note that the NDP indicates that there are \"extremely low rates of prosecution\" in Mexico.43 Municipal and state level police are ineffective, and they lack the resources to investigate crimes and victims may be required to gather evidence themselves and pay police officers to secure an arrest.44 While Mexico has taken steps to combat GBV, there are significant gaps in implementation and laws addressing domestic violence are not effectively enforced.45\n[31] In the Appellant's circumstances, the persecutors have threatened to use their connections to the state if he disobeys them and seeks protection. The objective evidence indicates that organized criminal groups are \"implicated in numerous killings, acting with impunity and at times in collusion with corrupt federal, state, local, and security officials.\"46 Indeed, it is estimated that \"80 percent of police forces are [translation] 'controlled' by criminals [] or 'almost 60 or 70 percent' are 'corrupted' by organized crime.\"47\n[32] I acknowledge that Los Zetas is no longer as powerful as it once was during the peak of its dominance in 2011 and 2012 and that it now occupies a \"patchwork of territory\" across the country.48 However, Los Zetas remains one of the dominant and largest criminal organizations in Mexico.49 Los Zetas is reconstituting its sophisticated communication networks and it uses ground-level informants, such as taxi drivers, food vendors, and police, and it employs \"hundreds of lookouts\" to gather information.50 Los Zetas also operates through strategic alliances with other more powerful cartels, and they rely on corrupt state authorities to obtain information about those they pursue.51\n[33] Based on my independent assessment, I find that the evidence is clear and convincing and rebuts the presumption of state protection in the Appellant's circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nAugust 18, 2022\nDate\n1 Personal identifiers have been removed, except where necessary to explain the reasoning of the decision.\n2 RPD hearing transcript, February 15, 2022, at p. 9, at lines 25-33.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended, at ss. 110(6).\n4 Canada (MCI) v.

If forced to return to the Philippines, she fears violence from her husband. She also believes she will face risks from the individual who killed her husband's friend in 2007, will face risks from the police due to the ongoing war on drugs, and will be forcibly evicted by the government from the property on which her family has been living. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) refused her claim for protection. It found she had not credibly established the violence from her husband and therefore did not have a well-founded fear of persecution on that basis. The RPD also found she did not credibly establish the threats related to her husband's friend's murder in 2007. Further, the RPD found the risks from police or forced eviction did not amount to a personal risk as required by section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA). Ms. XXXX challenges the RPD's finding about the allegations regarding her husband. She has not challenged the RPD's decision about the threats related to the 2007 murder or the risks related to the war on drugs or forcible eviction.\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. Although I do not agree with all of the RPD's credibility findings, I agree with its conclusion that Ms. XXXX has not established the allegations of violence or harm from her husband, on a balance of probabilities. I also agree with the RPD's unchallenged findings regarding the threats related to the 2007 murder and the risks related to the war on drugs or forcible eviction. I confirm the RPD's decision that Ms. XXXX is neither a Convention2 refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[3] I applied the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board (Guideline 4), effective July 18, 2022, in deciding this appeal.3\nNEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\nNew evidence accepted\n[4] Section 110(4) of the IRPA4 states an Appellant may present evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim, that was not reasonably available, or that could not reasonably have been expected to be presented at the time of the rejection. Where evidence meets the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) will then consider the newness, relevance, and credibility of the evidence.5\n[5] Ms. XXXX submits an article from 2003 titled \"Understanding Women's Responses to Domestic Violence\" as new evidence on appeal.6\n[6] I admit the article as new evidence.\n[7] The article did not arise after the RPD decision as it was published in 2003, which pre-dates the RPD's decision by nearly 20 years. I have no submissions to explain why the article was not reasonably available when the RPD rejected the claim and see none arising on the record before me. Ms. XXXX submits she could not reasonably have been expected to present the article before the RPD rejected her claim. She submits (1) the article is written in academic English and is beyond her comprehension level and (2) she was unrepresented at the RPD hearing, so was unaware the trauma she experienced would affect her credibility, was unaware of the extent of her trauma, and without representation or support from a psychologist it would be unreasonable for her to have relied on this evidence prior to the hearing.\n[8] The RAD's role is not to provide an opportunity to complete a deficient record before the RPD and claimants must put their best foot forward before the RPD.7 Claimants before the RPD do not have an absolute right to counsel, but rather an absolute right to fair proceedings.8 There is a heightened obligation for the RPD and the RAD to ensure the fairness of the proceedings for unrepresented parties.9 In Ms. XXXX case, she completed her Basis of Claim (BOC) form with the assistance of counsel, but was unrepresented before the RPD. As explained in more detail below, the RPD was mindful of Ms. XXXX circumstances and appropriately accommodated her. Realizing Ms. XXXX was not familiar with the disclosure requirements, the RPD also provided her the opportunity to file supporting evidence after the hearing. It cannot be said that the RPD conducted its hearing in a procedurally unfair manner.\n[9] However, I agree with Ms. XXXX that she was not aware how the RPD would assess her testimony about her husband. Specifically, the RPD found her credibility was undermined because she expressed a desire to reunite with him. I find Ms. XXXX could not have anticipated this reason for doubting her credibility, and thus it was not reasonable to expect her to provide this evidence before the RPD refused her claim. I also find the article meets the credibility, relevance, and newness requirements. The article is from a published research journal and is a credible source of information. It is relevant and new in that it addresses a credibility finding by the RPD.\nNo oral hearing\n[10] I have accepted new evidence, so I considered whether I should convene an oral hearing. According to section 110(6) of the IRPA,10 the RAD may hold an oral hearing if there is new evidence that raises a serious issue of credibility with the person who is the subject of the appeal, that is central to the decision of the claim, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim.11 If all three of these factors are met, the RAD has discretion to hold an oral hearing.\n[11] The new evidence does not raise a serious issue related to Ms. XXXX credibility and would also not justify allowing or rejecting the claim. I have accepted that the concepts in the article assist in finding the RPD erred in one of its credibility findings, but this finding is not determinative of Ms. XXXX credibility or the claim. I conclude the factors in section 110(6) of the IRPA are not met and I will not hold an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[12] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.12\n[13] The determinative issue in this appeal is whether Ms. XXXX has established her allegations, on balance of probabilities.\nRPD was correct Ms. XXXX did not establish allegations of violence from her husband, on a balance of probabilities\nRPD's reasons\n[14] The RPD found Ms. XXXX was not the victim of domestic violence, on a balance of probabilities. It drew negative inferences from the omission of any fear of her husband in her BOC form; her convoluted, vague, and inconsistent testimony; and her contradictory testimony that she wants to reunite with her husband in Canada if granted protection. It gave limited weight to the pictures submitted post-hearing because there was no evidence identifying the individuals in the pictures or the context in which the pictures were taken. It gave limited weight to text messages from her daughter submitted post-hearing because the messages were unclear and the events described are difficult to follow. The RPD also found Ms. XXXX delay in claiming protection undermined her subjective fear. It concluded Ms. XXXX provided insufficient evidence to establish that she faces a serious possibility of persecution from her husband in the Philippines.\nMs. XXXX submissions\n[15] Ms. XXXX challenges the RPD's conclusion that she was not credible about the harm she fears from her husband. She submits the conclusion her testimony was vague, convoluted, and inconsistent is wrong because the RPD did not consider the impact of trauma on her ability to explain her circumstances clearly and consistently. She also submits the hearing process was unfamiliar and stressful and the experience was overwhelming. She submits the RPD should have considered allowing her to make written or video submissions or to complete her hearing before a Member specially trained in claims involving gender related persecution.\n[16] Ms. XXXX further submits it was an error for the RPD to find her credibility undermined because she indicated a possible desire to reunite with her husband in Canada. She submits it is not unreasonable for women who have experienced domestic abuse to express a desire to maintain the relationship and it should not have been held against her credibility as it is contrary to Guideline 4. She also submits the Member should have provided accommodations based on suspicions Ms. XXXX was exhibiting symptoms of Battered Woman Syndrome.\n[17] Ms. XXXX submits the RPD erred in assessing the post-hearing evidence. She submits the pictures and messages should carry more weight \"under the presumption of credibility.\"13 She submits this was the best evidence she could provide about the abuse since her husband would have prevented any other attempts to gather evidence. She also submits the meaning of the message from her daughter was clear even if the syntax was difficult to follow.\nRAD's independent assessment\n[18] For the following reasons, I find Ms. XXXX has not established her allegations of violence from her husband, on a balance of probabilities.\ni. RPD applied principles of Guideline 4 and appropriately accommodated Ms. XXXX during the proceeding\n[19] Ms. XXXX submits the RPD ought to have made further accommodations for her in accordance with Guideline 4 and in recognition of her vulnerabilities as someone who has experienced gender-based violence. She submits she should have been able to complete her hearing in front of someone trained in claims involving gender related persecution, make written or video submissions, and been given other accommodations.\n[20] I find the RPD conducted the hearing in accordance with the principles in Guideline 4 and appropriately accommodated Ms. XXXX.\n[21] Ms. XXXX was unrepresented at the RPD hearing. I find the RPD ensured Ms. XXXX understood the nature of the proceedings and explained the process and issues in her claim. The RPD was not required to reconvene the hearing to someone trained in claims involving gender related persecution. Although there is a Gender Related Task Force at the RPD where members receive supplementary training on gender-related claims,14 all RPD members are required to conduct claims involving gender related persecution with a trauma-informed approach. I find the RPD did so during Ms. XXXX hearing. While the RPD asked questions about the violence from Ms. XXXX husband, this was appropriate as these allegations were raised for the first time at the start of the hearing. Given the inquisitorial nature of the proceedings, the RPD was correct to ask questions about the allegations to find out if they formed a basis for granting protection. Throughout its questions, the RPD was patient and respectful. At several points during the hearing, the RPD checked it was understanding Ms. XXXX testimony correctly to avoid confusion.15 When Ms. XXXX became emotional describing her children's circumstances, the RPD offered breaks and treated her with dignity. I note that Ms. XXXX testified both in English and with the assistance of an interpreter. The RPD confirmed Ms. XXXX understood this was her choice and was alert to ensuring she understood the questions when she was answering without the assistance of an interpreter. I find the RPD created a fair and safe adjudicative environment for Ms. XXXX to present her testimony.\n[22] Ms. XXXX also submits she should have been able to make written or video submissions or been given other accommodations. The RPD provided Ms. XXXX the opportunity to submit evidence after the hearing and accepted her written submissions. It also gave her the opportunity to give remarks at the end of the hearing (which was by video), which Ms. XXXX did not do. Ms. XXXX has not specified what other accommodations should have been provided. I find the RPD appropriately accommodated Ms. XXXX circumstances by allowing her to provide written submissions and post-hearing evidence.\nii. Unchallenged RPD findings\n[23] The RPD found the omission of the violence from her husband from the BOC form undermined Ms. XXXX credibility. It also found Ms. XXXX delay from when she arrived in Canada with a work permit in 2014 to when she made her claim for protection in May 2019 undermined her subjective fear. Ms. XXXX has not challenged these findings on appeal.\n[24] I agree with the RPD's reasoning and conclusion about the omission from her BOC form, with one correction. The RPD stated Ms. XXXX completed the BOC form herself, but she in fact completed the BOC form with the assistance of counsel.16 In my view, this further supports the conclusion that the omission of this entire allegation from the BOC form is not adequately explained. Additionally, I agree with the RPD that Ms. XXXX explanation that she omitted the information because she was late in submitting her BOC form and then learned she could add information at the hearing does not explain the omission of such important information from the BOC form. I also do not find trauma or its aftereffects explain the omission, as Ms. XXXX has not submitted her experiences prevented her from disclosing these allegations to her previous counsel or in the BOC form. This is also not a situation where only some details were omitted from the BOC form or some events were disclosed and some were omitted. Rather, the entire allegation was omitted from the BOC form. The violence from her husband is material as it forms an entire basis for her claim. I find the material omission undermines the credibility of Ms. XXXX allegation of violence from her husband.\n[25] I do not agree with the RPD that the timing of Ms. XXXX claim for protection undermines her credibility. The Federal Court is clear that it \"is only unexplained delay after the fear has crystalized and after it was possible to seek protection that can reasonably support an inference that the claim of subjective fear should not be believed because of the delay in seeking protection.\"17 Ms. XXXX testified she did not claim protection after she lost temporary status because she was not aware it was an option. She testified it was only after she contacted a lawyer that she was advised of the possibility.18 I find this credible, on a balance of probabilities. However, the evidence is unclear about when Ms. XXXX contacted the lawyer and learned of the ability to claim protection. Given this gap in the evidence, I do not have the information needed to determine when Ms. XXXX learned of the opportunity to make a refugee claim and whether there is any unexplained delay to when she took up that opportunity. It would be wrong for me to draw a negative inference related to the timing of her claim in the absence of such evidence and I have not done so.\niii. Ms. XXXX testimony, submissions, and documents\n[26] I agree with Ms. XXXX that the RPD erred by finding her desire to potentially reunite with her husband in Canada was inconsistent with her subjective fear and undermined her credibility. Such a finding is wrong because it relies on the incorrect assumption that persons in abusive relationships will not return to an abuser or associate with them after traumatic events.19 I do not find Ms. XXXX testimony about potentially reuniting with her husband in Canada undermines her credibility.\n[27] The RPD characterized Ms. XXXX testimony and written submissions as convoluted, vague, and inconsistent. I have reviewed the record and find Ms. XXXX testimony was vague.\n[28] When asked directly by the RPD if he was physically abusive towards her, Ms. XXXX stated, \"Yes, before, ma'am, when he is a drunk. He cannot control anything. He is emotion, and he is by his self...\"20 Later, she testified when her husband is drunk, he \"can do physical\" to her.21 However, she did not provide further details and testified about her husband's mistreatment of her sons and daughters, including his anger towards the youngest daughter's boyfriend who is involved with drugs.22 She later explained she is scared of her husband,23 but then also testified if he located her and her children in the proposed IFAs he would not hurt her.24 Ms. XXXX post-hearing submissions are equally as vague. Much of the submissions focus on the insecurity in the Philippines and her family's difficult situation,25 although some parts mention her husband's mistreatment of their children and Ms. XXXX belief he will attack her if she argues with him about them.26\n[29] I have considered whether trauma could have impacted Ms. XXXX ability to testify clearly and consistently, as she submits on appeal. I note the RPD asked Ms. XXXX many different questions to elicit testimony and gave her numerous opportunities to clarify her evidence and provide details, including the opportunity to provide post-hearing submissions and evidence. Her testimony remained vague and lacking details. There is no evidence that Ms. XXXX has any medical conditions that would impact her ability to testify or her memory, but I recognize experiences of trauma undoubtedly affect a person whether or not they have a medical diagnosis.27 Taking this possibility into account, I do not draw a negative inference from Ms. XXXX vague testimony. However, I am still left with vague testimony when assessing whether Ms. XXXX allegations are established. The considerations in Guideline 4 and the acknowledgement of how trauma can impact testimony do not change the requirements for allegations to be established on a balance of probabilities.\n[30] Ms. XXXX submitted supporting documents after the hearing, which the RPD gave limited weight. On appeal, Ms. XXXX submits the RPD should have given the documents more weight \"under the presumption of credibility.\"28 The presumption of credibility of a claimant's sworn testimony, expressed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado,29 does not apply to documentary evidence. Rather, when considering documentary evidence, the RPD and RAD consider the weight to be given to documents by assessing their credibility and probative value.30 I agree with the RPD that the photographs should be given limited weight. I do not doubt their credibility, but they have low probative value towards establishing violence from Ms. XXXX husband. This is because the photographs of the daughter's self-harm and the son's abrasions do not tend to prove violence or harm from Ms. XXXX husband. The daughter's injuries are not alleged to be from Ms. XXXX husband, and it is not clear how the son got the abrasions.31 Contrary to the RPD, I find the text messages from Ms. XXXX daughter should be given moderate weight. I do not doubt the credibility of the messages, in that they come from Ms. XXXX daughter named XXXX XXXX. However, I do not agree with the submissions that the messages clearly establish Ms. XXXX experienced violence from her husband. The messages appear to have been sent by XXXX XXXX after an incident of self-harm; they are understandably distraught and somewhat disjointed. I find the text messages have moderate probative value because although they mention \"hurting\" and \"physical abuse\" related to Ms. XXXX, they are very vague. In other words, they have only moderate value towards proving violence or harm from Ms. XXXX husband because they are vague about the referenced events. Finally, Ms. XXXX submits these documents were the best available evidence she could provide. Neither the RPD nor I have found Ms. XXXX credibility undermined because of the kinds of documentary evidence submitted. Rather, both the RPD and I have assessed the submitted documents to determine the weight to give to them and whether they are sufficient to establish her claim.\n[31] Overall, I find there is very little testimony regarding violence from Ms. XXXX husband and the available testimony is vague. The photographs submitted after the hearing show difficult situations for her children, but I give them limited weight towards establishing violence or harm from Ms. XXXX husband. I give the text messages from her daughter moderate weight towards establishing violence or harm from Ms. XXXX husband.\niv. RAD conclusion on allegations of violence from husband\n[32] I have found the RPD conducted the hearing in accordance with the principles in Guideline 4 and appropriately accommodated Ms. XXXX. I have found the RPD was correct to find the omission of the violence from her husband undermines the credibility of the allegations, but erred in finding the timing of her claim undermined her subjective fear. I have also found Ms. XXXX testimony was vague, despite numerous opportunities to clarify her evidence and provide details. I have given the photographs limited weight and the text messages moderate weight towards establishing violence or harm from Ms. XXXX husband. When considered in totality, the vague testimony and documents are insufficient to establish the allegations of violence or harm from her husband, on a balance of probabilities.\n[33] The RPD was correct in finding Ms. XXXX has not established her allegations of violence or harm from her husband, on a balance of probabilities. It follows I also find the RPD was correct in finding Ms. XXXX has provided insufficient evidence to establish that she faces a serious possibility of persecution from her husband in the Philippines.\nOther unchallenged findings\n[34] Ms. XXXX has not challenged the RPD's findings about the threats related to the 2007 murder of her husband's friend, the risks related to the war on drugs in the Philippines, or the risks related to the forcible eviction by the government from the property on which her family has been living. As the Federal Court has held, \"[t]he RAD is not required to provide reasons for unchallenged findings.\"32 I note, however, that I have reviewed the findings and agree with the RPD's reasoning and conclusions.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] I dismiss the appeal. I confirm the decision of the RPD that Ms. XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[36] From Ms. XXXX testimony and written submissions, it is evident she wants to protect her children from what she believes are unsafe and insecure situations in the Philippines, provide for her children financially, and offer her children opportunities for their future in Canada. Although I have not found she is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, I have compassion for Ms. XXXX and her children.\n(signed)\nxxxx\nxxxx\nSeptember 21, 2022\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, section 97(1)(b).\n2 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, Geneva, 28 July 1951, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 189, at p. 137 and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, New York, 31 January 1967, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 606, at p. 267; accession of Canada to both on 4 June 1969.\n3 Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, Effective July 18, 2022.\n4 IRPA, section 110(4).\n5 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected their claims because they had permanent residence in Ecuador. Specifically, the Appellants were excluded from refugee protection because if they had status in a safe country, they did not need Canada's protection. The RPD found that though the Appellants faced discrimination in Ecuador, it was not enough to render it unsafe for them under s. 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The Appellants appealed that decision to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). They argued that the RPD was wrong in its assessment of the treatment they faced in Ecuador.\n[3] On the date of the RPD hearing, the Appellants were permanent residents of Ecuador. At that time, they were permitted to be outside of the country for five years without losing their residency. This status was valid to XXXX 2023. Since the date of the RPD hearing, indeed even after filing their appeal to the RAD, immigration laws in Ecuador changed. On appeal, the Appellants presented new evidence that Ecuador now only permits permanent residents to live outside of the country for two years. This change would mean that the Appellants lost their status in Ecuador shortly after filing appeal to the RAD in XXXX 2020. They also presented as new evidence confirmation from the General Consulate of Ecuador in Canada that they no longer have status in that country.\n[4] This raised a novel question of law. The leading case in this area, Majebi,1 is clear that in most instances, the RAD evaluates the question of exclusion under Article 1E as of the date of the RPD hearing. No case law, however, has squarely answered whether this remains true if there is admissible new evidence that status had been lost after the RPD hearing. The Federal Court of Appeal acknowledged the need for the RAD to answer this question for itself in Abel.2\n[5] Having considered the jurisprudence, I find that the Majebi test must be understood in concert with the RAD's statutory power to admit new evidence that passes stringent criteria. New evidence, in some circumstances, may be capable of proving a fact unknown or unforeseen at the time of the RPD hearing. This evidence, if not weighed, leads to incoherent results in the asylum determination system. Consideration of a change in status does not mean an individual cannot be, ultimately, excluded. Rather, it means additional analysis is required to answer that question.\n[6] For this reason, as I will explain, I find that in the circumstances of this case, new evidence that demonstrates an unforeseen change in the Appellants' status in Ecuador should be considered. The assessment of their status should be done as of the date of the RAD's consideration of the appeal, and not as of the date of the RPD hearing.\n[7] I conclude that the Appellants lost their status in Ecuador. This was based upon a change in law since the date of the RPD hearing, and the loss was confirmed by consular officials. When I balanced the facts of this case, applying the Zeng3 test, I found that they weighed against exclusion. The Appellants face a serious possibility of persecution in their native Cuba. For these reasons, I accept their claims.\nDECISION\n[8] The appeal is allowed. The Appellants are Convention Refugees.\nBACKGROUND\n[9] The Appellants are citizens of Cuba and held permanent residency in Ecuador.\n[10] The Principal Appellant does not agree with the political system in Cuba. He alleges that he voiced criticisms at university, at work, and in his private life. He received warnings from the school, from his employer, and finally threats from unknown men and, later, agents of the state. For all of these reasons, he and his wife, the Associate Appellant, moved to Ecuador in 2015 and became permanent residents.\n[11] While living in Ecuador, both Appellants were able to work. The Principal Appellant co-XXXX a XXXX where he was the XXXX and XXXX XXXX.4 While in Ecuador, the Principal Appellant began a XXXX where he XXXX XXXX regarding the XXXX and XXXX situation in Cuba.5\n[12] The Appellants allege that they suffered discrimination in Ecuador. In particular, the Associate Appellant is an Afro-Cuban woman, and experienced racism based upon the colour of her skin. They had returned to Cuba to visit family on two occasions but decided to leave Ecuador for good on XXXX XXXX, 2018. On XXXX XXXX, 2019, they entered Canada and made a refugee claim shortly thereafter.\n[13] While in Canada, the Principal Appellant posted in opposition to the government in Cuba on social media.6\n[14] The RPD heard the Appellants' claims on February 7, 2020 and issued its decision on June 19, 2020. The RPD determined that the Appellants were excluded under Article 1E of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees7 because they had permanent residence in Ecuador. The RPD found that though the Appellants had experienced discrimination in Ecuador, it did not rise to the level of persecution. Their claims were rejected.\n[15] The Appellants appealed this decision to the RAD, arguing that Ecuador was not safe for them.\n[16] In April 2021, upon considering this file, I sent the Appellants a notice that I would be considering the latest National Documentation Package (NDP) for Ecuador and asking if they had submissions. The Appellants responded in May 2021 with evidence that since the RPD hearing, Ecuador had changed its immigration laws. The time that a permanent resident could be outside of the country without losing their status had been reduced from five years to two years. Instead of having status valid until XXXX 2023, the Appellants lost their status in Ecuador in XXXX 2020.\n[17] The question of a change in status after the RPD hearing was before the Federal Court of Appeal in Abel.8 After having the benefit of the Court of Appeal's decision in Abel, and since the new evidence presented by the Appellants fundamentally changed the nature of the appeal, on December 17, 2021, I gave notice to the Appellants and the Minister that I would be considering the following questions. I provided the Appellants' new evidence and submissions of May 2021 to the Minister:\nPursuant to the decision of the Federal Court in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Alazar, 2021 FC 637, the RAD is providing notice to the Minister and the Appellants that it may consider a new issue on appeal. The RAD is also providing the Minister with a copy of the new evidence and submissions from the Appellants. The new issue(s) is\/are as follows:\n* Based upon the new evidence provided by the Appellants, have they lost their status in Ecuador?\n* What is the RAD's jurisdiction to consider this evidence, given the Federal Court of Appeal's decisions in Majebi v. Canada (MCI), 2016 FCA 274 and Abel c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2021 CAF 131?\n* If the RAD does have jurisdiction, what are the Appellants' or the Minister's submissions on the criteria enumerated in Canada (MCI) v. Zeng, 2010 FCA 118 at paragraph 28?\n* What present risk do the Appellants face in Cuba? If the RAD assesses the risk in Cuba, it will consider the most recent NDP for Cuba dated 29 September 2021.9\n[18] The deadline for response was thirty days in view of the holiday period.\n[19] On December 20, 2021, the Minister responded seeking a duplicate copy of the Appellants' record.10 This was provided electronically on the same day.11\n[20] On January 13, 2022, the Appellants responded with submissions. They also provided additional new evidence: correspondence with the Ecuadorian Consulate confirming that they are no longer permanent residents of that country.12 In view of the Appellants' response, I advised the Minister that they had a further two weeks to respond.13\n[21] The NDP for Cuba was updated on July 29, 2022. On October 3, 2022, I provided the Minister with notice that I would be considering this updated information and that I did not need to hear from the Appellants on the issue.14 Any response to this notice on the Minister's part was due by October 17, 2022.\n[22] As of today's date, I have received no response from the Minister. Having sent multiple notices, I am satisfied that procedural fairness was ensured and I proceeded to a decision.\nNEW EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE\n[23] I find that the new evidence presented is admissible.\n[24] The Appellants presented the following new evidence on May 22, 2021:\na. Organic Reform Law of the Organic Law of Human Mobility dated February 4, 2021, and copy of former law for comparison15\nb. Article - Ecuador: National Assembly Approves Immigration Reform Bill, dated February 25, 202116\n[25] They presented the following new evidence on January 13, 2022:\na. Correspondence with the General Consulate of Ecuador in Toronto, dated January 6 to 11, 2022.17\n[26] This evidence was not presented at the time the Appellants perfected their appeal, but in response to the notices I sent. Since the May 22, 2021 evidence was not responsive to the notice of a new NDP for Ecuador, I considered whether this evidence was permissible under RAD Rule 29. Though the evidence was not available at the time the Appellants provided their record, it could, with reasonable effort, have been provided in a more timely fashion. I also note that the January 13, 2022 evidence could have been provided earlier, rather than in response to my second notice. There is no reason that the Appellants could not have been in contact with the consulate in May 2021 with their submissions at that time, and they have not clarified when they became aware of the change in the law. This being said, the relevance, probative value, and new evidence that these documents bring to the appeal are undeniable, as I will address. These factors outweigh any delay on the part of the Appellants in providing them.\n[27] There are restrictions on the types of new evidence that the Appellants can submit on appeal. Subsection 110(4) of IRPA states that I can only accept evidence from the person who is the subject of the appeal that arose after the RPD decision, or that was not reasonably available at the time of the RPD decision, or that could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to present to the RPD before the decision.\n[28] Ecuador changed its immigration laws in February 2021, well after the RPD's decision in June 2020. Therefore, I find that the law, the article about the change, and the subsequent correspondence with the Ecuadorian consulate all arose after the RPD's decision in this case. For this reason, these documents meet the requirements of s. 110(4) to be admitted.\n[29] The Appellants also provided Ecuador's previous immigration law for comparison's sake. This document was not in the country documentation before the RPD. I accept that, since they had residency in Ecuador at the time of the RPD hearing, there was no need to provide this evidence earlier. I find that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to present this document to the RPD. This also meets the requirements of s.110(4) for admissibility.\n[30] All of this evidence is also sufficiently new, credible, and relevant for the purposes of admissibility.18 The evidence is new, as it demonstrates a change in an important fact.\n[31] This evidence is credible. The laws are documents published by the state of Ecuador. The article dated February 25, 2021 comes from a named source, and is largely based on the information in the text of the law. The Appellants' correspondence with the Ecuadorian consulate is credible on its face. The email provides contact information, and is the addresses used are the same as are shown on evidence before the RPD that confirmed valid status at that time.19\n[32] Finally, the evidence is relevant to the question of exclusion, which is central to this appeal. The evidence demonstrates that the RPD decision has been rendered factually incorrect because of the change in Ecuador's immigration laws.\n[33] Therefore, I find that the new evidence satisfies RAD Rule 29, as well as the statutory and jurisprudential requirements. The documents are admitted.\nNO ORAL HEARING HELD\n[34] Though the Appellants, in their original record, request that the RAD hold an oral hearing, I cannot do so. The RAD can only hold an oral hearing in very particular circumstances: new evidence admitted raises serious credibility concerns that are determinative of the claim.20\n[35] In this case, I accept that the contents of the new evidence are credible. The conditions to hold an oral hearing are not met. This case turned on my evaluation of the law and my application of the law to the facts, which I accept are credible.\nANALYSIS\n[36] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.21 In this case, because of the new evidence, I find that the RPD decision is wrong.\nThe RAD can consider new evidence demonstrating that the Appellants have lost their status in Ecuador since the time of the RPD hearing\n[37] Though I understand that it is novel, I find that I may consider the fact that new evidence demonstrates that the Appellants have lost their permanent residency in Ecuador. The effect of the loss of status is that I must do an additional assessment under the third prong of the Zeng test to decide if they are still excluded from refugee protection.\nZeng, Majebi, and Abel are the leading cases\n[38] If a refugee has or has had residency in a third country, we must decide if they are excluded from protection because they already have somewhere safe to live.22 This is based upon Article 1E of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees23 and is incorporated directly into Canadian law by s. 98 of IRPA. The Federal Court of Appeal has considered this issue and given the following guidance.\n[39] In Zeng, the Court of Appeal set out a test for how to approach this question, even in cases where someone may have lost a status or failed to acquire it. Zeng found that the time we evaluate an individual's status in another country (I will call this the 1E country) \"must be fluid to ensure consideration is given to both the status and the actions of a claimant throughout.\"24 For this reason, the Court of Appeal rejected the notion that the status is only evaluated as of the date of the application for refugee protection. The Court specifically anticipated that \"a claimant's status could change between the date of the application and the date of the hearing\" and provided that such a change be considered in a timely evaluation of the status in the 1E country.25\n[40] The Court of Appeal then went on to consider the need to deter asylum shopping, and elaborated a framework of analysis for 1E cases, permitting exclusion in some instances even after a person's status in the 1E country has been lost. The three-pronged Zeng test remains the applicable analysis today:\na. Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded.\nb. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E.\nc. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to,\ni. the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary),\nii. whether the claimant could return to the third country,\niii. the risk the claimant would face in the home country,\niv. Canada's international obligations,\nv. and any other relevant facts.26 [my formatting]\n[41] The RAD, in its current form, was established on December 15, 2012 - after the Zeng decision. Since then, the Federal Court of Appeal has had two opportunities to comment upon the timing of the Article 1E exclusion analysis in light of the RAD's existence.\n[42] In Majebi, the Court of Appeal considered whether the RAD could reconsider the applicability of Article 1E on the basis of facts that arose after the RPD hearing. The Court held that, in accordance with Zeng, \"an assessment of exclusion under Article 1E is to be made at the time of the hearing before the Refugee Protection Division.\" However, the Court left open the possibility that where the RAD finds that the RPD decision was made in error, the RAD may reconsider the issue de novo.27\n[43] This same issue came before the Federal Court of Appeal in Abel.28 While Mr. Majebi had lost his status between the date of the RPD hearing and the date of the RPD decision, Mr. Abel purportedly lost his between the date of the RPD hearing and the date of the RAD decision. He had no evidence of a change in status. He had simply been outside of his country of residence long enough that the status had probably lapsed, based upon country documentation known at the time of the RPD hearing. Shortly before the Federal Court of Appeal considered the matter, Mr. Abel was granted permanent residency in Canada through other means. For this reason, the Court determined that the appeal had become moot.29 The Court declined to exercise its discretion to hear the matter anyway, finding that \"there is no reason to believe that the issues raised in this case will escape judicial scrutiny and cannot be dealt with within a factual framework more conducive to their resolution\" [unofficial translation].30 The Court specifically left to the RAD the work of answering the certified question as reformulated by the Minister, as to whether the RAD can consider new evidence or new issues within the context of s. 98 of IRPA:\n[20] ... In my opinion, it would be wiser to first allow the RAD to decide on this matter, on the basis of a full factual record, even if it means subsequently assessing the reasonableness of the chosen solutions in a judicial review application context. [unofficial translation]31\n[44] This is just such a case.\nThe facts before me are not those before the FCA in Majebi and Abel: in this case, there is admissible new evidence about the 1E status that arose after the RPD hearing\n[45] In Majebi and Abel, the facts were different than those here. In those cases, the RAD had no admissible new evidence. The arguments about loss of status concerned only the passage of time. In those cases, the rules about how long someone could stay outside of the third country without losing permanent residence did not change and were known to the appellants at the time of their RPD hearings.\n[46] This is the argument that the Appellants have advanced. It would have been helpful to hear from the Minister on this point. On my own reading of the cases, I agree with the Appellants that Majebi and Abel do not seem to contemplate facts such as these - \"this is not a case of simple passage of time.\"32\n[47] In Majebi, the Appellants were citizens of Nigeria who lost their status between the date of the RPD hearing and the date of the RPD decision. They presented some new evidence about their loss of status, but this was dated well before the RPD decision and the RAD found that the evidence did not meet the criteria in s. 110(4) of the IRPA - it could and should have been presented to the RPD.\n[48] The facts before the Federal Court of Appeal in Majebi, therefore, are distinguishable from those before me.\n[49] The Federal Court of Appeal considered the issue again in Abel. Mr. Abel was both a citizen of Haiti and a permanent resident of Brazil at the time of the RPD hearing. He was excluded under Article 1E. By the time the RAD considered his appeal, Mr. Abel had lost his status by operation of Brazilian law (absent two years from the country). The Federal Court upheld the RAD's decision to rely on Majebi (FCA), and put significant emphasis on the fact that Mr. Abel presented no new evidence admissible under s. 110(4) of IRPA:\n[21] In addition, the RAD explained that it was applying Majebi [TRANSLATION] \"on the facts of this case\". The issues in each case are indeed similar. I disagree with the applicant's argument that the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Majebi is erroneous in light of the RAD's jurisdiction to assess new facts under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. In both Majebi and this case, the applicants did not provide new evidence relating to their status in their country of residence that meets the criteria of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. In Majebi, the Federal Court of Appeal found that it was reasonable for the RAD to have refused to consider the claimant's evidence that he had lost his permanent resident status because that evidence was available before the RPD made its decision. As such, the evidence was not \"new\" within the meaning of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. In this matter, the applicant relies on the National Documentation Package [NDP] to argue that he lost his status, without providing any new evidence, other than the passage of time, and there is no evidence from an expert (e.g., a lawyer) or an official of Brazil to prove that Mr. Abel is no longer a permanent resident. The NDP documents were before the RPD. This evidence, cited before the RAD, was therefore not new. The applicant's argument regarding the jurisdiction of the RAD under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA might be applicable if Mr. Abel had presented evidence that meets the requirements of that subsection of the IRPA and the case law.33 [my emphasis]\n[50] Moreover, part of the reason that the Federal Court certified a question in Abel was what it termed the RAD's \"blind\" following of Majebi without assessing whether the passage of time in conjunction with the NDP constituted new evidence.34\n[51] I note the significant discussion and weight placed by the Federal Court in Abel and Majebi on the absence of admissible new evidence. These are not the facts before me.\n[52] I have not found higher court case law that has considered facts where new evidence, admissible under s. 110(4) of IRPA, demonstrated a loss of status after the RPD hearing. The Federal Court has repeatedly stated that status in a 1E country is to be evaluated at the time of the RPD hearing, citing Majebi (FCA), but in none of these cases was there evidence of a change in status beyond the passage of time.35\nMy application of the Majebi decision\n[53] The Court of Appeal's decision in Majebi instructs that the question of exclusion is to be answered as of the date of the RPD hearing, unless the RAD concludes that the RPD decision was made in error. It is only when the RAD concludes that the RPD decision was made in error that the RAD may reconsider the issue of exclusion pursuant to Article 1E de novo. The RAD routinely applies the decision to cases where the facts as of the RAD's consideration are the same as those known at the time of the RPD hearing, though time may have passed.\n[54] Where the facts at the time of the RAD consideration are different, however, the RAD sometimes struggles to apply the Majebi decision.\na) Some new evidence must be relevant to the question of exclusion\n[55] It seems that some forms of new evidence must be relevant to the RAD's assessment of exclusion. Throughout this section, I envision evidence as some form of documentation. I do not comment on cases such as Majebi or Abel, where the only change in facts was the passage of time and its inevitable, foreseeable consequences.\n[56] Majebi is clear that \"an assessment of exclusion under Article 1E is to be made at the time of the hearing before the [RPD].\"36\n[57] Some of my colleagues have considered new evidence of a loss of status and found that the evidence is admissible. They have then limited consideration of it, however, to whether it demonstrated that the RPD was wrong about an appellant's status at the time of the RPD hearing. For example, in TB9-06059, the RAD admitted new evidence that demonstrated that at the time of the RPD hearing, the appellant had status. The RAD noted that the new evidence demonstrated that the status had since been cancelled but found that this fact could not be considered because of Majebi.37\n[58] The assessment of exclusion under Article 1E, however, involves two factual questions: that of the status in the 1E country (and application of the test in Zeng) and that of risk in the 1E country.\n[59] Though there was some recent debate about whether we ought to consider risk in the 1E country in determining exclusion under Article 1E, I adopt the reasons of my colleague in MB8-00025 on this point.38 The Federal Court of Appeal settled a matter on consent of the parties where this question was raised. The parties agreed that risk in the 1E country was a necessary part of the analysis of exclusion.39 Article 1E excludes those who have (and sometimes have had) surrogate protection elsewhere.40 Inherent in this question is that an individual does not face a well-founded fear of persecution or a risk as described in s. 97 in the 1E country; this would defeat the idea of surrogate protection.\n[60] The RAD is a safety net to catch mistakes made by the RPD.41 The Federal Court has been clear that the RAD has an obligation to consider the most recent NDP to ensure a timely risk assessment as of the time of the appeal.42 We must conduct an independent assessment of the record, which may include admissible new evidence that may raise new considerations.\n[61] It follows, then, that in deciding whether the 1E country is truly \"safe\", we ought to consider any relevant changes in the objective country documentation. This was the approach my colleague adopted in MB8-00025. In the majority of cases before the RAD, new NDPs do not demonstrate a material change in circumstances. In the few cases where they do, however, I do not see why the test set out in Majebi relieves us of the obligation to address risk in a prospective fashion. These cases would fall into the limited circumstances where the facts before the RAD, admissible under s. 110(4) as not having been available at the time of the RPD's decision, demonstrate that the RPD's conclusion is now erroneous. This is the safety net that the RAD provides.\n[62] The RAD routinely admits and considers evidence, such as a change in government in a refugee claimant's home country, that might render the RPD's decision wrong in light of new facts.\n[63] I note that, if we limited our risk assessment to the date of the RPD hearing, an individual may still have recourse to a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). The PRRA process is much more limited, however, and also has restrictions on evidence that may be presented. Its purpose is not to determine refugee protection. I rely on the comments of the court in Mwano and those of my colleague in MB8-00025 in this regard.43\n[64] I considered whether the test in Majebi ought to be read as meaning that the question of status in the 1E country must be determined as of the date of the RPD hearing, but that the question of risk was not similarly fixed in time.\n[65] The Federal Court of Appeal did not make this distinction, and it would seem to lead to a legal fiction. There would then be cases where new evidence relating to risk would be assessed, but new evidence of a loss of status would not. Assessing the new evidence on risk calls on the RAD to examine it, though in conjunction with the RPD record, anew. It would seem incoherent to have the RAD conduct a new, updated risk assessment for a country in which the Appellants no longer hold status and to where they may not be able to return. A PRRA officer would then have to conduct a risk assessment against the country of removal, which may be a different country entirely since the 1E status is lost. The RAD's updated risk assessment would not seem to serve a purpose in the asylum determination process.\n[66] It seems clear, based upon the RAD's obligations with respect to risk assessments that the assessment of risk in the 1E country cannot be fixed as of the date of the RPD hearing. I conclude that new evidence of risk must be relevant to this question of exclusion. But having followed a distinction between new evidence of risk and new evidence of status to its logical conclusion, I do not believe this is what the Federal Court of Appeal contemplated in Majebi.\n[67] It follows then that some new evidence, admitted under the strict statutory and jurisprudential criteria, must be relevant to the RAD's assessment of Article 1E exclusion under Majebi. I do not propose to provide an exhaustive review of the kind of new evidence that should be admissible in Article 1E cases. One unifying feature of a material change in country conditions about risk and, as here, a change in country conditions about foreign law, is the element of foreseeability. There is no deterrent effect for asylum shopping served by refusing to assess the change in status in the case before me, because it was not known or foreseen by the Appellants to lose status when they did.\nb) The meaning of the Court of Appeal's use of the term \"made in error\"\n[68] I also considered what quality of error would \"unlock\" the RAD's ability to consider the question of exclusion as of the date of the RAD's consideration of the appeal.\n[69] In the case before me, though it was not specifically argued, the RPD committed the same error as highlighted in Saint-Paul and in MB8-00025.44 It concluded that the Appellants were residents of Ecuador and therefore that they were excluded. After concluding its exclusion analysis, the RPD then went on to assess the risk that the Appellants faced in Ecuador.45\n[70] This is an error I can correct on appeal. It is simply a matter of the placement of the risk assessment as part of the analytical framework of Article 1E. In a great number of cases before the RAD, though the RPD has erred, we concur with the outcome and can correct the error on appeal.\n[71] If this error, however, were the type contemplated by the Court of Appeal in Majebi as allowing the RAD to reconsider exclusion as of the date of the RAD proceeding, it would seem a small distinction from a case where such a small error of sequence was not made.\n[72] To be clear, the RPD did make a legal error. However, if this is the quality of error that unlocks the Majebi test, it leads to a strange dichotomy. The Appellants in this case, who have lost their status since the date of the RPD hearing, would then be entitled to have the RAD consider the loss of status and conduct the balancing under the third prong of the Zeng test simply because the RPD made a sequencing error. An identical case, where the RPD conducted its risk assessment in the proper place, is limited to a consideration of exclusion as of the date of the RPD hearing. The Appellants whose claim is decided by the RPD member who made a mistake benefit from a whole analysis, and potentially a different conclusion on exclusion, than those for whom the RPD committed no error, despite identical facts and identical new evidence presented, can access.\n[73] Indeed, the case law on this issue is inconsistent. In MB8-00025, the RAD found that the RPD had committed the same error as it did in the case before me, but found that it was bound by Majebi and assessed the status as of the date of the RPD hearing.\n[74] I noted the decision of the Federal Court in Milfort-Laguere.46 In that case, the RPD did not exclude Ms. Milfort-Laguere, because though her name appeared on a list of individuals to whom the government of Brazil had granted the right to obtain permanent resident status, there was no prima facie evidence that she had taken steps to obtain that status. The RAD found that the RPD erred. The RAD found that Ms. Milfort-Laguere's name on the list was prime facie evidence that she had PR status in Brazil, and that the burden of proof was reversed. It was now Ms. Milfort-Laguere's onus to prove she did not have status. She did not bring any new evidence on this point to the RAD. She argued that she would automatically have lost any status because she had been gone from Brazil for over two years, and that Brazilian law meant that her status was now lost. The Court found that the RAD was reasonable to use the date of the RPD hearing as the relevant one.\n[75] In both of these cases, however, it would seem to me that, since the RPD erred, the exception carved out in Majebi applied and the RAD could have conducted the assessment of exclusion afresh.\n[76] My colleague in X (Re), 2019 CanLII 143590 (CA IRB)47 took this contrary approach. She found that since the RPD erred about its assessment of the status held in the 1E country, the assessment of exclusion would be as of the date of the RAD's consideration.\n[77] The Federal Court of Appeal held that the RAD could consider the question of exclusion de novo if the RPD decision was made in error; in so finding, the Court must not have meant an error in the ultimate conclusion on exclusion. If by \"made in error\" the Court of Appeal meant the ultimate conclusion on exclusion, then the RAD would not need to revisit the issue of exclusion de novo. The RAD, applying a standard of correctness, would conclude that the appellant was not excluded and proceed to the merits of the claim against the country of citizenship.\n[78] Smaller errors, then, in the constituent parts of the exclusion analysis, such as a mistake in the wording of the legal test, or the placement of the risk assessment, must be what Majebi contemplated.\n[79] The strange dichotomy, above, can be remedied by understanding new evidence in Article 1E cases the way the RAD understands it in others. I propose to do so on the facts of this case below.\nc) My interpretation of Majebi in light of the facts of this case\n[80] I find that the Majebi test is unlocked in this case, not only because the RPD made an error of where it did its risk assessment against Ecuador, but also in light of my assessment of the new evidence admitted. I find that this is consistent with the Court of Appeal's intention in Zeng to prevent asylum shopping and rewarding those who wait out their status until it is lost. Here is why.\n[81] The RAD's statutory power to admit new evidence is very limited and leaves no room for discretion on the part of the RAD.48 The criteria of newness, credibility, and relevance are only considered if one of the criteria in s. 110(4) is met.49\n[82] The reason we may admit new evidence, in such limited circumstances, is that there may be cases where the new evidence, reviewed in conjunction with the record before the RPD, changes the outcome of the refugee claim. On a standard of correctness, which the RAD must apply to the determination of the claim,50 the RAD may find the RPD decision is erroneous because it did not have the benefit of the evidence before the RAD. Indeed, a standard of correctness demands that the RAD decide the issues in the appeal \"exactly as it thinks it should\" and substitute its own conclusion if it ends up being different than that of the RPD.51\n[83] This is true of evidence that proves or disproves a fact at the time of the RPD hearing, as well as facts subsequent. For example, a significant change in country conditions after the RPD hearing may render the RPD's conclusions on risk wrong in light of new facts. In all other contexts, the RAD is obligated to look at new information as of the date of its decision. Failure to do so is a reviewable error.\n[84] Section 110(4) is an effective gatekeeper to address the concerns of asylum shopping articulated in Zeng. In this case, the evidence is of a change in law that substantially changed the length of time that the Appellants could be outside of Ecuador. The change was unknown to the Appellants at the time of the RPD hearing, and for this reason I found that it was admissible on appeal. This could be distinguished from the facts of Majebi, or Abel, as I have said, where the length of time the claimants could be outside of their country was known. Indeed, the new evidence presented to the RAD in Majebi was inadmissible because it could have been presented to the RPD. The length of time that a permanent resident could be outside of Brazil without losing their status, and the passage of this time, were facts known at the time of the RPD hearing in Abel, and no evidence was brought to demonstrate anything new or changed.\n[85] It will be for another case to decide whether proof, beyond the passage of time, that the status expired as anticipated at the time of the RPD hearing would be admissible under s. 110(4) and\/or new as per Singh.\n[86] Having found, as above, that some new evidence must be permitted under the Majebi test, I find that this is such a case due to the unforeseen nature of the change in law. The evidence renders the RPD's conclusion on exclusion erroneous. For this reason, I find that Majebi permits me to revisit the question of exclusion \"de novo.\" I have done so as of today's date.\n[87] This interpretation avoids the strange dichotomy described above, where identical fact scenarios lead to different results. Those whose RPD decision contained an error obtain updated analysis and access to the third prong of Zeng, while those who had the \"misfortune\" of a correct RPD decision do not. If Majebi is interpreted to allow for new evidence to establish the RPD's error, including evidence that post-dates the date of the RPD-hearing, both parties with the identical admissible new evidence would have access to the same analytical framework.\n[88] I also emphasize that Zeng provides us a framework to evaluate when someone may be excluded despite no longer having a status in a 1E country. Concerns about asylum shopping and the voluntary loss of status, as well as the ability to regain a status, are all relevant considerations. Appellants who present evidence that satisfies the criteria of s. 110(4) may still be excluded based upon their actions such as waiting out the clock on a status in a safe third country.\n[89] This is an area of the law which would benefit from more analysis taking into account the facts of particular cases.\nThe Appellants have lost their permanent residency in Ecuador since the RPD hearing\n[90] The Appellants concede that they held permanent resident status in Ecuador - indeed, they still held this status at the time of the RPD hearing on February 7, 2020.\n[91] At the time of the RPD hearing, Ecuadorian law allowed permanent residents (after the first two years) to remain outside the country for up to five years without losing their status.52 The Appellants left Ecuador on XXXX XXXX, 2018;53 their status would have been valid until XXXX 2023. Indeed, on February 18, 2020, the Consulate of Ecuador confirmed that they had not breached the time frames required to keep their residency.54\n[92] After the Appellants perfected their appeal in August 2020, Ecuadorian immigration law changed. As of February 4, 2021, the maximum time that permanent residents can be abroad before risking their status was lowered from five years to two years.55 The text of the law states that a permanent resident, \"after the first two years, may be absent from the country for up to two continuous years; after this time he will lose permanent residence.\"56\n[93] In the Appellants' case, this means that they would have lost their status on XXXX XXXX, 2020 - several months after they perfected their appeal to the RAD.\n[94] In response to my notice of December 17, 2021, the Appellants provided further evidence on this issue. The Principal Appellant wrote to the Consulate of Ecuador and included his passport, his date of departure from Ecuador, and his Ecuadorian identity card. He asked specifically if the change in law affected his status.57 The Consulate responded that it did: since he had been gone from the country for more than three years, the Consulate stated that he had lost his status.58\n[95] I accept this evidence. The Associate Appellant left Ecuador at the same time, and I accept that this applies to her situation as well on a balance of probabilities. The Minister has not intervened to present any evidence to the contrary. A clear statement from consular officials is highly probative. The Appellants have met their onus to demonstrate that, since they left Ecuador, they have lost their status on a balance of probabilities.\nThe facts weigh against exclusion under the Zeng test\n[96] Having concluded that the Appellants have lost their status in Ecuador, I must balance the following factors to decide if they are excluded from refugee protection:59\na. the reason the Appellants lost their permanent residency in Ecuador (voluntary or involuntary);\nb. whether the Appellants can return to Ecuador;\nc. the risk that the Appellants would face in their country of citizenship, Cuba;\nd. Canada's international obligations; and\ne. any other relevant facts.\na) Reason for loss of status\n[97] I find that this is a neutral factor in this case.\n[98] The Appellants are sophisticated. The Principal Appellant is a system engineer who cofounded a company where he was the Development and Technology Manager.60 The Associate Appellant worked at a business in Ecuador that specialized in Canadian immigration services.61 The Appellants both speak Spanish, and obtained work permits in Ecuador before becoming residents. I find that they knew or ought to have known that being outside of the country for an extended period would jeopardize their status.\n[99] This being said, when the Appellants left Ecuador they could have been abroad five years. They would, as of today's date, still have permanent residency in Ecuador. A change in Ecuador's laws reduced the time that they could be abroad by more than half.\n[100] I find that this greatly mitigates any voluntary element to the loss of status in this case. The Appellants argue that the change was unforeseen, and they did not have \"the opportunity to take steps to prevent a loss of status in their country of residence.\" I accept that though the loss at some time after leaving the country was foreseeable, it was not foreseeable that the rules would change in this way.\n[101] For this reason, I find that this is a neutral factor in this case.\nb) Ability to return to Ecuador\n[102] I find that this factor weighs in the Appellants' favour.\ni) No durable status in Ecuador\n[103] As I have detailed above, the Appellants have lost their status in Ecuador. Though the Minister's submissions on this point would have been helpful, there is no evidence before me that there is a process to seek an exemption to the law, or to retain their status. This would be a consideration, and I would have weighed the Appellants' efforts to regain the status. In this case, however, the text of the law is clear that after two years away a permanent residence \"will lose permanent residence\" [emphasis mine].62 The correspondence from the Consulate in Ecuador is specific to the Appellants' case and categorical.63 It does not indicate any process for reapplication.\n[104] On a balance of probabilities, I find that the Appellants cannot return to Ecuador.\n[105] Without status, they risk return to Cuba where, as I will explain, they face a serious possibility of persecution.\nii) Risk in Ecuador is not material to this case\n[106] A separate element of the ability to return to Ecuador is whether the Appellants would be safe there. This could also be considered under other factors, but I will do so here.\n[107] If a refugee claimant faces a risk of persecution or a danger of torture or risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in their country of permanent residence, they will normally not be excluded.64\n[108] The Appellants have argued that they faced discrimination in Ecuador. The RPD determined that the discrimination faced did not rise to the level of persecution. The Appellants challenge this finding on appeal.\n[109] Though I am inclined to find that the RPD was correct in its conclusion, I have not found it necessary to assess the Appellants' arguments on this issue. I have found that the Appellants have no durable status in Ecuador and that they face a serious possibility of persecution in Cuba. If I found that they also faced a risk in Ecuador, this would only strengthen my decision not to exclude them. If, however, I concluded that they were safe in Ecuador, I would not find that this outweighs the risk they face in Cuba or their lack of status in Ecuador. My decision would be the same regardless of whether they also face a risk of harm in Ecuador.\nc) Risk faced in Cuba\n[110] For the following reasons, I accept that the Appellants face a risk of persecution in Cuba.\ni) The Principal Appellant opposes the Cuban government\n[111] The Principal Appellant has a history of voicing opposition to the Cuban government. I accept that he may do so in future, based upon his sincere political beliefs. Here is why.\n[112] He alleges that he first faced some threats for expressing ideas critical of the Cuban state in university and once working after graduation.65\n[113] While living in Ecuador, he XXXX XXXX XXXX \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXviolation of human rights in Cuba.\" The XXXX is XXXX XXXX XXXX, but the Appellants presented some evidence of its content and proof that he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.66 I accept that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[114] The Principal Appellant also submitted copies of some of his activity on Twitter. The tweets range from XXXX-2018 to XXXX 2019,67 and make comments such as \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" and \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX #XXXX #XXXX.\"68 Of particular note, the Principal Appellant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.69\n[115] There are facts that made me consider the issue of credibility carefully. The Appellants returned to Cuba from Ecuador twice to visit family.70 In 2018, they moved back to Cuba because they did not like the discrimination they faced in Ecuador. I considered whether returning to Cuba, where the Appellants say they are in danger, calls the credibility of their allegations into question. I find that, when taken with the totality of the evidence, the trips back to Cuba do not outweigh the clear evidence of the Principal Appellant's opposition to Cuba's political regime.\n[116] The Principal Appellant has not embellished or exaggerated his evidence. He does not claim to have been a high-profile opponent in Cuba. He did not embellish his allegations of being threatened before he first left Cuba. He is clear that he was threatened several times with not being allowed to graduate, with being fired, or with prison - but he is honest that none of these consequences ever came to pass.71 There are no allegations that the Appellants were threatened on their return trips to Cuba. There are no allegations that the Appellants were prevented from leaving Cuba, as sometimes happens to dissidents.\n[117] I also found the evidence about the Appellants' lives in Ecuador to be frank and unexaggerated. For example, the Principal Appellant was clear that though he was the victim of an armed robbery in Ecuador, he could not say that it was an act of discrimination. Though he lived in a primarily Cuban neighbourhood, he did not attempt to embellish or guess at the motives of his attackers.72\n[118] For these reasons, I found the Appellants' evidence to be credible. I note that the RPD, having seen the Appellants testify, also found them credible.73\n[119] I accept that the Principal Appellant sincerely opposes the Cuban government. He has, at times in his past, made his opinion public. He states he will not stop expressing his political opinion: \"my ideals and political opinion will not change, so I will be at risk of facing prison and abuses by the political police and the different repressive mechanisms.\"74\n[120] Having found the Principal Appellant sincere in his political beliefs, I cannot expect him to refrain from ever expressing them. I have considered whether the actions he has taken, such as posting personal opinions on social media, would put him at risk if he returned to Cuba.\nii) The Principal Appellant's political beliefs put him at risk of persecution\n[121] The objective evidence indicates that Cuba has become more repressive, and proactively so, in response to protests that began in 2021.75\n[122] There have been confirmed reports of the government committing arbitrary or unlawful killings and long-term disappearances. The 2021 protests were met with \"systemic and violent repression.\"76 Anyone associated with or close to the protests was in danger of such treatment. There were \"recurring reports that \"human rights and pro-democracy advocates, political dissidents, and peaceful demonstrators\" were harassed, intimidated, and physically assaulted\" with impunity.77\n[123] \"Public reports revealed that the government monitored citizens' internet use and retaliated against them for their speech.\"78 Social media posts, such as those the Principal Appellant has made in the past, have led to targeting.79 Internet usage, including private communications such as emails, are heavily monitored, controlled, and a new law criminalizes online information for various reasons, including being offensive, against general welfare, or respect for public order.80\n[124] A May 2020 law broadened arbitrary arrest powers. Preventative detention, in absence of criminal charges, is permissible for up to four years for \"precriminal dangerousness\" which can be \"demonstrated by conduct in manifest contradiction of socialist norms.\"81 The law is used to target peaceful political opposition, and police \"routinely\" detain, question, search citizens.82\n[125] Legal arrest procedures were often disregarded. Interrogations were reported to use \"physically abusive tactics, threats, and harassment during questioning.\" Detainees were mistreated, threatened, and sometimes physically and sexually assaulted.83 Detainees \"cannot challenge the lawfulness of their detention in court\" and cannot contest the facts alleged against them.84\n[126] There is no evidence before me that the Principal Appellant has voiced his opposition to the Cuban government in any recent public way. However, he cannot be asked to keep his political views silent upon return to Cuba to avoid risk. Though this is not a case of a high-profile activist, the sheer rate of political repression using precriminal detention is staggering. Reports indicate that it is not only those with a high-profile or group affiliation that are targeted; ordinary citizens who have participated in peaceful protest have been sought out for punishment.85\n[127] As a result of the July 11 protests, the number of arbitrary arrests rose steeply, with 5,000 to 8,000 arrests and detentions, according to estimates by the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders. The NGO Justicia 11J estimated 710 remained in detention as of December.86\n[128] Authorities routinely and systematically monitor private communications, conduct arbitrary stops and searches, and search homes without legal authority.87 Surveillance is done through infiltration, informants and neighbourhood groups (Committees for the Defense of the Revolution).88 There is recent evidence that it is not only higher-profile journalists or opponents who have been targeted.89 \"The government closely monitors users who post or access political information online and delivers harsh penalties to those it perceives as dissidents.\"90\nThe authorities also monitor expressions of dissent on social media and through surveillance of electronic communications, punishing users with criminal charges or other forms of reprisal. Decree Law 389, approved in 2019, authorizes investigators to engage in electronic surveillance without prior judicial approval and use the resulting information as evidence in criminal cases.91\n[129] I have found the Principal Appellant credible in his genuine opposition beliefs. He has done so publicly before, including in direct connection with the current president. In Cuba's current context, the Principal Appellant's past political expression and his right to do so in future put him in danger of more than a mere possibility of persecution for his political beliefs.\n[130] As for the Associate Appellant, I find that her association with her husband is sufficient to place her at risk. Reprisals against the family members of targeted individuals are reported.92 Moreover, she is an Afro-Cuban woman. I might not have found that this alone puts her in danger of persecution. The intersections of her identities, however, do heighten the risk that she faces if she is targeted for her husband's political views. Afro-Cubans face disproportionate targeting in police operations, and interactions with police are \"aggravated\" by racial discrimination.93\n[131] Adequate state protection is not available. The Appellants fear the Cuban state and pro-state actors. \"Government officials, at the direction of their superiors, committed most human rights abuses.\" 94 \"Impunity was pervasive,\" and \"there were no known cases of prosecution of government officials for any human rights abuses, including torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\"95\n[132] As a matter of policy, officials failed to investigate or prosecute those who committed these abuses. Impunity for the perpetrators remained widespread, as was impunity for official corruption.\n[133] For this same reason, I do not find that the Appellants have a safe internal flight alternative (IFA) within Cuba. A small country, there is nowhere that the Principal Appellant's political expression would not place him in danger.\n[134] For these reasons, there is more than a mere possibility that both Appellants will face persecution if returned to Cuba.\nd) International obligations and other relevant facts\n[135] I find that Canada's international obligations weigh against exclusion in this case.\n[136] Refugee protection is a form of surrogate protection. Article 1E recognizes that those with status in a safe country do not require it. One element of Article 1E is the prevention of asylum shopping.\nIt precludes the conferral of refugee protection if an individual has surrogate protection in a country where the individual enjoys substantially the same rights and obligations as nationals of that country. Asylum shopping refers to circumstances where an individual seeks protection in one country, from alleged persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual punishment in another country (the home country), while entitled to status in a \"safe\" country (the third country).96\n[137] Staying outside of one's country and allowing a status in a third, safe country to lapse would normally weigh in favour of exclusion. I recognize the importance of the deterrent impact necessary in such cases. In this case, I find the impact is mitigated somewhat by the fact of the lack of warning that the Appellants had of a change that would retrospectively remove their status. I do not find that the Appellants' actions gain an advantage in Canada in a manner inconsistent with the objectives of the IRPA or with the clear reasoning behind Article 1E.\n[138] Because I have found that the Appellants face a risk of persecution in Cuba, Canada's obligations of non-refoulement and the protection of refugees are engaged as well. When I weigh these obligations against the risk of asylum shopping, I find that in this particular case, Canada's international obligations weigh against exclusion.\ne) Weighing of factors\n[139] Considering the factors together, they weigh against exclusion. I have found that though it was foreseeable that the Appellants would lose their status in Ecuador if they remained outside of the country, this was mitigated in this case by an unexpected and retrospective change to which they did not have the opportunity to respond. The Appellants do not currently have status in Ecuador and, on the facts before me, do not have the ability to return there. The most significant factor in my assessment was that of risk in Cuba. My finding that the Appellants face a serious possibility of persecution in Cuba outweighed my hesitation in rewarding the Appellants for having lost their status in Ecuador or the appearance of asylum shopping. As I have said, the facts of this case do not suggest a voluntary or purposeful surrender of status in a manner calling for strong denunciation. For this reason, I did not assess the Appellants' allegations of risk in Ecuador because I found, on the totality of the facts, that it would make no difference. Even without facing a risk in Ecuador, the facts surrounding their loss of status mitigated my concerns such that the risk in Cuba was the most significant factor in my consideration.\n[140] For all of the above reasons, I find that RPD erred in finding that the Appellants were excluded. This error is both that the RPD conducted a risk assessment after having concluded that the Appellants were excluded and, having reviewed the matter in light of the new evidence filed, in its ultimate conclusion on the issue. The Appellants are not excluded from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention.\nThe Appellants are Convention Refugees\n[141] I have addressed above that the Appellants face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Cuba as a political dissident and, for the Associate Appellant, a family member a dissident. There is neither adequate state protection nor an IFA available to them, given that the state is the agent of persecution in this case. For these reasons, I find that the Appellants have a well-founded fear of persecution and that they are Convention refugees as described in s. 96 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[142] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.\n(signed)\nL. Brittain\nLaura Brittain\n21 October 2022\nDate\n1 Majebi v.

He appeals the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (\"RPD\") whereby his claim for refugee protection was denied. The Appellant asks the Refugee Appeal Division (\"RAD\") to set aside the RPD decision and to substitute its own determination that he is a Convention refugee within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (\"IRPA\"). In the alternative, the Appellant asks that the RAD return the matter to the RPD for redetermination.\n[2] The Appellant has tendered new evidence under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. Following perfection of the appeal, the Appellant served further new evidence under rule 29 of the RAD Rules and requested an oral hearing pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.\n[3] The Minister did not intervene at the RPD. Following receipt of the application to submit additional evidence under rule 29 and considering the allegations contained therein,2 pursuant to the Alazar3 decision, the RAD notified both the Minister and the Appellant4 that the allegations raised constituted a claim based upon a new Convention ground, inviting the Minister to respond by way of filing Notice of Intervention. The Minister failed to respond and, as such, does not participate in the matter.\n[4] The oral hearing was held on February 9, 2022, with the Appellant and his counsel present.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA.\nBACKGROUND\n[6] The Appellant is a citizen of Iran who grew up in Baghdad in a Muslim family. He has several siblings, including one brother A.A.5, who is alleged to be an agent of persecution. The Appellant (who was an aspiring musician) moved from Iraq to Jordan in 2014 where he was able to pursue a career in music. As Shia Muslims, his family disapproved of his musical interests causing him to take employment with a family member in the automotive industry. Following his relocation to Jordan, he met a woman who he eventually married. Although his wife was of Iraqi descent, she had obtained Jordanian citizenship via her previous marriage to a citizen of Jordan. The Appellant was introduced to Christianity via his wife who was Christian, though not at that time extremely devout in her worship. Together, the Appellant and his wife became more involved in the Christian faith and were, ultimately, baptized as Christians on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[7] The Appellant's conversion from the Islam faith to Christianity was somehow learned of by his family back in Iraq. In telephone conversations with family members, he was berated, insulted and threatened for this choice. I might add that, in addition to hostility towards his musical career aspirations, his family (excepting a sister) expressed hostility due to his having married a non-Muslim.\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Appellant alleges that he received a telephone call that his mother was very ill and had been hospitalized. He claims that A.A. advised that the Appellant was forgiven by both the brother and the mother and that his mother wanted to see him. He immediately flew to Iraq. He claims that when he deplaned and turned his telephone on, he got a call from his sister (who had remained positive towards and supportive of his life choices) who advised that the mother was not ill and that the whole incident was a ruse perpetrated by A.A. who intended to avenge the family honour by killing him. The Appellant immediately returned to Jordan where his brother called and, on learning that the Appellant was aware of the scheme, announced that it was his duty to kill the Appellant and that many others in the family agreed with him.\n[9] In XXXX 2018, the Appellant was invited to join a group of performers who were coming to Canada to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Following arrival in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, in January 2019, the Appellant claimed refugee protection based upon his religious conversion.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[10] My role is to review the RPD decision on a standard of correctness after having conducted an independent examination of the evidence.6 The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in the assessment and weighing of oral testimony heard which may, in certain cases, allow me to defer to RPD findings. I do not believe the RPD enjoyed any such meaningful advantage in this appeal and all evidence from the RPD hearing has been taken into consideration in arriving at my decision.\nNEW EVIDENCE CONSIDERED\n[11] On appeal, the Appellant submits the following two online articles as new evidence:\n(i) \"When Were Joseph and Mary Married?\" dated September 20, 2013;7\n(ii) \"Were Mary and Joseph Married or Engaged at Jesus' Birth?\" dated December 1, 2020.8\n[12] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA provides that new evidence can only be admitted on appeal if it arose after the RPD rejection of the claim, was not reasonably available at the time of the rejection or could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been presented to the RPD before the rejection. If the proposed new evidence meets one or more of the subsection 110(4) requirements, pursuant to the jurisprudential factors set out by the Raza decision, later modified by the Singh decision,9 I must then determine if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before it can be accepted.\n[13] The Appellant argues that these articles meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA because he could not have anticipated that the marital status of Jesus' parents would form an important (adverse) credibility finding.10 I agree with this submission and, turning then to the Raza and Singh factors, it is evident that the articles bring evidence that is new and relevant to the matter and would appear to emanate from credible sources. Accordingly, I find these articles to be admissible for purpose of the appeal.\nADMISSIBILITY OF RULE 29 EVIDENCE\n[14] Following perfection of his appeal, the Appellant submitted further new evidence pursuant to rule 29 of the RAD Rules. The new evidence featured the Appellant's own affidavit, as well as four exhibits.11 In his affidavit, the Appellant alleges that, after the negative RPD decision but prior to the determination of his appeal, following a period of psychological anguish, he had come to the realization that he identified as a bisexual male which exposed him to further risk of persecution if returned to Iraq. This new evidence has not been considered by the RPD and, in essence, forms a new ground by which the Appellant claims refugee protection.\n[15] The Appellant has provided the following documents as proposed rule 29 evidence:\n(i) the affidavit of the Appellant sworn September 29, 2021;\n(ii) a psychiatric report dated XXXX XXXX, 2021;\n(iii) extensive notes from the Appellant's family physician;\n(iv) a support letter from an organization known as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX) which is active in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (\"LGBTQ\") community; and\n(v) a support letter from an intimate same-sex partner, M.A.\n[16] Rule 29 allows the Appellant to make an application to provide documents which have not been previously provided. An application under rule 29 must include an explanation of how the document meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and how the evidence relates to the Appellant.12 In determining the application, I must consider any relevant factors which includes the relevance and probative value of the documents, any new evidence the documents bring to the matter and whether the Appellant could have, with reasonable effort, provided the document with his Appellant's Record.\n[17] The Appellant submits that the rule 29 evidence:\n(i) concerns events that transpired after XXXX 2021;\n(ii) is relevant and material as it addresses a new ground for fearing persecution;\n(iii) the evidence is corroborated by both medical reports, a statement from and LGBT organization and a member of the public; and\n(iv) the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Iraq corroborates the risk to members of the LGBT community in Iraq.\n[18] All of these documents relate to the issue of a possible new ground by which Convention refugee status might be claimed, namely: the Appellant's sexual orientation. The documents are relevant and probative as they relate both to the Appellant's newfound sexual orientation, as well as the risk to members of the LGBTQ community in Iraq. The evidence is clearly new as it was not before the RPD for consideration. It could not have been provided at the time the appeal was brought as it was only after the appeal had been lodged that the Appellant's sexual orientation manifested itself. I find that this evidence meets the rest set out by rule 29 of the RAD Rules.\n[19] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA allows for the introduction of new evidence in certain circumstances which includes where an appellant could not have reasonably been expected under the circumstances to have presented it prior to the RPD rejection.\n[20] In considering the admissibility of this new evidence, I have taken into account the Chairperson's Guideline 9 (SOGIESC) and, in particular, as it applies to disclosure of sexual orientation.13\n[21] Given the timing of the Appellant's recognition of his sexual orientation and based upon the other factors discussed above, I am satisfied that the new evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. Next, I am required to consider the jurisprudential requirements for new evidence as set out in the Singh decision,14 which requires that the proposed new evidence be credible, relevant and new. Again, based upon the timing of the revelation, I am satisfied that it provides me with evidence that, subject to be tested, appears to be credible - particularly as there is corroboration from the medical field. All of the evidence is capable of proving a new Convention ground as the Appellant claims to be a member of a particular social group, namely: bisexual individuals, and I consider it to be new since, as discussed above, it was not reasonably available for presentation to the RAD at an earlier time.\n[22] Accordingly, I accept this new evidence under rule 29. As set out above, an oral hearing was held pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA at which time the Appellant provided further testimony with respect to the allegations. Prior to reviewing his testimony, I shall briefly set out the substance of the new evidence.\nORAL HEARING CONVENED\n[23] Subsection 110(6) of the IRPA provides that the RAD may conduct an oral hearing in circumstances where new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the Appellant, is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim.15\nANALYSIS OF MERITS OF APPEAL\nAppellant's affidavit\n[24] In his affidavit, the Appellant deposed that he came to realize that he was bisexual in XXXX 2021.16 As a result of this realization, he started to be active on various internet dating applications and eventually met M.A. who he spoke with and ultimately agreed to meet.17 The Appellant and M.A. agreed to be friends only, but this friendship caused the Appellant, in XXXX 2021, to seek out men for sexual encounters.18\n[25] The Appellant further deposed that, based upon his upbringing, these encounters resulted in feelings of guilt which he claims caused him to feel depressed and to attempt suicide on two occasions.19 As discussed in greater detail below, the contents of the affidavit were the subject of an oral hearing before the RAD.\n[26] Turning then, to the exhibits attached to the affidavit which included a letter from a psychiatrist, the notes of the Appellant's family physician, a support letter from the XXXX and a letter of support from M.A.\n[27] The psychiatrist's letter which appears as Exhibit A20 confirms that he was referred to the psychiatrist. The consultation occurred XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, and notes that the Appellant is depressed and had attempted suicide on two previous occasions by overdose. The psychiatrist indicates that the Appellant reports his bisexuality to the doctor advising that he is bisexual, and fears being killed if he goes back to either Jordan or Iraq. A recommendation is made for psychotherapy by a qualified psychologist.\n[28] Exhibit B21 to the Appellant's affidavit is an extensive package of clinical notes prepared by the Appellant's family doctor. The notes date back to a period that well predates the RPD hearing and based upon these notes, it is possible to discern that the family doctor was, as a result of various physical symptoms, questioning whether the Appellant in some form of psychological distress or was under stress. This is a consistent theme throughout the doctor's notes. For example, in XXXX 2020, the Appellant reported that he was very anxious and, though no suicidal ideations were reported, the doctor's notes show that there was at least some concern for self-harm, as he was advised of certain steps to take should such ideations manifest themselves.22\n[29] These signs of psychological stress continued to present following the rejection of the RPD decision. Approximately XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX months after the claim was rejected, the Appellant attended his doctor's office at which time he reported that he was worried about his sexual orientation and that he had engaged in a same-sex encounter.23 This encounter was, according to the doctor's notes, triggering worry about social and family status.24\n[30] The support letter from XXXX is authored by an individual who identifies himself as the \"XXXX XXXX\" and provides little information about the Appellant's situation, other than to say this person was assisting the Appellant with his \"settlement needs\".25\nDuring the oral hearing the Appellant provided credible and compelling testimony as to his newfound sexual orientation\n[31] The purpose of the hearing was to review (and test) the credibility of the Appellant's evidence as set out in his rule 29 application.\n[32] The Appellant delivered his testimony in a spontaneous and straight-forward manner. Despite the sensitive and intensely private nature of the information discussed, he remained composed and provided his evidence in an entirely credible manner. Certain subjects he found difficult to talk about, however, as discussed below with respect to the SOGIESC Guideline, in my view, neither the divergence from the affidavit, nor the difficulty in openly articulating certain topics detracts from the Appellant's credibility.\n[33] The Appellant testified that he met M.A. through the online dating application Tinder and, following initial communications via that application, began to communicate via WhatsApp. Eventually, they agreed to meet at M.A.'s residence where sexual relations occurred. Though their relationship is not exclusive, and the Appellant has been with other men, he and M.A. continue to see each other, and the relationship continues to be sexualized.\n[34] There was one point of divergence between the Appellant's testimony and his affidavit. In his affidavit, he claims that he and M.A. were just friends and that his sexual encounters had been with other men. At the oral hearing, the Appellant went into much greater detail as to the nature of his relationship with M.A. Once again, I found his testimony to be credible, consistent and comprehensive. It is noteworthy that the Appellant is a married individual who comes from countries of reference where SOGIESC activity is marginalized and, indeed, criminalized. Taking into account the Appellant's personal, psychological, cultural and social factors (as the SOGIESC Guideline requires me to do), there can be no adverse inference drawn from the deviation between his testimony and his affidavit.\n[35] Similarly, I am not troubled by the fact that M.A. did not attend the hearing. The Appellant provided an explanation which I accept. Counsel submits that the Appellant's testimony was credible and stands on its own and the fact that M.A. did not attend the hearing was simply a matter of weight with respect to his letter. I accept that argument and, accordingly given the support letter of M.A. little weight.\n[36] As to the weight to be given to the medical reports, I note that in the case of such evidence, all too often, it emanates from the individual, as it is a form of self-report. However, the encounters which form the basis of the claim are of an inherently intimate and private nature and once can scarcely imagine how it could be otherwise. The elements of this fresh allegation that could be proven have been tested by means of the oral hearing. I have had an opportunity to probe the Appellant's allegations and have his evidence to be credible and compelling, and I find that he has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is a member of a particular social group, namely: a bisexual male.\nRisk upon return to Iraq\n[37] The Appellant claims that he is afraid of being killed if returned to Iraq or Jordan. The RPD found that Jordan was not a country of reference for the Appellant.26 As such, my review of the Appellant's risk shall be confined to Iraq.\n[38] The most recent NDP for Iraq27 establishes that the Appellant's concern is well-founded. For example, the following information derives from the NDP:\n(i) while there is no formal legal prohibition against same-sex intimacy, there have been same-sex couples prosecuted on the basis of other criminal provisions such as prostitution and public indecency;28\n(ii) there remains a significant threat of violence against people on the basis of same-sex desire or gender expression;29\n(iii) despite the fact that Iran's civil code is silent on same-sex sexual behaviour, Sharia judges have been known to order executions of men and women for same-sex behaviour;30\n(iv) police and militias have frequently kidnapped, threatened and killed LGBT people;31\n(v) while consensual same-sex sexual acts between adults are not specifically prohibited in Iraq, the Penal Code prohibits sexual relations outside marriage, effectively criminalising all same-sex sexual behaviour as there are no provisions for same-sex marriage;32 and\n(vi) a person living openly as an LGBTI person will be at higher risk of treatment from the state which could amount to persecution or serious harm due to the state's failure to protect LGBTI persons from mistreatment at the hands of state actors, or punish officials for misdemeanours committed against members of the LGBTI community.33\n[39] Referencing, once again the SOGIESC Guideline, the existence of laws that criminalize or suppress non-conforming sexual orientations may be indicative that an individual has a well-founded fear of persecution; being compelled to conceal one's sexual orientation constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights that may amount to persecution and an individual cannot be expected to conceal his sexual orientation as a means of avoiding persecution.34\n[40] Based on the foregoing, I conclude that the Appellant is a Convention refugee who has a well-founded fear of persecution based upon his sexual orientation. Given this finding, it is unnecessary for me to consider the appeal insofar as the original RPD decision is concerned.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nChristopher G.

Gardner\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I dismiss this appeal by the Minister.\n[2] XXXX XXXX (Principal Respondent), XXXX XXXX (adult Associate Respondent) and XXXX XXXX (minor Associate Respondent) are citizens of Gambia. They allege that the Principal Respondent and adult Associate Respondent married against the wishes of the adult Associate Respondent's family since the Principal Respondent is a member of the slave family class in Gambia, while the adult Associate Respondent is a member of a prominent family class.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Respondents were credible witnesses and believed their allegations. The RPD also found that adequate State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the Respondents and that they did not have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Gambia. The Minister (Appellant) argues that the new evidence submitted in the appeal seriously undermines the identities and the credibility of the Respondents as well as the merit of their claim for protection. The Respondents acknowledge that they used the fraudulent documents identified by the Appellant to travel to Canada, but submit that the Appellant is only speculating when stating that the names on those passports are the real names of the Respondents and that the Respondents are likely still in possession of those passports.\n[4] The determinative issue in the appeal is credibility.\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Respondents are Convention refugees.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] Both the Appellant and the Respondents are relying on new evidence in the appeal.\nThe Appellant's evidence is accepted\n[7] According to the Law,1 I may accept documentary evidence from the Appellant. The Federal Court of Appeal has held2 that before I can accept any evidence in an appeal, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant (the Singh\/Raza factors).\nUnited States of America (USA) Biometric Report3\n[8] This report, dated April 14, 2021, indicates that the fingerprints of the Principal Respondent returned matches for XXXX XXXX, travelling to the USA on a Gambian passport. I find that the report is credible and relevant, and it is new in the sense that it presents previously unknown travel by the Principal Respondent to the USA. I accept the report into evidence.\nIntegrated Customs Enforcement System (ICES) Statutory Declaration4\n[9] This declaration, dated April 16, 2021, shows the entries into Canada for XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXXusing Gambian passports andXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX using a Mozambique passport. I find the report credible and relevant, and it is new in that it identifies the passports used by the Respondents to enter Canada. I accept the declaration into evidence.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Results - Statutory Declaration5\n[10] This report, dated April 16, 2021, shows that XXXX XXXX entered the USA on a Gambian passport on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. I find the report credible and relevant, and it is new in the sense that it tends to refute the Principal Respondent's narrative. I accept the declaration into evidence.\nGlobal Case Management System (GCMS) Applications for Canadian Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) for XXXX XXXX6, XXXX XXXX7 andXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX8\n[11] These documents show the records concerning the application for the visas the Respondents used to enter Canada. I find that the documents are credible and relevant and new in the sense that they provide additional detail on how the Respondents entered Canada. I accept the documents into evidence.\nGCMS Canadian Visitor Record (VR) for XXXX XXXX9\n[12] This document records the visit to Canada by XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. I find the report is credible and relevant and new in the sense that it tends to refute the Principal Respondent's narrative. I accept the document into evidence.\nSome of the Respondents' evidence is accepted\n[13] According to the Law10, I may accept documentary evidence from the Respondents in response to evidence from the Appellant.\nAffidavit of Principal Respondent11\n[14] This affidavit explains some of the omissions and inconsistencies brought to light by the Appellant's evidence in the appeal. Although affidavits from persons who are the subject of the appeal do not usually meet the tests for new evidence, in this case the affidavit does as it is in response to new evidence submitted in the appeal. Turning to the Singh\/Raza factors, the affidavit was sworn in Canada and therefore presumed to be credible, it is clearly relevant to the appeal, and it is new in the sense that it tends to refute some of the Appellant's submissions. I accept the affidavit into evidence.\nTIN Number Document12\n[15] The Respondents submit that this document was issued by Gambian authorities to the Principal Respondent and is required to open a bank account or obtain a passport, among other things. I find that the document is credible, relevant and new in the sense that it tends to refute the Appellant's submissions. I accept the document into evidence.\nBirth Certificates of XXXX XXXX XXXX13 and XXXX XXXX XXXX14\n[16] The Respondents submit that these certificates are those of the Principal Respondent's nieces and show the Principal Respondent's true family name. While I have no reason to doubt the credibility of the certificates, there is nothing before me that ties the Principal Respondent to the persons named on the certificates. The Principal Respondent's Basis of Claim (BOC) form15 lists three brothers named XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and one sister named XXXX XXXX, none of whom are listed as a parent on either birth certificate. Although both the Principal Respondent's affidavit and the Respondent's memorandum both refer to nieces of the Principal Respondent, both certificates indicate that the sex of the person is \"M\", which I infer to indicate meaning male. I find that the Respondents have not demonstrated that the certificates are relevant in the appeal. I do not accept the certificates into evidence.\nNational ID card of XXXX XXXX16\n[17] The Respondents submit that this card is that of the Principal Respondent's father. While I have no reason to doubt the credibility of the card, the name on the card is XXXX XXXX with a birthdate of XXXX XXXX, 1946. The Principal Respondent's BOC form17 originally listed the Principal Respondent's father at XXXX XXXX with a birthdate of XXXX XXXX, 1946. At some point, the \"XXXX\" was struck out and replaced with a handwritten \"XXXX\". Although the Principal Respondent states that \"h\" and \"k\" are used interchangeably in Gambia, there is no explanation for the different first names or the different birthdates. I find that the Respondents have failed to demonstrate that the card is relevant to the appeal, and I do not accept it into evidence.\nAffidavit of XXXX XXXX18\n[18] The affiant is an articling student of the Respondents' counsel and is solely used to introduce new evidence in the appeal. I find that the affidavit is credible, relevant and new and I accept it into evidence.\nToronto Star article19\n[19] This article describes a case where a genuine Gambian passport was obtained using fraudulent documents. The Respondent's argue that the article shows that fraudulent Gambian passports are readily available.\n[20] I find that the article is credible and relevant. It is also new in the sense that it tends to refute one of the Appellant's arguments. I accept the article into evidence.\nThe Gambia: ID cards, passports and birth registration20\n[21] This document is already before me as part of the National Documentation Package for Gambia.\nORAL HEARING\n[22] The Respondents have requested that I hold an oral hearing. Subsection 110(6) of IRPA gives me the discretion to hold an oral hearing if new evidence has been accepted that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Respondents, that is central to the decision with respect to the Respondents' claims and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the Respondents' claims.\n[23] I find that the new evidence accepted in the appeal does raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Respondents, is central to the decision with respect to the Respondent's claims and does justify allowing or rejecting the Respondents' claims. Accordingly, I held an oral hearing on November 30, 2021, with both the Appellant and the Respondents participating. The oral hearing was limited to the following issues:\n* the genuineness of the identity documents presented by the Respondents to the RPD;\n* the genuineness of the identity documents presented by the Appellant in the appeal;\n* explanations by the Respondents for the various identity documents;\n* the impact of this evidence on the Respondents' credibility; and,\n* any other issue raised by statements made by the Respondents during the hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[24] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.21\nIdentity\n[25] At the RPD, the Principal Respondent and adult Associate Respondent presented birth22 and marriage23 certificates, and Gambian national ID cards24, to establish their identities and a birth registration25 to establish the identity of the minor Associate Respondent.\n[26] The Appellant submits that the Respondents used their genuine passports to enter Canada and are more likely than not still in possession of those passports. The Respondents submit that they have never had passports in their own names and travelled to Canada on false passports procured by an agent and these passports were kept by the agent once the Respondents had entered Canada.\n[27] I am not persuaded by the Appellant's submissions. The Respondents do not dispute that they entered Canada on the passports introduced into evidence by the Appellant. The Appellant submits the passports used by the Respondents would have contained security features which would have been examined by Canadian border officials and that it is more likely than not that the passports presented were their genuine valid passports. However, the objective documentary evidence26 is that bribery is very common among the lower levels of government and that all forms of vital statistics are entered by hand in records that are archived locally in analogue form. The same evidence goes on to state that foreign citizens have been able to obtain Gambian passports containing fraudulent information. The new evidence from the Respondents also confirms that fraudulent documents are readily available in Gambia. From this, I infer that a competent agent would also therefore be able to obtain \"genuine\" Gambian passports with false names. In order to obtain visas for Canada and the USA, the agent would have also needed to prepare a background story, hence the other documents provided by the Appellant in the appeal and the various stamps in the passports.\n[28] The Respondents' descriptions of how they entered Canada are plausible and were consistent between their Basis of Clam (BOC) narratives and their testimony. The Appellant has not adduced any evidence that the Gambian national ID cards presented by the Respondents are not genuine. Those ID cards use the names the Respondents used before the RPD and continue to use here. Similarly, the Appellant has not provided any evidence to support the opinion that the Respondents are still in possession of the passports they used to enter Canada.\n[29] I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondents have established that they entered Canada using false passports provided by an agent and that the identities of the Principal Respondent and adult Associate Respondent are as indicated on their Gambian national ID cards and the minor Associate Appellant's identity is established by her birth registration.\nCredibility\n[30] In 2018, a Federal Court decision27 laid out the relevant principles in analyzing credibility in the context of refugee claims:\n* Refugee applicants are presumed to tell the truth, but this is a presumption rebuttable by the applicant's lack of credibility, e.g. where the evidence is inconsistent with sworn testimony or where the applicant's explanation for the inconsistencies is not satisfactory;\n* Even though they may be insufficient when taken individually or in isolation, the accumulation of contradictions, inconsistencies and omissions regarding crucial elements of a refugee claim can support a negative conclusion about an applicant's credibility;\n* A negative credibility finding cannot be based on minor contradictions that are secondary or peripheral to the refugee protection claim;\n* A lack of credibility concerning central elements of a refugee protection claim can extend and trickle down to other elements of the claim and be generalized to all of the documentary evidence presented to corroborate a version of the facts;\n* Credibility findings should not be made based strictly on the absence of corroborative evidence. Where corroborative evidence should reasonably be available to establish an essential element of a claim and there is no reasonable explanation for its absence, a decision-maker can draw a negative inference of credibility based on the claimant's lack of effort to obtain such corroborative evidence; and\n* Conclusions can be drawn concerning an applicant's credibility based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality.\n[31] The RPD found that the Principal Respondent and adult Associate Respondent were credible witnesses. The Appellant argues that the new evidence presented in the appeal show omissions and inconsistencies in the Principal Respondent's evidence that undermine his credibility to the extent that the presumption of truth28 of his sworn evidence has been rebutted. The Respondents argue that they have provided satisfactory explanations for the omissions and inconsistencies and that the presumption of truth remains.\n[32] I have independently assessed the evidence, testimony and considered the arguments of the Appellant and Respondents. While there are unexplained omissions in the Respondents' evidence, I agree with the RPD's overall conclusion that the Principal Respondent is credible for the reasons that follow.\nFailure of Principal Respondent to seek protection in the USA in 2016\n[33] The Appellant argues that the failure of the Principal Respondent to seek protection in the USA in 2016 undermines the Principal Respondent's credibility. The Respondents argue that the explanation for not seeking protection in the USA in 2016 was reasonable.\n[34] I agree with the Respondents. There is nothing implausible regarding the Principal Respondent's 2016 trip to the USA. According to his narrative, the Principal Respondent travelled to the USA to see if it would be safe for him and his family. After making inquiries with the Gambian community in the Bronx, he discovered that members of his wife's family were present there. I find that it was reasonable for the Principal Appellant to conclude that he and his family would not be safe in the USA and therefore not seek protection there.\nOmission of Principal Respondent's 2017 visit to Canada\n[35] The Appellant argues that the omission of any mention of the Principal Respondent visiting Canada in 2017 until challenged in the appeal undermines his credibility. The Respondents argue that the failure to mention the visit was an oversight.\n[36] The Appellant's argument has merit. The evidence, which is undisputed, is that Principal Respondent travelled to Canada using a Gambian passport in the name of XXXX XXXX, arriving from Ethiopia on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, and departing for the USA on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. The Principal Respondent's BOC narrative makes no mention of a visit to Canada in 2017, nor was there any mention of the trip at the RPD hearing. While it is true that using false passports or other illegal means to escape persecution cannot be held against them, once claimants are in Canada, illegal acts or failure to be completely truthful can impugn a claimant's credibility.\n[37] Turning to the omission itself, with respect, not including the visit was not a simple oversight. To enter Canada in 2017, the Principal Respondent used a false passport obtained by an agent. The Principal Respondent's BOC narrative29, at paragraphs 18-26, details his interactions with the agent. In XXXX 2016, the agent suggested Canada as a safe country for the Respondents. The Principal Respondent then states that after agreeing on a price of $XXXX US, he worked very hard and saved everything they could for almost 18 months. It does not make sense that the Principal Respondent would not mention in his BOC narrative that he had taken time off work and pay to travel to Canada just to make sure Canada would be a safe place for him and his family. I find that the Principal Respondent has not satisfactorily explained why he failed to mention his 2017 visit to Canada, and I draw a negative inference from the omission and lack of explanation.\nOmission of Principal Respondent's 2017 return to USA to work\n[38] The Appellant argues that the omission, until challenged in the appeal, of the Principal Respondent returning to the USA in 2017 after his visit to Canada and working in the USA undermines his credibility. The Respondents argue that the failure to mention the visit was an oversight.\n[39] The Appellant's argument has merit. The evidence, which is undisputed, is that Principal Respondent departed for the USA on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, and worked in XXXX in the USA until leaving in XXXX 2018. The Principal Respondent's BOC narrative makes no mention of a visit to the USA or working there in 2017, nor was there any mention of this at the RPD hearing.\n[40] To enter the USA in 2017, the Principal Respondent used a false passport obtained by an agent. The Principal Respondent's BOC narrative states that during the relevant time period, the Principal Respondent is working very hard and saving everything to obtain the money to pay the agent. However, living and working in the USA for a number of months is not a simple oversight. The Respondents' Generic Application Form for Canada30 and Schedule A Form31 both state that Respondents lived in Mozambique from XXXX 2014 to XXXX 2018.\n[41] I find that the Principal Respondent has not satisfactorily explained why he failed to mention his 2017 travel to the USA or his working there, and I draw a negative inference from the omission and lack of explanation.\nPrincipal Respondent's reavailment to Mozambique\n[42] The Appellant argues that the Principal Respondent's reavailment in 2017 following his trip to Canada and the USA brings his subjective fear into question and undermines the credibility of the claim. The Respondents argue that it was understandable why the Principal Respondent would return to Mozambique.\n[43] The Respondent's argument has merit. The Principal Appellant had travelled alone to Canada and the USA in 2017 while his wife and daughter remained in Mozambique. Once he had determined that Canada was safe and had raised some money in the USA, I find that it was reasonable for the Principal Appellant to return to Mozambique so that they could leave together and claim for protection as a family in Canada.\nExtensive travel history in Principal Appellant's passport\n[44] The Appellant argues that the extensive travel history of the Principal Respondent in 2013 and 2014, as evidenced in his passport, contradicts the narrative that the Respondents could not afford to apply for asylum in Mozambique in 2014. The Respondents argue that he did not do any of that travel and that those stamps were put there by the agent who obtained the passport.\n[45] I am not persuaded by the Appellant's argument. At the hearing, when asked about this other travel, the Principal Appellant testified that he did not do any of that travel and that the agent had put those stamps there to show that the Principal Appellant had moved around. Travel history is a consideration by officials on whether to issue a visa, as it shows whether a person is likely to return to their home country. I find the Respondents' explanation for the stamps in the passport to be reasonable.\nConclusion on credibility\n[46] Although I am not satisfied with the Respondents' explanations for the omissions of the 2017 visits to Canada and the USA, I find that these omissions are not sufficient to fatally impugn the Principal Respondent's credibility. I therefore find that the presumption of truth of the Respondents' sworn evidence and testimony has not been rebutted. I therefore find that the core allegations of the claim have been established.\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[47] The RPD found that state protection would not be available for the Respondents and that no viable internal flight alternative (IFA) exists for them in Gambia. The Appellant has not made any arguments regarding these findings.\n[48] I have reviewed the record and agree with the RPD assessment of state protection and IFA for the Respondents. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondents would not receive state protection and do not have a viable IFA in Gambia.\nCONCLUSION\n[49] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Respondents are Convention refugees.\n(signed)\n\"Charles A.

She claims that she faces persecution there because of her sexual orientation, as she identifies as a lesbian. She claims that she was threatened, beaten and extorted by members of the Mungiki gang on the basis of her sexual orientation, and that when she reported the crime to the police, they too threatened her with prosecution for her sexual orientation. She is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), which found that she had not credibly established her allegations because her testimony about her alleged same-sex relationships was vague and evasive; she failed to provide expected corroboration of her alleged relationship; she provided inconsistent evidence about the alleged attack; and she provided a letter from her uncle, XXXX, that was not genuine. It found that her other supportive evidence was insufficient to overcome these credibility concerns. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its determination. She argues that her evidence was not vague; she had provided a reasonable explanation for why she did not provide Facebook messages from her alleged same-sex partner; and that the RPD did not consider that cultural factors and her mental health might have made it difficult for her to testify about her same-sex relationships. Further, she argues that the RPD failed to give sufficient weight to her supportive documentation, such as an affidavit from her alleged same-sex partner in Kenya. Based on my review of the evidence and arguments, I find that the RPD did not err in its credibility findings, agree that there are significant credibility concerns arising from the Appellant's evidence, and agree that she has not established that she is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal and uphold the RPD's decision that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant claims that she is at risk because of her sexual orientation. She claims that she identifies as lesbian, but that she had to conceal her sexual orientation in Kenya because of her conservative family and the homophobic context and laws against same-sex relationships there. She claims that, in July 2018, she began a same sex relationship with a woman named XXXX who she met at the market where she worked. She claims that they kept their relationship secret, but that they would see each other about four times a week. On May 2, 2019, she claims that she was confronted by men who were members of the Mungiki gang, who assaulted and threatened to kill her because of her sexual orientation and demanded that she pay them 300,000 Kenyan shillings. She reported this attack to the police, but claims that they refused to assist her, and further that they told her that they had a file on her and threatened to follow up with her about her alleged sexual orientation. She claims that she left her home and went to stay with her uncle XXXX, but then two men claiming to be part of the Mungiki gang came to look for her there while she was out. She then fled to stay with a friend, XXXX, who connected her with an agent who would assist her to travel to Canada, which she did in XXXX 2019. She made a refugee claim here in January 2020.\n[4] Her claim was heard by the RPD on March 29, 2021. In its reasons dated April 8, 2021, the RPD rejected the Appellant's claim. It found that her allegations lacked credibility, as it found that her testimony about her alleged same-sex relationships was vague and unresponsive; there were inconsistencies in her evidence about the alleged attack by the Mungiki gang; that a letter purporting to be from her uncle XXXX was inauthentic; and that her other supporting evidence was insufficient to overcome these credibility concerns.\n[5] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its credibility findings. She argues that her evidence about her same sex relationships was not vague, and that there were cultural and psychological reasons that may have impacted her ability to provide detailed evidence about these relationships. She argues that she explains a lack of corroboration of her relationship and communications with XXXX and that the RPD should have considered her supporting documentation, in particular an affidavit from her alleged same-sex partner XXXX. She did not challenge the RPD's findings about the inconsistencies in her evidence of the alleged attack by the Mungiki gang or that the letter from her uncle XXXX was not genuine. She does not provide new evidence or request an oral hearing of her appeal.\nANALYSIS\nRole of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD)\n[6] As held by the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica,1 the RAD must review RPD decisions on a correctness standard with respect to questions of law and findings of fact (and mixed fact and law), which raise no issue of the credibility of oral evidence. Deference may be required when the RPD is in an advantageous position with respect to the assessment of oral evidence.2 In this case, I have reviewed the RPD's decision on a correctness standard, as I find that the RPD was not in an advantageous position regarding the assessment of the Appellant's oral evidence, as I was able to review and clearly understand the recording of the hearing.\nInconsistencies in the Appellant's evidence regarding the alleged attack by the Mungiki gang diminishes the credibility of her allegations and her credibility in general\n[7] The RPD found that the Appellant's evidence regarding the alleged attack by the Mungiki gang in May 2019 to be inconsistent, and that this reduced the credibility of these allegations. Based on my review, I agree with these findings.\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellant was inconsistent regarding the number of men who allegedly attacked her. In her Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative, she stated that four men attacked her, but in her testimony, she stated that it was two men. When confronted with this inconsistency, the Appellant denied that she had said that there were two men. The RPD rejected this explanation and made a negative inference from this significant inconsistency.\n[9] The Appellant does not challenge this finding. Based on my review, I agree with the RPD's finding that the Appellant was inconsistent in her evidence regarding the number of men who attacked her, and that this was a significant inconsistency which reduced the credibility of her allegations. In her BOC narrative she stated that four men attacked her,3 but in her testimony she stated that two men attacked her, and when the RPD asked her to confirm her account, she repeated again that it was two men who had attacked her. When asked if she could explain this inconsistency, the Appellant denied that she had stated that there were two men and said, \"I said four.\" Based on my review of the recording of the hearing, I find that the Appellant had in fact testified twice that it was two men who had attacked her,4 and I reject her denial that she had consistently said that there were four men. I find that the Appellant's evidence regarding this central incident in her claim was inconsistent, that this was a significant inconsistency, and that this seriously diminished the credibility of her allegations.\n[10] The RPD also found that the Appellant was inconsistent regarding whether or not she had received injuries from the attack. In her testimony, it found that she stated that she had no injuries, but later said that she was unconscious but had not received any treatment. A psychological assessment stated, however, that she was bleeding from the attack, had broken teeth but no head injury, and that she ended up in the hospital for treatment of her injuries. When confronted with these inconsistencies, the Appellant stated that she had mixed up the incident with another occasion in May 2017 when she was attacked by criminals. The RPD rejected this explanation because the report clearly states that these injuries were linked to the alleged attack by the Mungiki gang.\n[11] The Appellant does not challenge this finding and based on my review I agree with the RPD that her evidence regarding injuries was inconsistent, and find that these inconsistencies were significant and central, and that they diminish the Appellant's credibility. Based on my review, I find that the Appellant initially testified that she was not injured in the attack and that the gang members just scared and warned her, but later stated that she was knocked unconscious in the attack. She also testified that she had not received any medical attention.5 I find that this is inconsistent from the account in her psychotherapy assessment, which states that she was beaten, bleeding, suffered broken teeth, and that she was treated in the hospital.6 I find that these accounts are insistent, and that the Appellant's explanation that she mixed up the attack by the Mungiki with another assault by criminals in 20177 to lack credibility, as this attack was omitted from her BOC narrative. Further, the inconsistency about the number of men who attacked her was repeated both in her testimony and in the account provided in the psychotherapy report. I agree with the RPD that these inconsistencies are damaging to the Appellant's credibility.\nThe letter purporting to be from the Appellant's uncle XXXX was not genuine\n[12] The RPD found that a letter from the Appellant's uncle XXXX was not genuine. It noted that the date of birth listed on the back of the identity card provided with the letter stated that he had been born in 1988, which was not consistent with the date of birth listed on the front of the card, which stated that his date of birth was 1958. The Appellant could not provide an explanation for this inconsistency. The RPD found as a result that the letter was not genuine and made a negative influence regarding the Appellant's credibility.\n[13] The Appellant does not challenge this finding, and I see no basis to find that the RPD erred in it. During the hearing the Appellant could not explain the inconsistency in the date of birth listed,8 and through her counsel conceded that the date of birth was inconsistent on the back of the card but submitted that it might be the result of a typographical error. Based on my review, I agree with the RPD that there is an inconsistency in the date of birth listed on the card,9 that this was unexplained, and that this undermines the credibility of the purported letter from the Appellant's uncle XXXX.\nThe Appellant's evidence regarding her same sex relationships was vague and lacking in detail and expected corroboration\n[14] The RPD found that the Appellant's evidence regarding her alleged same sex relationships was vague and lacking in detail, and that this reduced the credibility of her alleged relationships. It found that her evidence regarding her first relationship with XXXX was vague and that she could not provide details such as XXXX last name. It found that her evidence regarding her relationship with XXXX was also vague and evasive. Even though they had dated for more than a year and the Appellant claims that she saw XXXX four times a week, it found that she could not provide specific information about XXXX or their relationship, and that her answers were generic and vague.\n[15] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in these findings. She submits that the RPD failed to consider the Chairperson's SOGIESC Guideline, and in particular her cultural context and upbringing in a conservative family, which made it difficult for her to discuss her same-sex relationships. Further, she argues that her XXXX XXXX discusses a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that the RPD erred in failing to consider the impact of her mental health on her ability to testify. Finally, she argues that her evidence about her relationships with XXXX and XXXX was not vague. Her relationship with XXXX was short and that is why she was unable to provide many details; and she did answer the panel's questions and gave details about her relationship with XXXX such as details of their dates and how their relationship progressed.\n[16] Based on my review I find that the RPD did not err in its analysis of her evidence of her alleged same-sex relationships, and that her evidence was vague and lacking in detail, which reduced its credibility. I find that she was unable to give almost any information about her alleged first relationship with XXXX. In fact, when asked the name of her first same sex partner, I note that the Appellant paused before providing the name of XXXX and was unable to provide her last name. She was vague when asked how old she was when she started the relationship, first stating only that she was a \"youth\", and then when asked again by the RPD, said that she was 20 years old. This was the extent of the details provided about her relationship with XXXX. When asked to tell the panel about her, she only stated that she was just a friend.10\n[17] Similarly, I find that her evidence regarding her relationship with XXXX was also quite sparse and lacking in expected detail. When asked to talk about her next relationship, I note that the Appellant did not answer the question directly and just talked about how she had to hide her sexual orientation. When the RPD followed up, she stated that she was in a relationship with XXXX for three years. When asked to describe her, she just said that XXXX was the woman she loved, she was obedient, and that she had the same sexual orientation. When asked XXXX age, I find that there was again a long pause before she provided an answer of \"45.\"11 When asked to talk about XXXX, she said that she worked in a XXXX, that she loved her, and again that she was \"obedient.\" She stated she liked the person that she is, she was hardworking, and she liked the feeling that she had for her.12 When asked if XXXX had any hobbies or interests, she again paused and stated that XXXX had hopes for their relationship and loved her job. I find that the Appellant's answers about her relationship with XXXX, which was a central part of her claim, were vague and unresponsive, and that this diminished her credibility.\n[18] The Appellant argues that cultural factors may have impeded her ability to testify about her same-sex relationships. I consider the Appellant's cultural context, which she describes as coming from a conservative family and from Kenya, where homophobic laws and attitudes were present. I note that Chairperson's Guideline 9 reminds members to consider whether cultural or psychological barriers may explain testimony about same-sex relationships that is vague and lacking in detail. In the Appellant's case, however, I find that the questions asked by the panel were not particularly sensitive or intimate in nature, but rather related to basic personal information such as her alleged first same-sex partner's last name, or XXXX hobbies or what she liked about her. I find that the Appellant has not established that cultural factors explain her inability to provide such details, and that the lack of these details diminishes the credibility of her alleged same-sex relationships.\n[19] The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred in failing to consider her mental health in making its credibility findings, and that it failed to address her psychological evidence in its reasons. She cites her psychotherapy assessment, which states that she is experiencing symptoms of adjustment disorder and argues that the RPD erred in failing to consider her mental health in its credibility assessment.\n[20] While I agree that the RPD did not specifically address the psychotherapy assessment in its reasons, I find that this was not fatal to its overall determination, as I find that the Appellant has not established on a balance of probabilities that her vague testimony about her same sex relationships was explained by her mental health. I consider her psychotherapy assessment, but give it limited weight, because it was based only on a one-time assessment by a psychotherapist, who is not the Appellant's treating therapist. Further, the Report states that the Appellant was \"fully-oriented,\" \"alert,\" showed no abnormality in her thought processes and \"her thought content was clear,\"13 which diminishes her claim that mental health symptoms affected her ability to provide details about her claimed relationships. While the assessment identified that she experienced \"severe\" scores on testing scales such as the Beck Depression Index, I note that such scales are brief and based on the Appellant's self-report. There was no accompanying report from her treating medical doctor who was named as the person who diagnosed her adjustment disorder. During her hearing, I find that the Appellant did not demonstrate an inability to understand the questions posed, and there was no request for any specific accommodation of her mental health condition or any request to have her deemed a vulnerable person under the Board's procedures. I find that the Appellant has not established on a balance of probabilities that her mental health condition explained her inability to provide details about her alleged same-sex relationships.\n[21] The RPD further found that the Appellant did not provide expected corroboration of her relationships with XXXX such as copies of their Facebook messages, which she claimed they used in order to keep in touch with each other on a regular basis. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in this finding, as she had explained the lack of corroboration, explaining that she did not provide these messages in her claim because their messages were not \"love messages,\" as she did not want to put XXXX at risk if such messages were to be found by the Mungiki gang or the authorities. Further, she argues that XXXX did provide an affidavit to corroborate their relationship.\n[22] Based on my review, I find that the RPD did not err. I find that corroboration of the Appellant's contact with XXXX and their relationship, which the Appellant claims was on-going, would reasonably be expected, even if the messages were not \"love messages.\" The failure to provide corroboration can be considered when there are valid reasons to doubt the claimant's credibility,14 or where the explanation for failing to provide this evidence when it would reasonably be expected is not accepted.15 Here there are credibility concerns that make it appropriate to consider a lack of corroboration of the Appellant's allegations. Further, I find that evidence such as some corroboration of the Appellant's claimed ongoing communication with XXXX would reasonably be expected. I find that the RPD did not err in considering the lack of corroboration of her communications with XXXX.\n[23] As noted by the Appellant, she did provide an affidavit by XXXX as corroboration of their claimed relationship. I find, however, that this affidavit does not overcome the significant and central credibility concerns identified above. While the document from XXXX does corroborate their relationship, I find that it is very terse and provides very little detail about this relationship. Further, as noted by the RPD, it does not appear to be properly sworn, as the name of the commissioner or notary is not legible.16 I disagree with the Appellant's argument that the RPD erred in its assessment of her documentary evidence, in particular the affidavit from XXXX.\n[24] The Appellant also provided an affidavit from her friend XXXX, whom she allegedly stayed with after she fled from her uncle XXXX home. I agree with the RPD that this document is not properly sworn, as it has not been witnessed by a notary or commissioner,17 and give it limited weight. Finally, as discussed above, I agree with the RPD's finding that the letter purporting to be from the Appellant's uncle XXXX lacks credibility. I find that the RPD did not err in its assessment of the Appellant's documentary evidence, and that this evidence is insufficient to overcome my other significant credibility concerns, as discussed above.\n[25] In summary, based on these findings, I determine that the credibility of the Appellant's allegations and her credibility in general are seriously diminished, and that she has not established her allegations on a balance of probabilities.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] On the basis of the findings outlined above, I dismiss the appeal. I find that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nCynthia Pay\nCynthia Pay\nJanuary 10, 2022\nDate\n1 M.C.I. v. Huruglica (F.C.A., no.

The Appellant also fears the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), a criminal gang, because he worked with a youth group, at his Catholic Church, which was responsible for helping youth with drug addiction and gang recruitment.\n[3] The Appellant left Guatemala and came to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019. He made a claim for refugee protection in XXXX 2020.\n[4] The RPD heard his claim for refugee protection on March 30, 2021. On April 30, 2021, the RPD denied his claim for refugee protection on the basis that he had an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Guatemala.\nRole of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD)\n[5] The RAD conducts its own analysis of the record to decide whether or not the RPD's decision was wrong. The RAD generally does not owe any deference except in rare cases where the RPD held a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony. The standard applied on this appeal is one of correctness.1\nDECISION\n[6] Pursuant to section 111(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),2 the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Appellant is a Convention3 refugee.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\n[7] The Appellant has not submitted new evidence and is not requesting that an oral hearing be held. Since no evidence has been submitted, an oral hearing will not be held.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellant is a member of Kaqchkel tribe which is part of the Mayan Indigenous population. The RPD found that the Appellant, on occasion, suffered discrimination in Guatemala because of his ethnicity. However, the RPD found that the Appellant failed to establish that this discrimination cumulatively amounts to persecution as the discrimination experienced by the Appellant was not sustained or a systemic violation of his human rights. The RPD reasoned that the Appellant did not establish that he has been unable to access housing, work, or other services in Guatemala or that he would be unable to do so in the future based on his ethnicity.\n[9] The RPD found that the Appellant was at risk from unidentified individuals affiliated with the mining company. The Appellant's uncle was a leader of their indigenous people, and he was vocal about the treatment of the indigenous communities and indigenous land being taken over by mining companies. His uncle was killed in XXXX 2019. After his uncle's death, the Appellant took on his uncle's responsibilities. Shortly after taking on the role, the Appellant was attacked. He then left Guatemala.\n[10] The RPD also accepted that the Appellant was beaten by MS-13 for his religious outreach but found that the MS-13 are not pursing the Appellant.\n[11] Nonetheless, the RPD found that the Appellant had an IFA in Guatemala in the cities of Solola; Santa Cruz del Quiche; and Retalhuleu.\n[12] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred by failing to consider whether the discrimination faced by the Appellant cumulatively amounted to persecution and failed to consider the totality of the evidence and his circumstances. The Appellant also submits that the RPD erred in its IFA assessment.\n[13] I find that the RPD erred in finding that the cumulative discrimination faced by the Appellant did not amount to persecution for reasons which follow. Given this finding, I will not assess whether the RPD erred in its assessment that the Appellant has viable IFA in various cities in Guatemala as result of his fears from unidentified persons affiliated with the mining company or from MS-13.\nWhether discrimination, based on ethinicity, amounts to persecution\n[14] In Ward, the Supreme Court of Canada defined persecution as acts which are sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.4\n[15] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has published a book titled \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\" (the \"Handbook\").5 The Handbook provides guidance on what constitutes discrimination at paragraphs 54 and 55 as follows:\n(c ) Discrimination\n54. Differences in the treatment of various groups do indeed exist to a greater or lesser extent in many societies. Persons who receive less favourable treatment as a result of such differences are not necessarily victims of persecution. It is only in certain circumstances that discrimination will amount to persecution. This would be so if measures of discrimination lead to consequences of a substantially prejuidical nature for the person concerned, e.g. serious restriction on his right to earn his livelihood, his right to practise his religion, or his access to normally available educational facilities.\n55. Where measures of discrimination are, in themselves, not a serious character, they may nevertheless give rise to a reasonable fear of persecution if they produce, in the mind of the person concerned, a feeling of apprehension and insecurity as regards to his future existence. Whether or not such measures of discrimination in themselves amount to persecution must be determined in light of all the circumstances. A claim to fear of persecution will of course be stronger where a person has been the victim of a number of discriminatory measures and where there is thus a cumulative element involved.\n[16] The jurisprudence has recognized that cumulative harassment or discrimination can amount to persecution in certain circumstances.6\n[17] I find that the RPD narrowly focused on few experiences of the Appellant and accepted that these acts were discriminatory but found that these were insufficient to establish that he faced discrimination amounting to persecution. I find that the RPD erred as the RPD failed to appreciate the totality of the Appellant's experiences and evidence. For the reasons which follow, I find that the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant does not face cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution.\n[18] The Appellant made an asylum claim in the United States (U.S.) on XXXX XXXX, 2018.7 On XXXX XXXX, 2019, a credible fear interview was conducted by the U.S. authorities. During this interview, he stated that he was part of a group, in his church, which tried to rehabilitate youth from alcohol and drug abuse. He stated that in XXXX 2018, four individuals beat him and told him they would kill him because he was involved in the church rehabilitation group. He was told by these four individuals that they didn't like him because he was indigenous and because of the colour of his skin.8 He stated that he did not report the incident of being beaten by the four individuals to the police because indigenous people do not get help from the non-indigenous community and that the police would have not done anything due to police corruption.9\n[19] Also, during his interview, the Appellant stated that people call them \"Indian\" and he did not know why people treat them like that.10 He also stated that indigenous people are told that they do not deserve to live there because their language and culture are different. He stated that people call indigenous people dirty including names like \"dirty Indians.\"11 He stated that indigenous people are denied opportunities to work, and they are not allowed to live in their homes.12\n[20] The RPD did not assess any of the evidence regarding the discrimination described by the Appellant in his interview with the U.S. authorities in reaching a conclusion that the discrimination faced by the Appellant did not amount to persecution.\n[21] On XXXX XXXX, 2019, the Appellant was interviewed by the Canada Border Services Agency.13 During this interview, the Appellant stated that indigenous people face discrimination in Guatemala. He stated he returned to Guatemala from the U.S. on XXXX XXXX, 2019, because his uncle had been killed. He stated that when he started looking into his uncle's death, three men grabbed him and tortured him, and he was informed that if he continued to look into his uncle's death, he too would be killed. He stated because of the torture, he has scars on his hands and has limited vision in his right eye.\n[22] On XXXX XXXX, 2020, he was again interviewed by the Canada Border Services Agency.14 During this interview, the Appellant stated his fear is related to him being an indigenous person and because his uncle was killed. The Appellant explained that he was his uncle's right-hand man. His stated that his uncle was killed because he would assist indigenous persons recover land, owned by indigenous communities, from mining companies.\n[23] At the RPD hearing, the Appellant testified that 10 years ago his mother had fractured her leg and went to the hospital, but she did not receive any treatment. Instead, she had to find a bonesetter to help her. He testified that when he was attacked by MS -13 in 2018, he did not report the attack to the police or go to the hospital to treat his injuries because he would face discrimination at both the police station and at the hospital because of his ethnicity. At the RPD hearing, he also described a situation when he went to Guatemala City. He testified that he felt that he was looked down upon by others in Guatemala City and a bus did not stop for him at a bus stop. He believed these incidents were related to his ethnicity.\n[24] After conducting my own independent assessment of the evidence, I find that the Appellant described, credibly, a number of discriminatory incidents in Guatemala including discrimination in health care, verbal abuse, physical attacks, and lack of protection from Guatemalan authorities.\n[25] I find that the Appellant's claims of discrimination are also supported by the country condition evidence. A report titled, \"Guatemala. The Indigenous World 2021,\" notes that indigenous people continue to lag behind in Guatemalan society, as a whole, in terms of healthcare, education, employment and income due to structural racism which lies at the root of the inequality and social exclusion, as well as violations of fundamental rights of Indigenous people.15\n[26] The United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur issued a report, dated August 10, 2018, on the rights of Indigenous People in Guatemala.16 The report notes that there is institutional discrimination in public expenditures for indigenous people noting that only 10 percent of the indigenous people receive social security.17 The report states that the majority of the indigenous population does not have access to primary health care.18 With respect to education, the report notes that indigenous children continue to have very restricted access to education and that half of indigenous children do not go to school.19 The Special Rapporteur notes that the situation of the Maya, which includes the Appellant's tribe, Xinka and Garifuna peoples is characterized by serious structural problems, particularly the lack of protection for their rights to their lands, territories and resources and racial discrimination that pervades all areas of life.20 The Special Rapporteur expressed deep concern at the resurgence of violence, forced evictions and the criminalization of indigenous peoples that defend their rights.21 Regarding access to justice, the report notes that indigenous people continue to experience serious difficulty, against a backdrop of extreme impunity, in obtaining access to the ordinary justice system in a way that meets relevant international standards.22\n[27] According the BTI 2020 Country Report on Guatemala there have been few serious efforts to implement social policies that would protect the rural, predominantly indigenous, populations.23 The report notes that police reform has been blocked, leading to further corruption with the government.24 The report also states that the indigenous majority remains politically and economically excluded to a large extent.25\n[28] According to UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum - Seekers from Guatemala, impunity is reported to be particularly acute problem in relation to violence and other crimes committed against a range of sectors including indigenous populations.26 The same report states the indigenous population faces high level of exclusion, inequality, discrimination and poverty.27\n[29] Based on the country evidence and the Appellant's own experiences, I find that the Appellant has experienced discrimination because of his ethnicity. The Appellant experienced discrimination in health care; and he was subject to verbal abuse and physical assaults because of ethnicity. I find the various incidents of discrimination and violence described by the Appellant cumulatively amount to persecution. Therefore, there is a serious possibility of persecution based on his ethnicity which has a nexus to the Convention ground of race.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[30] There is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens, except in situations where there is a complete breakdown.28 The burden of proof that rests on claimants increases with the level of democracy of the state in question. State protection does not have to be perfect as no state can guarantee perfect protection. Instead, the test for state protection is whether the protection is adequate at the operational level. Guatemala is a democratic country. Although, universal suffrage is ensured, elections are marked by episodes of political violence, especially at the municipal level, and fraught with illegal financing.29 The last national elections - presidential and parliamentary - in September 2015 were minimally free and fair.30 In Guatemala, civil rights are formally guaranteed but are violated in practice, with the indigenous population often the victim of such abuse.31\n[31] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection would not be available to the Appellant in Guatemala. Based on the objective country condition evidence, I find even if the Appellant made efforts to seek protection from state authorities, his efforts would be futile. The discrimination faced by the indigenous population pervades all areas of life including accessing the police and the justice system. Therefore, I find that the Appellant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[32] To determine that a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) exists, I must first be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the Appellant being persecuted, or personally subjected to risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture in the part of the country where the IFA exists and secondly, that the conditions in the location considered to be an IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the Appellant to seek refuge there. Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellant has an IFA.32 The burden of proof is on the Appellant.\n[33] I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Guatemala since discrimination faced by the indigenous poplulation persists throughout the country. Based on the aforementioned objective country condition evidence, the discriminatory practices including inaccessibility to health care, employment, education, police and the justice system, I find that the cumulative impact of these discriminatory practices are persecutory. Therefore, I find that the Appellant, based on his ethnicity, would face a serious possibility of persecution33 throughout Guatemala. Since the Appellant only needs to establish one of the prongs of the two-prong test, which the Appellant has, I will not determine whether the IFA is objectively reasonable.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Pursuant to section 111(1)(b) of the IRPA,34 the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.

He claims that, in XXXX 2018, his friend suggested that the CAG might help him with the XXXX he was suffering from (caused by the demolition of his property). He claims that he joined the friend's underground church in XXXX 2018 and that, in XXXX 2018, he was interrogated by the Public Security Bureau (PSB),1 who advised him that he had been seen on CCTV distributing religious leaflets. He was made to pay a fine. He claims that, in XXXX 2018, he resumed attending services and that, in XXXX 2018, he was again interrogated by the PSB and issued a warning letter. He claims that the PSB officers told him that they planned to investigate further and, if they discovered that he had been involved in CAG activities, he would be jailed.\n[3] The Appellant decided to contact a smuggler, who helped him obtain a Canadian visa. He left China on XXXX XXXX, 2019, leaving behind his wife and two minor children. He claims that, on XXXX XXXX, 2019, the PSB left a summons for him at his home in China. He signed his BOC form on April 4, 2019.\n[4] For the reasons that follow, I deny this appeal.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE\n[5] The determinative issue is credibility.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[6] In my review of the RPD's decision, I will apply a standard of correctness.2 This is not a case where the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage in making its findings.3\nANALYSIS\nRPD's findings\n[7] The RPD found the Appellant had the following credibility problems:\na) The story the Appellant gave to Canadian officials at the port of entry (POE) regarding when he interacted with the PSB (he said he was interrogated in XXXX and XXXX 2018) was different from the story he gave in his Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative (where he said he was interrogated in XXXX and XXXX 2018)-and both were different from his testimony (that he was interrogated in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX 2018). The RPD rejected as unreasonable his explanations that: i) he forgot to mention the XXXX interrogation at the POE interview and ii) he did not mention the XXXX interrogation in his BOC because he was not detained by the PSB at that time.\nb) His knowledge of the CAG was not commensurate with the length of time he claimed to have practised the faith (in China for some six months and in Canada for over two years, i.e., from XXXX 2019 until his May 5, 2021 hearing), even having regard to his having only nine years of education. In particular, it relied on the fact that: i) he was unable to testify about the content of the flyers he distributed in China or Canada (stating only that the word of God came out of the living flesh); ii) he testified that he had obtained his religious knowledge from the Bible-a book CAG adherents consider obsolete-instead of the CAG's main religious text, The Word Appears in the Flesh; and iii) his answer about what happens to non-believers at the time of the second coming of Christ was inconsistent with the what the country condition evidence states adherents to CAG are taught to believe.\nc) The documents the Appellant submitted in support of his claim, which were said to be from the PSB, were not authentic and warranted no weight, given: i) its credibility findings; ii) his access to forged documents (as evidenced by his ability to enter Canada using a fraudulent Taiwanese passport); iii) and the ready availability of fraudulent documents in China.\nd) The documents the Appellant submitted in support of his religious practice in Canada-a letter from his church and photographs of him engaging in church-related activities-warranted little weight because they are not probative regarding the genuineness of his faith.\n[8] In addition, it rejected the Appellant's sur place claim on the basis that he had not shown that the Chinese authorities were aware of his practice in Canada.\nAppellant's arguments\n[9] The Appellant argues that the RPD's credibility findings were in error.\na) The Appellant concedes that his XXXX 2018 interrogation was \"an important detail\" that he should have included in his BOC narrative; however, he argues that since his detention was corroborated by credible documentary evidence-i.e., a PSB admonition and a receipt for the payment of a fine-the incident in XXXX 2018 was corroborated. It is not a situation where he made an allegation at his hearing that he had not previously made.\nb) The Federal Court has imposed a \"very low bar\" on the ability of refuge claimants to demonstrate their religious beliefs and has called only for his belief to be sincere and not objectively valid. He argues that the RPD was microscopic in finding that he erred in testifying about what happens to those who do not believe in the second coming of Christ. After all, his testimony-that such people were unable to get close to mankind, could not be judged, and could not be close to the kingdom-is entirely consistent with the belief as per CAG doctrine that says that unbelievers may be punished in this lifetime and are bound for hell in the next. In addition, he argues the RPD erred by impugning the genuineness of his faith due to his testimony that he gained knowledge from the Bible because: i) he connected God with the \"living flesh\" in his testimony, thereby invoking the title of the CAG's main religious text The Word Appears in the Flesh and ii) he considers The Word Appears in the Flesh to be his bible.\nc) The RPD's assessment of the documents was erroneous because Ren4 provides that the Board is not permitted to question the authenticity of a document without subjecting it to some independent analysis. He argues that this error provides a basis for the RAD's intervention because the documents, if found genuine, constitute prima facie proof of his claim.\n[10] The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred by rejecting his sur place claim, including the letter from the leader of the church he attends in Canada. This, he argues, is tantamount to saying \"I do not believe you, therefore I do not believe anything explains why I might be wrong.\"5\nMy findings\nCredibility\n[11] I find as follows:\na) It is uncontroversial that the Appellant's interactions with the PSB are at the very heart of his claim and should have been included in his BOC form and narrative. The fact that he omitted the XXXX 2018 interaction with the PSB in his BOC form and narrative leads me to doubt his credibility and to doubt whether that interaction really took place-absent a reasonable explanation.6 I agree with the RPD that his explanations at the hearing, which he does not repeat at appeal, are unreasonable for the reasons the RPD has given. His argument at appeal-that the RPD erred in finding that he \"was not credible because he omitted to mention in his BOC narrative or at the Port of Entry that he was interrogated by the PSB again in XXXX 2018\" because it was corroborated by his supporting evidence-is puzzling. He did mention the XXXX 2018 interrogation in his BOC narrative,7 and the RPD makes this clear. Its point, as discussed above, was that he failed to mention the XXXX 2018 incident about which he testified in either document. I fail to see how the existence of a receipt for payment of a fine dated XXXX XXXX, 20188 or an admonition dated XXXX XXXX, 20189 explain why he failed to include the XXXX 2018 incident in his BOC or in his POE interview.\nb) I agree with the Appellant that the Federal Court has set a low bar when it comes to determining the genuineness of a claimant's faith. It has made clear that the Board ought not to adopt an unrealistically high or overly subjective standard, focus on microscopic errors, or assess the correctness of a claimant's beliefs. However, the Court has also made clear that, \"[i]n cases of religious persecution, the RPD is required to assess whether the person is actually an adherent of the named religion and in doing so, the member is entitled to ask questions about the basic tenets of that religion.\"10 In the instant case, I do not agree that the RPD's questioning was microscopic. It asked open-ended questions with a view to eliciting information about the Appellant's beliefs. I find that his testimony about what happens to people who do not believe in the second coming of Christ (they are unable to get close to mankind, could not be judged, and could not be close to the kingdom) clearly does not corresponded with CAG doctrine as outlined by the RPD. Second, someone who was a genuine CAG practitioner would, I find, know of its basic text, The Word Appears in the Flesh. That the Appellant made general references to \"the living flesh\" does not offset the fact that he testified that the Bible was the source of his learning about the faith. Finally, I see nothing in the evidence to indicate that the Appellant considers The Word Appears in the Flesh to be his bible.\nc) I agree with the Appellant that where the Board questions the authenticity of a document, it must subject the document to independent analysis. I also find that the RPD erred by relying on its previous credibility findings when assessing the supporting documents.11 In my re-analysis of the documents, I note that I have no basis to find that they are fraudulent. This does not mean that I am in a position to find that they are genuine; I am not equipped to undertake a forensic analysis of various documents from various parts of the world. I will weigh the documents against the Appellant's credibility problems in my overall credibility assessment, in order to determine if his claim is genuine.\nd) In addition, I find that the Appellant's supporting evidence in relation to his religious activities in Canada is of little probative value as regards the genuineness of his faith.12 While the author of the letter is in a position to report on the religious activities of the Appellant, he is not in a position to know why the Appellant is participating. Given that a claimant could very easily attend services in Canada with a view to advancing a fraudulent refugee claim, the value of the letter is limited.\n[12] When I consider the Appellant's credibility problems alongside the documents he has provided, I find that he is, overall, lacking in credibility. I find that he was not a genuine practitioner of CAG in China, was not pursued by the PSB, and does not face a serious possibility of persecution or a likelihood of other harm on that basis.\nSur place claim\n[13] The Appellant's invocation of Sterling13-a Mr. Justice Phelan's finding that the RPD was unreasonable not to consider a psychologist's opinion as regards the reasons for the claimant's defective memory in arriving at its credibility finding-is of no assistance to the Appellant.\n[14] I agree that the Appellant's sur place claim is unfounded because there is no evidence that the Chinese authorities are aware of his religious practice here in Canada.\nCONCLUSION\n[15] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, I confirm the decision of the RPD. The appeal is denied.\n(signed)\nJames Sloan\nJames Sloan\nJanuary 3, 2022\nDate\n1 As discussed below, the Appellant's statements regarding when he was interrogated by the PSB were inconsistent.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

She alleges that she fears persecution in Iran because she has converted to Christianity.\n[2] The Appellant travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and made a claim for refugee protection on February 27, 2020. Her claim was heard before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on June 8, 2021, and rejected on June 25, 2021, on credibility grounds. The RPD further found that the Appellant did not establish a sur place claim on the basis of her religious activities in Canada.\n[3] The Appellant appeals to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), arguing that the RPD erred in its credibility analysis and erred in finding that she had not established a sur place claim for protection.\n[4] Following my independent review and analysis of the record, I find that the RPD correctly assessed the Appellant's claim and I agree that she has failed to credibly establish her allegations of forward-facing risk in Iran.\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe evidence presented by the Appellant is accepted\n[6] According to subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), I can only accept evidence that arose after the RPD decision, that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision, or that could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to be brought to the RPD before the decision. Further, according to jurisprudence, I must also find that the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.1\n[7] The Appellant has submitted a letter from her pastor in Canada, outlining her ongoing attendance at church since the date of the RPD decision. The letter provides new information that is relevant to the Appellant's allegation that she is a Christian convert. It is on church letterhead and is prima facie credible. I find it is admissible as new evidence.\nNo oral hearing will be held\n[8] The Appellant has not requested an oral hearing. Subsection 110(6) of the IRPA provides that the RAD may hold an oral hearing if new evidence is accepted that raises a serious credibility issue with respect to the Appellant, is central to the decision with respect to the refugee claim, and if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim. As the new evidence that was admitted does not meet these criteria, the RAD will proceed without an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[9] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellant is not a credible witness and has failed to present sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish her allegations\nThere are material omissions in the Appellant's narrative\n[10] The Appellant alleged in her Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative that she began attending Christian meetings in Iran and later decided to leave the country after hearing about the arrests and surveillance of other Christian converts in her city. However, at the RPD hearing, she testified that the Christian meetings that she had attended had been cancelled after members of her own Christian group were surveilled and apprehended. The RPD asked the Appellant why she did not include this information in her BOC, and she was unable to explain the discrepancy. The RPD drew an adverse credibility inference, finding that she had presented two significantly different versions of the events that caused her to leave Iran, and had failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy in her evidence.\n[11] The Appellant does not dispute this finding. I agree with the RPD, for the reasons it gave,3 that this is a significant and material omission which undermines the Appellant's credibility and the credibility of her allegations about the events in Iran that caused her to flee, and I draw an adverse inference.\n[12] The RPD further noted that the Appellant testified that the Iranian security forces have contacted her family members in Iran looking for her on two or three occasions after XXXX 2020, which was also not mentioned in her BOC narrative. The Appellant was not able to explain this omission. The RPD drew a further adverse inference, finding the omitted information to be material to her core allegations that the security forces are looking for her in Iran in connection with her Christian activities.\n[13] The Appellant argues on appeal that the RPD erred in drawing an adverse inference because these alleged contacts occurred after the initial BOC was submitted, and submits that there is no obligation to provide a \"rolling narrative\" in which each significant event that occurs after the original BOC is signed must be recorded in an amendment. She further cites jurisprudence that supports the reasonableness of an expectation that she could testify about recent events without having to amend her written documents,4 and other jurisprudence establishing that the addition of details that do not change the story but simply add more detail to the information on the record does not support an adverse inference.5\n[14] I do not accept the Appellant's arguments. I find that the allegation that the Iranian authorities have an ongoing interest in the Appellant and have pursued her on multiple occasions cannot be characterized as simply adding more details to information already in the BOC. Further, I note that the Appellant was asked at the outset of the hearing if the information in her BOC was true, complete, and correct, and she indicated that it was.6 If she expected that she would be able to provide an update in testimony at the hearing, then it is reasonable to expect that she would indicate that when asked, rather than affirming that her BOC was complete.\n[15] I note that the Claimant's Guide,7 which is provided to all claimants, clearly addresses this issue as follows:\nCan I make changes to my BOC Form?\nYes. If you find a mistake on your BOC Form or realize that you forgot something important, or receive additional information, you must tell the RPD. Make sure to underline the information you changed or added, sign and date the changed pages, and send the original and one copy of all the pages that have been changed to the RPD. You must also provide a declaration stating that the information in the BOC Form together with the changes and additions is complete, true and correct and that you understand that the declaration has the same force as an oath. The RPD will then forward a copy of those changed pages to the IRCC or the CBSA (whichever sent your claim to the RPD). The RPD must receive the new pages at least 10 days before your hearing [emphasis added].\n[16] I further note that the Appellant was represented by counsel for her RPD proceedings, who can be reasonably expected to explain the process and assist her in preparing her case and submitting any necessary amendments.\n[17] For those reasons, as well as those provided by the RPD,8 I agree with the RPD that this is a material and significant omission which was not reasonably explained. I find that this omission undermines the Appellant's credibility and the credibility of her allegation that the Iranian authorities have an ongoing interest in her based on her Christian activities in Iran, and I draw an adverse inference.\nThere is a lack of corroborative evidence which should be reasonably available, the absence of which has not been reasonably explained\n[18] I find that the above credibility concerns establish a requirement for corroborative evidence to establish these allegations.\n[19] The RPD noted that the Appellant alleged that she is still in touch with one of her friends who attended the Christian meetings with her in Iran, and that the friend received a summons to appear in court in connection with her religious activities. The RPD inquired as to whether the Appellant had considered seeking corroborative evidence from the friend, and the Appellant replied that she did try but was unable to obtain any because the friend was having surgery.\n[20] The RPD did not find this to be a reasonable explanation, noting that the Appellant had over a year from the time that she commenced her claim to the hearing to obtain such evidence, and further, that the Appellant testified to having been in contact with the friend a few days before the hearing and could have obtained evidence from her electronically, such as a text message or email to assist her in corroborating her allegations.\n[21] The RPD further noted that the Appellant had testified that she is regularly in touch with her husband and mother, who were alleged to have had interactions with the Iranian authorities who were looking for her, and who had first-hand knowledge of the circumstances of the summons that was allegedly issued against her. The RPD asked the Appellant why she did not obtain corroborative evidence from her mother or husband to support her allegations, and she responded, \"I don't know, I didn't know anything about these cases.\"\n[22] The RPD noted that the Appellant was represented by counsel and that she did provide other documentary evidence in support of her claim. The RPD found that the absence of corroborative evidence from the friend, mother and husband was not reasonably explained, and drew an adverse inference.\n[23] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in expecting this corroborative evidence, as corroborative evidence is only required where there are significant credibility concerns, and in the present case the RPD erred in the majority of its findings, such that there were not \"significant\" concerns remaining which triggered a need for corroboration.\n[24] I reject this argument. As outlined above, I find that there are significant credibility concerns with the Appellant's allegations in respect of the events in Iran, and I find that these establish a need for corroborative evidence to establish the underlying allegations. I agree with the RPD, for the reasons it gave,9 that there was corroborative evidence that could be reasonably expected to be available to the Appellant, and that after being given an opportunity to do so, she failed to provide a reasonable explanation for not obtaining it.\n[25] I thus draw an adverse inference based on the Appellant's failure to provide corroborative evidence from her friend, mother and husband, which undermines the credibility of the underlying allegations, and undermines her credibility overall.\nThe summons which was provided as corroborative evidence is not reliable\n[26] The Appellant did provide a copy of a summons alleged to have been issued against her by the Iranian authorities, requiring her to report for court proceedings on accusations of apostacy, conversion from Islam and cooperation with groups promoting non-Islamic religions in Iran.10\n[27] The summons was not mentioned in the Appellant's narrative. She alleged in testimony11 that the summons was brought to her family home in Iran in XXXX 2020 by Iranian security agents and shown to her mother, but they did not leave a copy. She alleged that her husband later found a person in Iran who could provide him with a copy of the summons \"unlawfully,\" and that this is how she obtained the copy that was provided for the hearing. She was unable to name the person who allegedly provided the copy of the summons to her husband, but testified that the last she knew, the person was working for the government. As note above, she did not provide corroborative evidence from her husband to establish the circumstances of obtaining the copy of the summons, nor did she provide a reasonable explanation for failing to provide such evidence after being given an opportunity to explain.\n[28] The RPD noted that the objective evidence12 indicates that a copy of a summons will be left with a family member if the subject of the summons is not home. The Appellant indicated that her mother asked for a copy and was refused. As noted above, she did not provide any corroborative evidence from her mother to establish the circumstances of the summons delivery, nor did she provide a reasonable explanation for the absence of such evidence.\n[29] The RPD further noted that the portion of the summons document related to the delivery of the summons was blank. The Appellant could not explain why it was blank and not properly completed by the delivery agent.\n[30] The RPD noted that the objective evidence indicates that failure to appear pursuant to a summons will result in a sentence being issued in absentia. The panel questioned whether the Appellant was aware of any judgment or sentence being issued, and she responded that she did not receive any verdict, but she knew that the verdict for others was death. The RPD questioned whether the Appellant had asked her family members in Iran to check if she had been convicted or sentenced, and she responded that she had not, because she knew what her conviction would be. She further testified that her friend who had been summoned for her participation in the same religious meetings as the Appellant had told her that others had received a verdict of death. As noted above, the Appellant did not provide any corroborative evidence from her friend, nor any reasonable explanation for her failure to do so, after being given an opportunity to explain.\n[31] The RPD further noted that the objective evidence indicates that an arrest warrant will be issued against individuals who do not appear for their summons, and asked the Appellant if she had received a warrant. She responded that no warrants are issued for conversion cases, but did not provide objective evidence to establish this fact.\n[32] The RPD found that there were a number of factors that weighed against the credibility of the summons, including the irregularities in how the Appellant's family was notified of the summons, the fact that part of the summons document was not filled out, the fact that the copy of the document was obtained from an unknown person in an \"unlawful\" way, and the fact that no arrest warrant or sentence was issued after the Appellant failed to appear. The RPD noted that the objective evidence indicates that it is relatively easy to forge court documents in Iran. In consideration of all of these issues, the RPD gave the summons no weight.\n[33] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of the summons. She relies on the same objective evidence cited by the RPD,13 and argues that the evidence establishes that there is no single procedure followed by the Iranian authorities with respect to summons. She submits that the objective evidence is not clear enough to support an inference that her testimony about the delivery of the summons was not credible. She further submits that there is objective evidence that arrest warrants are not always issued in cases involving politics or national security, which is enough to establish that one might not have been issued in her situation.\n[34] The Appellant further argues that the RPD erred in drawing an adverse inference because part of the summons was not filled out, noting that the objective evidence indicates that these documents are delivered by an agent who is like a \"mail man\" from the court, which hardly suggests that the person is a competent professional; further, the objective evidence establishes that there is no standard for issued summons, with some sent by text, others handwritten and others typed; thus, she argues that the objective evidence does not support an adverse inference based on the form being incomplete.\n[35] The Appellant further submits that notwithstanding that her husband obtained the copy of the summons document unlawfully, there is no evidence to establish that it is a forgery. She argues that it could just as easily have been a genuine document obtained by irregular means, as she suggested. She submits that the prevalence of forged documents in a country is not a basis for concluding that a particular document has been forged, as the prevalence of forgery is only relevant if there are other grounds to doubt the genuineness of the document.\n[36] Having reviewed the objective evidence referenced by the RPD and the Appellant carefully, I find that the RPD was correct to find that the summons is not a reliable document.\n[37] Notwithstanding that in some cases, summons are sent by electronic means or arrests are made in the absence of summons, in this case, a summons document was alleged to have been issued and brought to the Appellant's family home. The fact that some arrests are carried out in the absence of a summons does not establish that the established procedures for the issuance and delivery of summons would not be followed in cases that do involve a summons.\n[38] The objective evidence is clear that when a process server delivers a summons to an accused, and the person is not present to be served, a copy will be left with a family member, or if nobody was home, the summons would be put on the door. If the address is unknown, there are alternate service methods available, such as publishing a notice in the newspaper.14 These procedures are consistent with the purpose of the summons, which is to order a person's appearance at a particular place on a particular date and time. It is not clear what purpose a refusal to leave a copy of the summons would serve, as the summoned individual would then not know where or when to appear for their proceedings. I thus find that the alleged circumstances of the summons delivery is not credible.\n[39] Moreover, I find that the simplified description of the delivery agent in the objective country conditions evidence as a process server who is a \"mail man from the judiciary who delivers court papers\" does not serve to undermine the competency or professionalism of the individuals in this role or establish a likelihood that they would not follow established procedures or properly carry out their duties. I note that the report cited in the objective evidence relied on by the Appellant indicates that the process servers are \"judiciary officers\" who are appointed to carry out court summons and serve court orders.15 Further, while the objective evidence establishes that summons may be issued in various formats, the document presented is clearly incomplete in the area that should be completed by the delivery agent, notwithstanding the allegation that it was served on the Appellant's mother, which causes me concern as to the document's authenticity and reliability.\n[40] I further note that the summons document presented indicates that in case of non-appearance \"the sentence will be issued in absentia\" [emphasis added]. The objective evidence indicates that judgments are served in writing and that the person involved will receive a copy of the judgment, and if the judgment is issued in absentia or the accused is abroad when the judgment is issued, it will be communicated to their family.16 I find that in this case, the lack of a verdict or judgment is not consistent with what could be reasonably expected in consideration of the evidence in the record, which casts further doubt on the credibility and authenticity of the summons provided.\n[41] In view of these concerns, and in consideration that the objective evidence indicates that it is relatively easy to forge court documents in Iran and that the summons document presented by the Appellant came from an unknown source and was obtained in an \"unlawful\" manner, I find that the summons document is not reliable evidence, and I give it no weight.\nThere is a material inconsistency in the Appellant's testimony about her church attendance in Canada\n[42] The Appellant testified before the RPD that she began attending church in Canada in XXXX 2020. The RPD pointed out that her BOC narrative alleges that she began attending church in Canada in XXXX 2019 and asked her to explain the discrepancy. She responded that she attended the church for the first time in XXXX 2019, and that she became a Christian and a member of the church in XXXX 2020.\n[43] The RPD found that her testimony about her attendance at church is material to her core allegations of risk on the basis of her Christian identity, and found that the inconsistency between her testimony and narrative was not reasonably explained, noting that she clearly stated in her BOC that she began attending church on Sundays in XXXX 2019, and there was no indication in the BOC that she became a member or began regularly attending in XXXX 2020. The panel drew an adverse inference.\n[44] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in drawing an adverse inference, as this was not a true contradiction but rather an innocent misunderstanding. She submits that she meant to express in her testimony that she physically went to the church for the first time in XXXX 2019, but truly attended for the first time as a member of the congregation in XXXX 2020.\n[45] I find this is still inconsistent with the Appellant's statement in her BOC narrative that \"in XXXX 2019, I started attending church on Sundays,\"17 which suggests that she began regular attendance as of that date, contrary to her testimony at the hearing. The RPD is correct that the narrative makes no mention of regular attendance or church membership beginning in XXXX 2020. Given that the Appellant signed her BOC on February 27, 2020,18 it is reasonable to expect any material events or change of circumstances that occurred in XXXX 2020 to have been included.\n[46] The Appellant further submits that the date that she first attended church is not of great significance to her claim, such that this inconsistency would justify a negative credibility finding, citing Zhang.19\n[47] I find that the present case, in which the Appellant provided contradictory statements about when she started attending church in Canada, is distinguishable from Zhang, in which the Federal Court considered whether the claimant's date of baptism was a material and significant fact that should have been included in his Personal Information Form (PIF), an earlier version of the BOC form that is presently used in the refugee claim process.\n[48] In Zhang, the claimant had declared his baptism in his PIF and later submitted an amendment that added the date of the baptism. The RPD drew an adverse inference based on his failure to include the date in the initial PIF, and the Court found this was an error as the claimant had disclosed the baptism, and found that the precise date of the baptism was not central to his claim.\n[49] In the present case, the Appellant's attendance at church is material to the allegation of her Christian conversion and its genuineness. The Appellant declared in her BOC that she started attending church on Sundays in XXXX 2019, but declared in her testimony that she started attending church in XXXX 2020. It is not a matter of an omission of a peripheral detail, as in Zhang, but rather that she has made inconsistent statements about events and circumstances that are material to her core allegations that have not been reasonably explained, and therefore undermine her credibility.\n[50] I find that the RPD correctly found that the Appellant has not reasonably explained her inconsistent statements about when she began attending church in Canada, I find that the inconsistency is significant and material to the allegations at the core of her claim for protection, and I draw an adverse inference.\nThe Appellant's knowledge of Christianity does not overcome the credibility issues\n[51] The RPD noted that the Appellant provided some limited knowledge of Christianity in her testimony; however, the panel found that her knowledge was not sufficient to overcome the credibility concerns and was insufficient to establish the genuineness of her religious beliefs in view of those concerns.\n[52] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by mischaracterizing her knowledge as \"basic\" and \"limited,\" as she coherently and fluently answered all questions that were posed to her by the panel. She submits that the RPD erred in finding that her knowledge did not establish the genuineness of her religious beliefs.\n[53] I find that the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellant's knowledge of Christianity was insufficient to establish the genuineness of her beliefs, in the circumstances where her credibility has been undermined by numerous adverse credibility findings.\n[54] It is established in jurisprudence that the genuineness of religious beliefs is not to be assessed by way of testing knowledge of religious \"trivia\"; at the same time, the panel is entitled to assess and \"consider whether the claimant holds a level of religious knowledge that would be expected of someone in the claimant's position.\"20\n[55] In my view, the religious knowledge demonstrated by the Appellant in testimony was consistent with what could be expected from someone with her alleged religious profile. However, that knowledge could also have been acquired for the purpose of supporting her refugee claim. In the circumstances where there are numerous serious credibility issues identified in her evidence and testimony, I find that her knowledge of Christianity is not persuasive evidence of the genuineness of her alleged religious beliefs. Rather, I find that it is a neutral factor that neither weighs against nor in favour of the genuineness of her beliefs.\nThe corroborative evidence of religious activities in Canada is insufficient to establish the genuineness of the Appellant's conversion or beliefs\n[56] The RPD also considered the corroborative evidence of the Appellant's religious activities in Canada, including a letter from her pastor corroborating her baptism and attendance at church, a baptism certificate and photos of the baptism, and screenshots of Christian Whatsapp groups of which she is member.\n[57] The RPD found that these documents establish her baptism and religious activities, but not the genuineness of her beliefs, in view of the significant credibility concerns with the Appellant and her allegations. The RPD further noted that the pastor's letter indicated that the Appellant \"was\" attending church, while the Appellant testified that she still attends church regularly.\n[58] The Appellant argues on appeal that the RPD erred by faulting the pastor for his grammar and notes that he referred to her attendance at church before the pandemic caused the services to be delivered online. She relies on her new evidence from the pastor, which confirms her ongoing participation in online services.\n[59] I find that the Appellant has presented credible evidence of her participation in church services before and after the RPD decision and that she has established that she was baptized, however, I find that the evidence of the Appellant's participation in religious activities in Canada has low weight in terms of establishing the genuineness of her beliefs. In view of the credibility concerns in this claim, this evidence is insufficient to establish that the Appellant has undertaken these activities on the basis of genuine Christian beliefs, rather than for the purpose of supporting her refugee claim.\nThe Appellant is generally lacking in credibility and has failed to establish her allegations\n[60] On the basis of my findings above that there are a number of significant credibility issues in the Appellant's evidence, and given that she has failed to present corroborative evidence that should be reasonably available and has not reasonably explained her failure to present such evidence, I find that the Appellant is not a credible witness and that the presumption of truthfulness of her sworn testimony is effectively rebutted.\n[61] I thus give no weight to the Appellant's testimony in establishing the veracity of her claim. As I have reviewed all of the corroborative evidence provided by the Appellant, and found that it is not sufficient to establish her allegations, I conclude that the Appellant has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that she is a genuine Christian convert, or that she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Iran due to her past Christian activities.\nThe Appellant has not established a sur place claim\n[62] I now turn my mind to the issue of whether there is sufficient evidence to establish a sur place claim for the Appellant, based on her activities in Canada.\n[63] Notwithstanding that the RPD found that the Appellant was not credible and did not establish her allegations, the RPD acknowledged that there was credible evidence that she had participated in Christian activities in Canada, including a baptism, and considered whether these activities established a sur place claim for the Appellant, such that she would be at risk on return on the basis of these activities. The RPD found that there was no evidence that the Appellant's religious activities in Canada have come to the attention of the Iranian authorities, or that they would be likely to in the future, on a balance of probabilities.\n[64] The Appellant has not disputed this finding on appeal. I find that the RPD erred in this finding by applying the balance of probabilities standard, as the likelihood of future persecution must be considered in terms of whether there is a serious possibility of such events occurring, rather than whether it is more likely than not to occur. However, I find that this is not a determinative error, as I find that the evidence does not establish a serious possibility that the Iranian authorities would become aware of the Appellant's religious activities in Canada, for the same reasons relied upon by the RPD in its analysis.21\n[65] I thus find that that the Appellant has not established a sur place claim for protection on the basis of her religious activities in Canada.\n[66] In my review of the record, I noted that the Appellant argued before the RPD that she would face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran as a returning failed asylum seeker.22 The RPD did not address this in its reasons, and the Appellant has not raised this issue on appeal. Notwithstanding, I have turned my mind to the issue.\n[67] I find that the preponderance of objective evidence indicates that Iranian authorities have little interest in prosecuting failed asylum seekers for activities conducted outside of the country, though high profile individuals and opposition activists may face a higher risk.23\n[68] The evidence indicates that while opposition activists can face imprisonment and harsh treatment on return, returnees without that profile have returned without any significant problems. There have been successful voluntary return programs put in place with the cooperation of the Iranian authorities, and the objective evidence indicates that individuals who are not high profile or wanted for a crime, typically do not attract the attention of the authorities on return.\n[69] While one source indicates that there is no guarantee that the authorities would not take punitive action against returnees, the standard is not whether the Appellant is guaranteed safety; rather, the issue is whether she faces a serious possibility of persecution or a s.97 risk on a balance of probabilities. I do not find that she faces such a risk based on her personal profile and the objective evidence. The Appellant has not established that she is a high-profile individual or activist, or that she is sought by the Iranian officials for a crime. As such, I find that she does not face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Iran as a returning failed asylum seeker.\nThe Appellant has not established that she has a residual profile that puts her at risk of future persecution\n[70] The RPD further considered that the Appellant raised allegations during the hearing that while in Iran, she had received warnings about dress code violations. The RPD found that the credibility of these allegations was undermined by their omission from her BOC narrative, which was not reasonably explained. As such, and in view of the Appellant's general lack of credibility, the RPD found that these allegations were not established on a balance of probabilities.\n[71] The Appellant has not addressed or disputed this finding on appeal. I agree with the RPD, for the reasons it gave,24 that the Appellant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish these allegations, on a balance of probabilities standard, or to establish that she faces a serious possibility of persecution on these grounds.\nCONCLUSION\n[72] The Appellant has failed to present sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish the allegations at the core of her claim for protection, or to establish that she faces a serious possibility of persecution, or a section 97 risk of harm on a balance of probabilities, if she returns to Iran.\n[73] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nCheryl Braden\nCheryl Braden\nJanuary 4, 2022\nDate\n1 M.C.I. v.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) who was a minor at the RPD but is now over 18, and her son XXXX XXXX XXXX (a minor born in 2012). Their claims were joined with claims by the Principal Appellant's sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellant) with her daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX (a minor born in 2013). The mother of each minor appellant is their Designated Representative for this proceeding.1\n[3] The refugee claims relate to the murder of the Associate Appellant's daughter-in-law, XXXX XXXX, who was married to the Associate Appellant's son, XXXX XXXX, in the Bahamas. XXXX body was found in September 2017 and XXXX was charged with her murder. XXXX spent two years in jail before being released on bail in June 2019. He is still in the Bahamas, as are several other adult children of the Principal and Associate Appellants. The Appellants allege persecution by XXXX family.\n[4] The Appellants obtained visas for Canada in September 2019 after suffering displacement from Hurricane Dorion. They claim that XXXX family members in the Bahamas were threatening them since her 2017 murder and they fear harm from XXXX family if they return to the Bahamas. They also alluded to general racial discrimination in the Bahamas because of their ancestry.\n[5] The family's claims were received at different times (October 4, 2019, and December 17, 2019) but joined for a hearing at the RPD on May 11, 2021, with counsel retained a few weeks before the hearing. Through Counsel, the family submitted items including identity information revealing that the parents of the Principal and Associate Appellants were born in Haiti and Jamaica, not the Bahamas. This raised the possibility of other countries of nationality where the Appellants could acquire citizenship.\nThe RPD Decision\n[6] The RPD concluded that the Principal and Associate Appellants could acquire citizenship in Jamaica and that they have no claim against Jamaica so cannot not avail themselves of protection in Canada. The Principal and Associate Appellants' mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was born in 1943 in Jamaica and moved to the Bahamas as a young woman. The RPD focused on Jamaica as a country of reference. Their father has lived in the United States for over 50 years and the RPD did not pursue Haiti as a country of reference based on his birth.\n[7] The RPD found that Jamaica is not a country of reference for the three children. However, the RPD dismissed the children's claims against the Bahamas because 1) they did not establish a nexus to a Convention2 ground, and 2) they are not persons in need of protection given they do not face the same risk as the Associate Appellant who, with her son XXXX, was the main target of XXXX family. The RPD found that the Appellants did not rebut the presumption of state protection in the Bahamas.\nDECISION\n[8] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and I concur with the RPD's analysis of the claims.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[9] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is expected to make decisions based on the Record of the RPD3 but will accept new evidence that meets legal requirements.\n[10] The Appellants presented the following evidence to the RAD:\n* An affirmation by the Associate Appellant (XXXX XXXX XXXX) dated August 16, 2021;\n* Exhibit \"A\": Screenshots of text messages dated July 2021 between the Associate Appellant (XXXX XXXX) and her adult daughter, XXXX XXXX;\n* Exhibit \"B\": Letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX each dated August 16, 2021, confirming ongoing and completed XXXX XXXX XXXX for the Principal Appellant (XXXX XXXX), her daughter (XXXX XXXX XXXX [a.k.a. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the Associate Appellant (XXXX XXXX); and,\n* Exhibit \"C\": A Progress XXXX XXXX XXXX Treatment for the Principal Appellant (XXXX XXXX), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated July 27, 2021, regarding symptoms of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[11] I accept the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada, but not the evidence contained in the affirmation from the Associate Appellant nor the related text messages about alleged ongoing problems in the Bahamas. To the extent that the affirmation contains argument it will be considered along with the memorandum of argument.\nThe law regarding new evidence\n[12] New evidence presented to the RAD must come with a statement that explains why that evidence should be admitted.4 That statement must show that the evidence:5\n* arose after the RPD Decision; or\n* was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n* could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to be brought to the RPD before its decision.\n[13] An appellant must also show how the evidence meets additional factors of relevance, newness and credibility.6\nMy analysis of the new evidence\n[14] All of the documents arose after the RPD Decision and were not available or could not have been brought to the RPD before its decision. However, only the XXXX XXXX meet additional tests for admissibility. The reports are relevant in the broadest sense of that term, new in the sense that they are capable of proving or contradicting facts about leaving the Bahamas, and they are credible as to their source and circumstance.\n[15] Factual information in the Associate Appellant's affirmation is not admitted because it is not relevant to the appeals. Firstly, evidence about why the family would find it hard to live in Jamaica is not relevant. They have not alleged fear of persecution or harm in Jamaica. Secondly, suggestions about a grandchild in the Bahamas being targeted by the alleged persecutors in the Bahamas is simply not relevant. It is also highly speculative so lacks credibility. The text messages offered in support of that speculation do not speak for themselves about who is afraid and why. The context suggested in the affirmation speculates that the texter fears the alleged persecutors but is too remote to be relevant or credible evidence about ongoing persecution of any of the Appellants. Finally, the affirmation talks about the situation of XXXX, the Associate Appellant's son and another daughter's challenges related to living in the Bahamas. That evidence is not relevant to these appeals. It does not directly relate to the Appellants themselves and is not relevant to the central issues on which this appeal turns. For the Principal and Associate Appellants, that central issue is the question of nationality in Jamaica. For their children, it is about the persecution in the Bahamas and state protection.\nANALYSIS\nJamaica as a country of nationality is confirmed\n[16] I confirm that Jamaica is a country of nationality for the same reasons provided by the RPD. Their mother was born in Jamaica and the Principal and Associate Appellants have access to citizenship in Jamaica because of their mother. They have made no claim against Jamaica so cannot obtain Canada's surrogate protection.\n[17] I agree with and adopt the RPD's explanation of the relevant legal principles in paragraphs 22 and 23 about country of nationality. The question of nationality requires evidence about:\n* a country's citizenship law and whether authorities in the country have discretion to refuse applications;\n* whether there are significant impediments that would prevent this Principal and Associate Appellant from exercising a right of citizenship in Jamaica; and, if so,\n* whether they made reasonable efforts to overcome such impediment.\n[18] I find the Principal and Associate Appellants have not made reasonable efforts to overcome impediments relating to obtaining citizenship in Jamaica. The Appellants had, admittedly, little time to prepare for the nationality issue at the RPD. They were given one day of notice before the RPD hearing to gather and present evidence and address the issue of Jamaica as a country of reference. That could be insufficient time to prepare for such a complex issue. However, their Counsel asked for and received time to do some post-hearing research and provided written submissions 10 days after the hearing. Even if 10 days was insufficient time for gathering evidence about nationality and country of reference, nothing more has been done since then. In preparing for this appeal, the Appellants were on notice that the matter of citizenship in Jamaica was a pivotal issue, yet their Appellants' Record does not indicate that any further efforts have taken place to find out about citizenship in Jamaica and if there are impediments.\n[19] On appeal, Counsel argued that the short notice for the Jamaican nationality issue prevented the Appellants from gathering documentary information about their circumstances to establish if, with reasonable effort, they can obtain Jamaican citizenship. Counsel argued that it was not reasonable for the RPD to conclude there is no clear and significant impediment to exercising any right they might have to Jamaican citizenship and pointed to their evidence about the lack of identity documents for their mother. That appeal argument does not respond to what the RPD identified as the main problem, which is that the Appellants did not show that they made reasonable efforts to overcome the impediment.\n[20] I agree with the RPD that there could be significant impediment to obtaining certificates of citizenship in Jamaica given that the Appellants lack of identity documents for their mother. However, I find that the Appellants have not shown reasonable efforts made to overcome the impediment. The Appellants have time after the RPD hearing and had several months since the RPD Decision to explore the matter of citizenship in Jamaica but have not presented evidence of doing so. The Appellants' Record does not indicate that any enquiries have taken place and there is no new evidence about that central issue. Instead, the appeal arguments highlight the lack of time to present evidence to the RPD but then rely on the same evidence that was before the RPD. That evidence is not enough to show that they made reasonable efforts to enquire about or overcome any impediments to citizenship.\n[21] At the RPD hearing, the Principal and Associate Appellants pointed out that they do not have an original of their mother's birth certificate or other identity documents for her because what they had was destroyed or lost after the 2019 hurricane. Their mother died in December 2012 so she cannot help them. The RPD agreed that this lack of documents is a serious impediment but found that the Appellants had not shown reasonable efforts to overcome the impediment. The RPD pointed out that they had time after the hearing to contact authorities in Jamaica for information about their circumstances and to get information about any obstacles that might exist. For example, the evidence suggests that their father is still alive but there is no indication that he was contacted or that any other relatives were contacted. The post-hearing submissions to the RPD did not contain that type of information. The evidence at the RAD does not offer any additional information either.\nThe children do not have claims under section 96\n[22] I agree with and adopt the law and conclusions set out in paragraphs 31 and 32 of the RPD Decision. The RPD concluded that the children have no nexus to a Convention ground and that their fears are better characterized as relating to retaliation and revenge from the family of XXXX.\n[23] The Appellants argue that the RPD characterized the children's fear incorrectly. I disagree. Their arguments suggest that the appellants are in a particular social group. The Appellants submit that their fear is due to the Principal and Associate Appellants' membership in a particular social group defined as \"women who become victims of abuse due to their familial ties to an individual accused of committing a serious crime or accused of having harmed a member of a prominent family.\"7 They submit that the RPD should have considered that the family ties are immutable characteristics along with related and intersecting factors of gender, family composition and racial background. I interpret the Appellants' argument to be that as women and single mothers of a minority ethnic background, the Principal and Associate Appellants fall within the category of a particular social group defined by the Supreme Court8 as \"groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic\". They seem to argue that the children of the Principal and Associate Appellants are targeted as a result of their mothers' membership in that particular social group.\n[24] It is evident that the adults in the two feuding families had negative interactions, but neither that nor the other suggested characteristics places the children into a particular social group for the purpose of a Convention ground. As explained correctly by the RPD, the children's fears most closely relate to personal family vendettas or being indirectly affected as victims of crime, rather than constituting persecution on a Convention ground. The children's claims relied on the evidence provided by the Principal and Associate Appellants about events of perceived retaliation and revenge after the 2017 murder. That evidence included specific occasions of tense and even assaultive interactions involving the Principal and Associate Appellants. The appeal arguments take issue with some of the RPD's factual descriptions or omissions about specific events, but the arguments do not show that those circumstances create a nexus to a Convention ground for the children.\nThe RPD's Section 97(1) analysis is confirmed\n[25] I agree with the RPD that the presumption of state protection was not rebutted in this case, and I endorse the RPD's statements of the relevant legal principles in paragraphs 35, 36, 43, 44 and 45 of the RPD Decision.\n[26] The three children of the Principal and Associated Appellant failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that the Bahamas will not provide adequate protection against what they fear may happen to them in the future, on a balance of probabilities. The children have not tested the effectiveness of state protection themselves but argued about perceptions of ineffectiveness in relation to their mothers' experiences. The appeal arguments emphasize the problems experienced by the Associate Appellant because she was implicated by her daughter-in-law's family for helping and defending her son. In their Basis of Claim forms, the Associate and Principal Appellants described specific interactions and events with additional information at the hearing. The RPD analyzed those events and offered the conclusion that the police provided adequate state protection and then concluded that the children would also likely enjoy state protection for any similar concerns. The RPD blended its analysis of state protection for the children with an evaluation of what the Principal and Associate Appellants had experienced and from that it correctly concluded that the presumption of state protection was not rebutted.\n[27] The appeal arguments allege errors in the RPD's analysis of state protection, but I find those arguments do not undermine the RPD's conclusions. I summarize and address the arguments as follows:\n* The Appellants submit that the RPD was selective and failed to consider contradictory country condition evidence from the Appellants by highlighting the problems that have been experienced by the Associate Appellant's son, XXXX. I agree that the RPD did not refer to the specifics offered in the Appellants' Memorandum, but find those references are not clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption of state protection for the children. Evidence of political corruption and even police misconduct are not sufficient, and the facts emphasized by the Appellants are mostly about the treatment of XXXX during his two years in jail for the murder charge. That does not equate to a lack of state protection for any challenges that the Appellant children have or may personally face in the future.\n* I agree that the RPD described some events imperfectly, such as conflating a February 2018 event and a July 2019 incident. However, the Appellants' Memorandum is then imprecise in suggesting that those were two 'assassination attempts' against the Associate Appellant. The Associate Appellant believed the daughter-in-law's family wanted to kill her and described her reasons for that belief. These were not actual assassination attempts but was evidence of the Associate Appellant's belief that XXXX family wanted to harm her. The allegation is that in February 2018 the daughter-in-law's family was planning to hire a hit man and that in July 2019 a bounty was placed on the Associate Appellant's head. The main point, as indicated by the RPD, was that police response to these concerns was adequate.\n* The Appellants allege that the RPD was required to but did not consider how the state police failed to enforce the law. This is a suggestion that cannot succeed without greater foundation. The Associate Appellant told the RPD Member that she went to the police twice: once about the bounty being placed on her head and also in relation to her son being charged for the murder. She was not satisfied with their responses. The RPD asked the Associate Appellant what she expected the police should have done, for example, after she reported the bounty, and she said, \"I would have wanted the police to do more than what they did.\"9 The RPD asked what that might be and she replied: \"arrest them for one, who knows that he won't probably go to somebody else who probably won't - wouldn't, you know, that wouldn't do it.\" In the Appellants' Memorandum, Counsel argues that the police failed to enforce the law because they made no inquiries and no questions were asked of the source of the threat, but that is not accurate. The Associate Appellant confirmed that the police spoke with her father-in-law about the bounty.10\n* The Appellants argue that the RPD did not take into consideration how well connected the persecutors are but did not provide trustworthy and credible evidence to support that allegation. The RPD correctly pointed out that state protection need not be perfect and that the objective country evidence indicates the Bahamas is a functioning democracy with demonstrable elements of state protection that show serious efforts to protect its citizens. It is not enough to simply suggest that a family has influence. The perception of ability to influence authorities must be accompanied by evidence sufficient to rebut the objective information of state administrations that generally operate in a lawful manner to protect citizens.\n* The Appellants argue that the Associate Appellant had been sexually assaulted when young and that this restricts her ability to trust or seek state protection. While unfortunate, that is not relevant or sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection for the children in this appeal. Similarly, the Appellant's general allegations of racial discrimination, ineffectiveness of police response after the Hurricane Dorion, or how environmental disasters regularly plague the Bahamas, are not indications that the police do not provide adequate protection. The evidence about specific events relating to the Appellants is not sufficient to show that the presumption of state protection is rebutted. Rather, the police responded when approached.\nMiscellaneous arguments that do not affect the outcome\n[28] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by failing to consider Chairperson Guideline 311 in the assessment of the children's claims. Guideline 3 is about processes for making sure claims by minor children are handled fairly. The minors in this case are not accompanied, nor did the Appellants argue that there was any procedural unfairness, other than having only short notice for addressing the issue of nationality\/country of reference. I have addressed that concern and it is not affected by Guideline 3.\n[29] The Appellants also point out the mistreatment or discrimination they have suffered in the Bahamas because of their gender, status as single parents, and for perceived minority ethnic status as children of foreigners. An unfortunate experience of general discrimination is not sufficient to ground these claims. The Appellants suggest that the various police and family interactions have a racial or discriminatory tone, but they have not established that any of the children will suffer harassment or discrimination amounting to persecution because of race or minority status. The incidents described relate to family disputes involving the Associate or Principal Appellant, and even if those events have a racial component, that is not sufficient to conclude a cumulative effect amounting to a likelihood of future persecution toward the children.\n[30] The effect of my decision is that the children are able to return to the Bahamas, while their mothers are expected to go to Jamaica if they fear persecution in the Bahamas. The possible outcome is that minor children will return to countries the Bahamas without their mothers. While that would be problematic, it is also possible that the minor children would be with their mothers in Jamaica. The potential separation of the minor children from their mothers is, in the circumstances, speculative. In any event, it is not a basis to allow the claims.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the Decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nM.

They fear an organized crime cartel who threatened and extorted Ms. XXXX father. The Appellants were also threatened when their family dogs were killed and dismembered bodies were found in a car close to their home. Their claims were denied by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) due to credibility concerns and viable Internal Flight Alternatives (IFA) in Merida and Cabo San Lucas. They allege that the RPD committed errors of natural justice, that their counsel was incompetent in her representation and that the RPD erred in its findings. While I agree that the RPD erred in several regards, I find that I can repair these errors in my independent assessment. I find that the determinative issues are the errors of the former counsel and the viability of an IFA.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellants allege that their father found a note in XXXX 2018 pinned to the front door of his clinic demanding protection money. After he refused to pay, a second note demanded additional money. XXXX XXXX days later, people came to their house and killed several of the family dogs and fired shots at the house. XXXX days after the initial contact, a car was found in their neighborhood with dismembered bodies. The family filed a police report about the extortion and provided a newspaper article regarding the dismembered bodies. In XXXX 2018, two of their father's brothers were tortured and killed. Mr. XXXX left Mexico in XXXX 2018 but reavailed to Mexico in XXXX 2018. He returned to Canada in XXXX 2019 and made his refugee claim in November 2019.\n[4] Ms. XXXX and Ms. XXXX base their claims on the same events.\n[5] Ms. XXXX was charged with numerous criminal offences while in Canada.1 She was also the victim of criminal offences by her former common-law spouse while in Canada.2 Mr. XXXX was charged with numerous criminal offences, in Canada, against Ms. XXXX, who subsequently requested that the Crown withdraw the charges.3 No outcomes of these charges are known to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).\n[6] The Appellants have alleged that their former counsel was incompetent in their representation by failing to assist them in preparing their Basis of Claim (BOC), by failing to translate the BOC, by failing to prepare them adequately for the hearing and by failing to submit corroborative evidence on their behalf.\n[7] After my review of the record, I asked the Appellants to provide a copy of the psychological report from G&R Wellness which was omitted from the RPD Record.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe evidence presented by the Appellants is accepted\n[8] Rule 294 provides that a document submitted after an appeal is perfected and must not be used in the appeal unless it is allowed by the RAD. In deciding whether to allow the use of a document not previously provided, the RAD must consider any relevant factors, including the document's relevance and probative value, any new evidence that the document brings to the appeal and whether the person who is the subject of the appeal, with reasonable effort, could have provided the document when the appeal was perfected. If the document is admitted under Rule 29, it must then be considered under the statutory criteria of section 110(4) of the Act,5 and the jurisprudential criteria of Singh\/Raza.6 The statutory criteria indicates that I can only accept evidence which arose after the RPD decision; or was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.7 If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, the jurisprudence indicates that I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.8\nProfessional Incompetence\n[9] All the documents provided in compliance with the Practice Notice are admitted. The Appellants have provided an affidavit from Mr. XXXX and text messages relating to their allegations of professional incompetence from their former counsel.9 In addition, former counsel has provided eight additional sets of email or text conversations with the Appellants.10 Former counsel has provided a memorandum of argument responding to the allegations of the Appellants. All of these documents met the requirements of Rule 29, section 110(4) and the Singh\/Raza criteria as they are relevant and essential to my assessment of allegations of breaches of natural justice. Curiously, these text messages between the Appellants and their former counsel do not overlap, meaning that there are almost no messages where I see the same message sent from one party and received by the other party. These messages give me an incomplete picture of the relationship between the parties.\nModelling evidence\n[10] The Appellants have provided a print-out from Facebook of the modelling work of Mr. XXXX and Ms. XXXX. I find that this document meets the requirements of Rule 29, section 110(4) and the Singh\/Raza criteria as the document is relevant to my assessment of their risk in the proposed IFA. While this evidence pre-dates the RPD hearing, I have also considered their allegation that they disclosed this evidence to their counsel prior to the RPD hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[11] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.11\nIneffective Assistance of Former Counsel\n[12] The Appellants have alleged that their former counsel was incompetent in their representation by failing to assist them in preparing their BOC, by failing to translate the BOC, by failing to prepare them adequately for the hearing and by failing to submit corroborative evidence on their behalf. The Appellants have complied with the requirements of the IRB Practise Notice on Allegations against Former Counsel. Their former counsel has provided a Reply and the Appellants have responded to that Reply. I have reviewed all of these submissions and the new evidence provided by the former counsel.\n[13] There is a two-part test for establishing ineffective assistance: counsel's acts or omissions constituted incompetence and substantial prejudice to the Appellant's claim resulted from those acts or omissions.12 The burden is on the Appellant to establish both parts of the test. Incompetence must be sufficiently specific and clearly supported by the evidence. 13 There is a strong presumption that the counsel's behaviour is within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. It is only in extraordinary circumstances that the incompetence leads to the conclusion that there was a breach of procedural fairness.14 To do that, it is necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the errors of former counsel, the result of the proceeding would have been different.15\n[14] The Appellants allege that the former counsel was incompetent in failing to assist them in preparing for the hearing and in not reviewing their BOC and other evidence with them. Their former counsel denies these allegations. There are multiple references in the RPD documents and forms, such as the BOC, to the need to swear to the veracity of the documents and to keep the RPD advised of any changes in their claim. The Appellants all have advanced education which belies their assertation that they would not understand the importance of a complete narrative. Their former counsel indicates that she met with them several times, including when their documents were translated. The text messages refer to multiple calls and meetings in XXXX 2019, XXXX 2019, XXXX 2020,16 XXXX 2020, XXXX 202017, XXXX 202118 and XXXX 2021.19 Former counsel has provided text messages of her efforts to contact them and her many reminders of the need to provide documents and information in support of their claim. I also note that the BOC forms all include minor changes initialed by the claimants showing that they did review their BOC forms prior to those forms being submitted to the RPD. I find that there was no incompetence.\n[15] The Appellants allege that the former counsel was incompetent in not reviewing the translation of their documents with the Appellants.20 They assert that they never met these translators. Former counsel denies these allegations and, further, indicates that Ms. XXXX said she did not need translation as she believed she had a high level of proficiency in English due to her four year relationship with an American. This relationship is noted in her Generic Application form.21 Former counsel also includes her recollection of a direct quote from Mr. XXXX about the completeness of the narrative. The RPD record also includes the sworn affidavits from translators that the translators met with the claimants and reviewed the translation with the claimants. The document from Ms. XXXX of XXXX 2019 regarding her miscarriage was also translated and sworn by the same translator. I find there was no incompetence.\n[16] The Appellants allege that their counsel was incompetent in failing to submit corroborative evidence of their claim. The evidence shows that the evidence of their modelling work was provided to counsel in June 2021, two days prior to the hearing, despite counsel's requests for corroborative evidence as early as XXXX 2020.22 The text messages corroborate that Mr. XXXX was surprised to learn that Ms. XXXX had not provided the evidence earlier.23 While I am not convinced that the omission of this evidence rises to the level of incompetence, I have remedied this error by considering this evidence as part of my independent analysis.\n[17] I find that the Appellants have not discharged their burden to show that they received ineffective assistance of counsel.\nNatural Justice Error of the RPD\n[18] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in not asking them to swear to accuracy, completeness and correctness of their BOC forms. Having reviewed the oral recording, I agree that the RPD erred. However, I note that the Appellants signed the attestations of veracity on the BOC forms and that the Appellants have provided a new BOC form which has been signed and sworn. I have considered these revised narratives in place of the original BOC forms. I find that I can remedy the RPD's error in my independent analysis based on the new BOC forms.\nConvention Refugee claim\n[19] The Appellants argue that their claim should have been assessed under section 96 due to their imputed political opinion based on the political activities of their father. Whether their claim is assessed under section 96 or section 97, a viable IFA is determinative of the claim. 24 For that reason, I have not considered the Appellants' arguments in regards to their status as Convention refugees.\nInternal flight alternative\n[20] The test for an IFA is two-pronged. Once an IFA is proposed, the claimant has the burden of proof to establish that (1) on a balance of probabilities, there is a serious possibility of being persecuted in the IFA or that he would be personally subject to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the proposed IFA, and (2) it is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh, in all circumstances, for the claimant to move to the proposed IFA.25 The RPD proposed Merida and Cabo San Lucas as IFAs for the Appellants. The law provides that once an IFA has been proposed, the Appellant bears the onus of proof.26\n[21] The Appellants allege that the RPD erred in numerous findings about their credibility. Given their allegations of a lack of translation of their first BOC and that this lack of translation impacted the RPD's findings, I have considered their second narrative which was signed and translated to them. I have only considered credibility issues as far as they relate to the determination of a viable IFA.\nIt is safe for the Appellants in the proposed IFA\n[22] A claimant has a safe IFA where he or she do not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm in the proposed IFAs. An IFA analysis requires a contextual approach, looking at the profile of the agent of harm, their motivation to search for the Appellants, and their ability to find the Appellants throughout Mexico. There can only be a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm if the agents of harm have both the \"means and the motivation\" to locate the Appellant.27\n[23] The Appellants argue that their counsel erred in not submitting corroborative evidence of their modelling work. While I agree that this was an error, I find that I can remedy this error in my independent analysis. Having reviewed and considered this evidence, I note that the Appellants exaggerate the nature of this evidence, being that they had national exposure and were national modeling champions. The evidence indicates that Ms. XXXX did XXXX in the Acapulco region (which she characterized as work for a XXXX XXXX in her texts)28 and worked as a XXXX until she left Mexico.29 The evidence indicates that Mr. XXXX was a teenage XXXX XXXX for XXXX and XXXX in 2017. Given that this experience dates from 2017 and limited scope of this XXXX exposure, I find that it does not establish, on a balance of probabilities that the proposed IFAs are unsafe for Mr. XXXX and Ms. XXXX.\n[24] The Apellants also argue that the criminal gang which terrorized their family is also active in Cabo San Lucas and in Merida. The RPD found that the Appellants were unable to provide specifics about the name or the identity of the group targetting them. Their new narrative names the group as the \"cartel del CIDA\". The country condition evidence does not include this group. Given the distance between the proposed IFAs and the family home, the length of time since the last contact with the group, the lack of information about the means of the criminal gang, I find that the Appellants have not established that they would be unsafe in the proposed IFA.\n[25] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in not considering that they had two uncles who were murdered by the cartel and not considering that these murders showed continued interest from the criminal gang. However, the RPD found that the Appellants were not credible in failing to mention that a second uncle was also murdered.The Appellants' amended narrative also retains this inconsistency. The information about the death of their uncle XXXX indicates that he died in XXXX 2018 from a gunshot wound. Neither the mother nor the father's affidavits mention that there has been further action against the family. Given that these murders occurred in 2018 and that there has been no further contact, other than inquiries to Mr. XXXX friends in 2018,30 I find that there is insufficient evidence that the criminal cartel continues to be motivated to find the Appellants.\n[26] The Appellants argue that the profile of their father will make the proposed IFAs unsafe. Their father is located in Acupaulo which is thousands of kilometres away from the proposed IFAs. There is no evidence, except Mr. XXXX contention, that his father's profile as a XXXX XXXX or his work in XXXX is such that he is known nationally. There is no mention of the father in the country condition evidence, nor any corroborative evidence provided by the Appellants about the father's profile. I find that there is insufficient evidence that the father's profile will make the proposed IFAs unsafe for the Appellants.\n[27] Finally, the Appellants argue that the RPD speculated on the motivation of the criminal gang to find them. It is not an error to examine past actions, having accepted that they are true, and make a prediction about future risk based on those past actions.31 There is no error in the RPD or the RAD making a finding about future risk, having considered the Appellant's past actions.32 Simply because the Appellant says that they are at risk in the future does not make it so.\n[28] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that there is no serious possibility of the Appellant being persecuted on a Convention ground, or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subject to a risk to life, or cruel and unusual punishment or treatment in the proposed IFAs.\nIt is reasonable for the Appellant to move to the proposed IFAs\n[29] In the second prong of the test, the claimant must show that the proposed IFAs are objectively unreasonable. \"Actual and concrete evidence\"33 is necessary to meet the very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. \"It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\"34 The burden is on the claimant to demonstrate that the proposed IFA is unreasonable or unduly harsh in his or her case.\n[30] The Appellants are all very well educated. Mr. XXXX has a degree in XXXX, MS. XXXX has a master's degree in XXXX XXXX and work experience in this XXXX XXXX.35 Ms. XXXX has 16 years education including being XXXX months short of finishing her XXXX degree. I find that the Appellants will be able to find employment and accommodation in the proposed IFAs.\n[31] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in not considering the psychological report regarding Ms. XXXX.36 The report regarding MS. XXXX indicates that she was diagnosed with XXXX in Mexico and has symptoms of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.37 She received twelve sessions of counselling. The report indicates that her symptoms continue, despite this counselling, and her counselling continues. The report indicates that Ms. XXXX lives independently, enjoys physical activity and has worked diligently on her mental health. The country condition evidence indicates that psychological counselling is available to victims of crime.38 I find that the psychological conditions of Ms. XXXX do not make the proposed IFAs in Mexico objectively unreasonable.\n[32] The Appellants have not contested the RPD's findings that the proposed IFAs would be reasonable in terms of language, housing, medical care, religion, education, travel, or other factors. Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that the Appellants have not discharged their burden of proof to establish that, on a balance of probabilities, there is a serious possibility of being persecuted in the IFA or that they would be personally subject to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the proposed IFAs. I also find that they have not shown that it is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh, in all circumstances, to move to the proposed IFAs.\nCONCLUSION\n[33] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPamela Arnott\nPamela Arnott\n4 January 2022\nDate\n1 RPD-1, RPD Record, Schedule A of Generic Application of Ms. XXXX, p. 61.\n2 RPD-1, RPD Record, Email of Detective Constable XXXX (XXXX 2021) at p. 311.\n3 RPD-1, RPD Record, Letter from XXXX XXXX (undated) p. 316.\n4 Refugee Appeal Division Rules, SOR\/2012-257, Rule 29.\n5 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended at subsection 110(4).\n6 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

I further find that the determinative factor regarding the application of both section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA is credibility. I therefore dismiss this appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.1\nOVERVIEW\n[3] The Appellant was born in Nigeria in 1978. He holds a XXXX XXXX in XXXX and received his designation as a XXXX XXXX in 2018. He and his wife have four children, the youngest of whom was born in 2015. In his Basis of Claim materials (BOC) the Appellant alleges that in 2013, he and his wife began to be harassed by members of her family to compel the Appellant to: a) pay his wife's family XXXX XXXX XXXX Naira; and b) participate in annual, familial conducted rituals, including female genital mutilation (FGM). The Appellant alleges that in 2019, the pressure from his wife's family escalated with her two male cousins -- XXXX and XXXX (\"the Cousins\")-threatening the Appellant and his wife. The Appellant alleges that he and his wife were attacked by the Cousins, accompanied by thugs, first on XXXX XXXX, 2019 at the Appellant's home, but their attackers were scared off when a neighbour called the police. The Appellant alleges that he was taken to the hospital and reported the attack to the police after being discharged. The Appellant further alleges that on XXXX XXXX, 2019, his car was shot at as he was driving his relative, X to the XXXX. The Appellant alleges that, in response, he decided immediately not to return home but to fly to Abuja with X, where he stayed, with X, for approximately XXXX weeks. The Appellant alleges that his presence at X's house was inadvertently discovered by the Cousins, who came to X's house one day when the Appellant and X were away at a local XXXX. In response to the threats the Cousins left with X's wife, the Appellant fled to the home of another relative, EE, in Port Harcourt, where, ten days later, his presence was again discovered by the Cousins, when - again -- the Appellant happened to be out on an errand. In response, on XXXX XXXX, 2019, the Appellant fled to Canada as he already held a visitor's visa that would not expire until XXXX XXXX, 2020 and filed for protection. A hearing was held on May 17, 2021 and on June 17, 2021, the Appellant's claim was refused on the grounds that the RPD did not find the Appellant credible. It is from this decision that the Appellant now appeals.\n[4] In its decision the RPD made the following findings:\na) that the Appellant's credibility was undermined by several omissions, inconsistencies, and convoluted and evolving testimony;\nb) his allegations were not substantiated by credible and trustworthy evidence;\nc) the inconsistencies and omissions were not resolved by the assessment of a psychotherapist; and\nd) the documentary evidence disclosed did not overcome the credibility issues.\n[5] On appeal, the Appellant now argues that:\ni. the RPD engaged in microscopic analysis,\nii. ignored or misunderstood the evidence disclosed,\niii. failed to properly incorporate the assessment of the psychotherapist in the RPD's assessment of the Appellant's testimony, and\niv. erred in its overall assessment of the Appellant's credibility.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The Appellant has disclosed photographs of an external view of his residence in XXXX, Ogun State as new evidence. He argues that he is disclosing these photographs to substantiate his testimony that at the time of the first (XXXX XXXX, 2019) attack on the Appellant and his wife, their neighbour was within the compound they shared, but not within the Appellant's own apartment. This distinction, the Appellant argues, is significant and relevant because the RPD found that the Appellant's testimony evolved with respect to the presence of their neighbour in their apartment. The Appellant first testified that the neighbour was present and subsequently testified that the neighbour was not present in the Appellant's apartment but heard the noise from outside.\n[7] According to the Law,2 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n(iv) If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.3\n[8] Here, the Appellant argues that he could not reasonably have been expected to anticipate that the RPD would assess his credibility based on whether his neighbour could see and hear both the Appellant and his wife being attacked by her family members in their apartment. I also find that these photographs are credible and relevant to the inquiry at hand and new insofar as they were unknown to the RPD before rendering its decision. I admit these photographs and find that the Appellant could not have been expected to anticipate that the question of whether the neighbour could be within the compound, but not within the apartment would arise at the RPD hearing.\n[9] The Appellant has not requested an oral hearing.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (\"RAD\")\n[10] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.4\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE\n[11] I find the determinative issue in the appeal is the Appellant's credibility.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[12] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant's credibility has been undermined by omissions in his narrative and testimony, inconsistencies, and evolving or frequently non-responsive testimony at the hearing.\nThe attack of XXXX XXXX, 2019 and the police report dated XXXX XXXX, 2019\n[13] I find the RPD erred in its interpretation of the Appellant's testimony regarding whether his neighbour was present within the Appellant's apartment or present within the compound of apartment building, and thereby able to ascertain whether an attack was taking place. At the RPD hearing, the Appellant testified that on XXXX XXXX, 2019, he, his wife, and one of his daughters were at home and one of his neighbours was \"at his house\". Subsequently, the Appellant testified that when the Cousins attacked him, a neighbour tried to gain entrance to the apartment but could not enter and called the police.5 The Appellant was subsequently asked again who called the police and how had they learned of the assault; the Appellant testified that his neighbour, \"was not allowed to come in, she was not able to come in, it was the noise that she overheard, that she had to call the police that something wrong was going on.\" The Appellant subsequently clarified that the neighbour was not in the Appellant's apartment, but in the compound. The RPD found this testimony to be convoluted and evolving. On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding the testimony unreasonable and disclosed photographs to show how someone standing in the compound of the apartment building would be able to see an attack taking place in a ground-floor apartment. I have reviewed the Record before me. I find that the Appellant's initial testimony that one of his neighbour's was \"at his house\" could equally apply to the neighbour being at home in the building, within the compound--not necessarily within the Appellant's own apartment. I accept, therefore that when the Appellant subsequently testified that the neighbour was not physically within the Appellant's apartment, he was clarifying, his testimony, not revising evolving testimony.\n[14] However, I find that the Appellant's account of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 attack is undermined by omissions from his BOC. At the hearing, the Appellant testified that the day after the attack, he accompanied the police to the attackers (the Cousins') house, only to find them not at home and the house locked. This was not included in his BOC, where the Appellant stated only that he reported the attack to the police station on XXXX XXXX and that the police began searching for the assailants, and the police did not make an arrest and took no further actions (although the Appellant was told the police continued to search for his attackers).6 The Appellant was asked at the hearing why he omitted from his BOC any mention of going to the Cousins' house with the police on XXXX XXXX, 2019, the day after the attack. The Appellant was not responsive in his reply:\nCLAIMANT: So, we took them to the house, took police to XXXX and XXXX house but they were not at home on that day, the doors were locked. And the police said they will be on the search for them.\nMEMBER: What day did you go with the police to their house?\nCLAIMANT: The same day, on the XXXX.\nMEMBER: The XXXX. How come you did not include that in your ... your Basis of Claim Form?\nCLAIMANT: I did not put any information on the Basis of Claim ... on the Basis of Claim, yes, it is there that I reported to the police there. You mean my story?\nMEMBER: Yeah, just ... help me understand why you did not include the fact that you went to their house with the police?\nCLAIMANT: No, normally when we give them the address, so we had to go with the police to their home.\nMEMBER: Okay. Okay, what happened after that?7\n[15] The Appellant is a well-educated man, fluent in English, who completed his BOC while represented by counsel. His BOC is replete with detail. I do not accept that had the Appellant gone with the police to search for the Cousins at their house, he would have failed to include this material detail in his BOC. I find the omission of the Appellant searching for the Cousins with the police -- and this omission's inconsistency with his testimony -- undermines his credibility.\nThe alleged assassination attempt on the XXXX to the XXXX\n[16] I find that the Appellant's credibility is undermined both by the inconsistencies between his testimony at the hearing and his BOC account of the assassination attempt on the XXXX to the XXXX. The Appellant alleged in his BOC that:\nIn the afternoon of XXXX XXXX, 2019, my vehicle was trailed and I narrowly escaped from being assassinated when the assailants shot at my vehicle along XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, on my way to drop at the XXXX, my cousin, XXXX XXXX, who was returning to Abuja after a short visit. [emphasis added]\n[17] At the hearing, the Appellant initially testified that \"my cousin came from Abuja, he came on a visit...When I was taking him to the XXXX I got attacked on the way and fortunately we were able to escape the incident.\" The Appellant was later asked by the RPD whose car was used on the drive to the XXXX. The Appellant then testified that it was not his car, it was the car of a friend, who had also been present when shots were fired at the car. He further testified that the friend had been sitting in the rear seat of his own car while the Appellant drove the three of them to the XXXX.8 The Appellant was asked why he did not include the presence of the friend in his BOC. He testified he did not know.9 The RPD found the Appellant's response unreasonable. The RPD further found that, given the Appellant's XXXX degree of education and sophistication (as evidenced by his professional designation and participation in international conferences), that his omitting from his otherwise very detailed BOC - and from his initial testimony-- the presence of a central witness to an assassination attempt that forms the essential foundation of his claim, was equally not reasonable and had a negative impact on his credibility.\n[18] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD is being microscopic in its analysis, that the Appellant's use of the pronoun \"my\" was not used to indicate ownership of the vehicle, but only to signal that this particular car was the vehicle in which the Appellant had been driving. The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred in placing too great an emphasis on the absence of the friend travelling in the back seat of his own car from the BOC and that the Appellant's XXXX XXXX could explain why the Appellant remembered X being with him in the car, but not the friend the car belonged to. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in not taking the Appellant's XXXX XXXX into account in its analysis.\n[19] I have independently examined the Record before me. I find the Appellant's credibility is undermined by his omissions and evolving testimony. The Appellant is a XXXX educated person, with a XXXX XXXX -in XXXX-who holds an XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX, as is evidenced not only by his absence of an interpreter at the RPD hearing, but also by the XXXX and XXXX used in his written narrative and testimony. He was represented by competent counsel at the time he swore his BOC narrative was complete and true. His BOC is detailed -- to the point of explaining exactly which errands he was running both in Abuja (XXXX) and Port Harcourt (XXXX out his XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX) when the Cousins discovered his refuges. In his BOC, the Appellant stated \"...my vehicle was trailed and I narrowly escaped from being assassinated when the assailants shot at my vehicle.\" I do not accept the Appellant's argument that this is simply a misuse of pronouns and he actually meant that it was his friend's car. I find that when the Appellant stated in his BOC that \"my vehicle was trailed\" and \"assailants shot at my vehicle\" he meant exactly what he said -it was his vehicle. I would also observe that the XXXX XXXX, 2020 affidavit of X (who was the relative being taken to the XXXX), refers to the car as belonging to the Appellant. The affidavit states the Appellant was \"taking me to XXXX XXXX to XXXX a XXXX XXXX to Abuja, on our way his vehicle was attacked.\"10 I similarly do not accept the Appellant's argument that the RPD is placing too great an emphasis on the Appellant's failure to include in his BOC, the presence of a potential eye-witness to this alleged assassination attempt on the XXXX to the XXXX. X's affidavit does not refer to a third party being present. Moreover, I do not accept that the Appellant, as an educated man, represented by counsel, would not include in his BOC an eye-witness -- present in the car -- had this eye witness in fact been driving with X and the Appellant. I have read the Psychotherapy Assessment Report by Dr. XXXX and considered whether this omission and the evolving testimony regarding who owned the car and whether the friend was present on the drive to the XXXX, could be caused or exacerbated by the Appellant's XXXX XXXX.11 Although the report includes the Appellant presenting with XXXX XXXX and the doctor's assessment that the Appellant is likely to feel \"excessively XXXX and XXXX,\" XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, XXXX XXXX is not one of the listed symptoms reflecting his XXXX XXXX.12\nThe attempted attack in Port Harcourt\n[20] The Appellant stated in his BOC that the assailants came to his relative XXXX house where he was hiding in Port Harcourt, while he was out at a XXXX XXXX XXXX his XXXX XXXX. He stated in his BOC that the assailants told EE they had to kill the Appellant because he \"had the guts to report their principal XXXX to the police.\"13 The Appellant testified that the assailants did not identify their boss to XXXX as they ransacked her apartment, but that they told her that the police were searching for their boss and thus they had to find the Appellant. The RPD questioned the Appellant as to why his BOC included an account of the assailants identifying their boss to XXXX. The Appellant was not able to clarify and testified only that it was in his BOC because he put it there. The RPD, having examined XXXX's own affidavit, found no resolution for the discrepancy between the Appellant's BOC and his testimony and gave it no weight in corroborating the Appellant's BOC. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in misinterpreting the evidence before it as the affidavit of XXXX was consistent with the Appellant's testimony that no name was provided to EE by the assailants.\n[21] I have reviewed the Record before me, including the affidavit of EE, which makes no mention of the assailants identifying their boss. I find that the Appellant's testimony is at odds with his BOC and this undermines his credibility. But the Appellant's testimony is also at odds with the affidavit of XXXX, which does not -in any way-- mention the assailants telling her that they had to find the Appellant because the police were searching for their boss. The Affidavit of XXXX states simply that the assailants said they had a mission to kill the Appellant because they had been paid to do so. The affidavit of XXXX does not mention either the assailants' boss or the police searching for him. I find this discrepancy, too, undermines the Appellant's credibility.\nThe RPD did not err in its interpretation of the other documentary evidence\n[22] I find the evidence supplied by XXXX (both the WhatsApp screenshot of an alleged text conversation between \"XXXX\" a relative of the Appellant's wife (dated XXXX XXXX, 2021)14 and XXXX affidavit, dated seven days earlier, on XXXX XXXX, 202115 to both be without merit. The RPD did not address the WhatsApp screenshot - which was shown to the RPD at the hearing and submitted in hard copy, post-hearing -- in its Reasons. The Appellant argues, on appeal, that the screenshot enhances the Appellant's credibility as it speaks directly to the threat he is under in Nigeria as the screenshot contains a confession from XXXX that she tipped the Cousins to the Appellant's whereabouts in Port Harcourt. I have reviewed the Record before me. I find that the two documents -screenshot and affidavit -- are at odds with each other and neither are credible. In the screenshot, XXXX texts the Appellant that she had been kidnapped by the Cousins' gang, kept prisoner for XXXX days and beaten until she told them where they could find the Appellant in Port Harcourt. The Affidavit from XXXX (written the previous week) recounts a completely different story: that in 2019 she had been in a conversation with one of the Cousins who threatened the Appellant and that XXXX thereupon went directly to the Appellant and warned him of the threat. XXXX also affirms in her affidavit, that one of the Cousins had called her in XXXX 2020, and then again in XXXX 2020, confirming that it was he who had attacked the Appellant and swore to find him. Nowhere in her affidavit does XXXX in any way mention having been kidnapped, held prisoner, beaten or that she was responsible for tipping the Cousins that the Appellant was hiding in Port Harcourt.\n[23] In response to this discrepancy, I gave notice to the Appellant and the Minister on December 14, 2021, requesting - as the discrepancy between the two documents had not been canvassed at the hearing - clarification regarding the discrepancy.16 On December 30, 2021, the following response (the \"Response\") was received from the Appellant's lawyer:\n\"1. The affidavit from [XXXX], dated XXXX XXXX, 2021 was made based on what she had told the Appellant up to the point the affidavit was drafted and signed. Initially she did not want to tell the Appellant that she had been kidnapped by XXXX XXXX and told the kidnappers of his whereabouts because she had been threatened that she should not tell anyone or else she would suffer serious harm.\n2. However, XXXX eventually confessed to the Appellant's wife that she told his whereabouts to XXXX because she was kidnapped and was threatened to be killed if she failed to do so. She informed the Appellant of this conversation on XXXX XXXX, 2021 through the WhatsApp conversation.\"17\n[24] This Response was not provided in the form of a sworn statement from the Appellant, his wife or XXXX herself. Instead, the Appellant's counsel seeks himself to provide information as to XXXX's state of mind and motivation for providing a false, inaccurate, and misleading sworn statement, without providing any evidentiary foundation regarding how he obtained this knowledge. On that basis alone, I find the Response to be without merit and I give it little weight. Nonetheless, I find that this Response from the Appellant's lawyer clarifies that in her affidavit, written on XXXX XXXX, 2021, XXXX knowingly provided an affidavit that gave a partial and misleading account of events, that she herself contradicted seven days later. I find this discrepancy undermines the credibility of a) the affidavit, b) the screenshot, and c) XXXX as an affiant. I therefore find XXXX to not be credible, and I give neither XXXX affidavit nor her subsequent screenshot any weight whatsoever. I further find that these documents also undermine the credibility of the Appellant as he provided two, entirely disconnected, contradictory narratives regarding his alleged peril.\n[25] For all the above reasons, I find the Appellant not credible in establishing the determinative facts that would support his claim of a well-founded fear of persecution from his family.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAndrea Poole\nAndrea Poole\nJanuary 14, 2022\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, (IRPA) S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, at para. 111(1)(a).\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, subsection 110(4).\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

I have conducted an independent analysis of all the evidence concerned, including the entire record and the oral testimony. I find the RPD was correct that the Appellants are not credible, and I deny the appeal.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Appellants are citizens of Jordan. The Principal Appellant is 23 years old, and the Associate Appellant is 21 years old. Their claims were joined by the RPD as is allowed under RPD Rule 55.1 They allege as follows. They fear persecution from the authorities in Jordan because of their political opinion. The Appellants took part in a protest in Irbid, Jordan in XXXX 2018 in which they demonstrated against the King of Jordan, cursed him, and opposed his new tax laws. After the protest, security forces raided their family home and arrested them. They were initially detained for 18 days and were tortured. After that they were detained many times, and they were subjected to beatings and torture on each occasion. The Principal Appellant fled Jordan for Canada on a student permit in XXXX 2019, and the Associate Appellant fled on the same basis in XXXX 2019.\nRPD FINDINGS\n[3] The RPD found material aspects of the refugee claim are not credible because of discrepancies between the evidence and the Basis of Claim (BOC) forms, and because of various inconsistencies, omissions and implausibilities. The RPD gave no weight to the corroborative evidence supplied by the Appellants.\nAPPELLANTS' ARGUMENTS\n[4] The Appellants allege inadequate representation by their former Counsel. They submit his legal assistance was so poor that it raises multiple issues of procedural fairness. They state that their former Counsel has been suspended by the Law Society of Ontario for professional misconduct. They also allege errors on the part of the RPD, including ignoring some of the documentary evidence provided, and ignoring portions of the country condition's evidence.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe new evidence supplied by the Appellants is partly admissible\n[5] The Appellants have supplied new evidence, in the form of affidavits. According to section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),2 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[6] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.3\n[7] The affidavits of both Appellants appear to make the same statements, with a slight variation in paragraphs 17 to 19 in respect of which of the Appellants suffered what injuries.\n[8] I find paragraphs 1 to 7 of both affidavits contain information that was already before the RPD, and as such they do not amount to new evidence which would meet the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[9] I find paragraphs 26 to 38 of the affidavits attempt to restate the facts upon which the Appellants' claims are based. As such, the facts in the affidavit were already provided, or could reasonably have been provided, prior to the RPD Decision, if not in their BOCs or associated narratives then in the Appellants' oral testimony, and they do not amount to new evidence which would meet the requirements of section 110(4). An appeal before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is also not a de novo hearing. I do not admit these parts of the affidavit.\n[10] The remaining portions of these affidavits, being paragraphs 8 to 25, relate to the Appellants' allegations of inadequate representation by their former Counsel, and in fairness to the Appellants, I will admit them, except for paragraphs 17 to 19 which I find do not meet the requirements of section 110(4) because they attempt to re-state facts that were before the RPD. I find the remaining portions of paragraphs 8 to 25 of the affidavits meet the Raza criterion of credibility, as on their face they appear to emanate from the Appellants and to be sworn statements of fact based on their first-hand knowledge. They meet the Raza criterion of newness because they could be capable of proving facts that were unknown to the Appellants at the time of their hearing as they relate to the competence of their former Counsel. They meet the Raza criterion of relevance because they could be capable of proving facts that are relevant to the claim for protection, again in connection with the competence of their former Counsel. I therefore admit these portions of the affidavits.\nTHE RAD WILL NOT HOLD AN ORAL HEARING\n[11] As per the requirements of section 110(6)4 of the IRPA, the RAD will not hold an oral hearing in this case, because the new evidence in this case it is not dispositive of the claim.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[12] In accordance with the decision in Huruglica,5 when reviewing the Decision of the RPD, I have applied a standard for my review of correctness while conducting an independent assessment of the entirety of the evidence before me.\nANALYSIS\nThe Appellants have followed an appropriate procedure when complaining about their former Counsel's conduct and competence\n[13] As explained below, I find the Appellants have complied with the substantive requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) Practice Directions contained in the Practice Notice entitled, \"Allegations Against Former Counsel.\"\n[14] As a part of the record before me, which includes the Immigration and Refugee Board's (IRB's) electronic file records, I have a copy of a letter dated October 2, 2021 in which the Appellants' present Counsel wrote to their former Counsel advising him of the allegations the Appellants are making and giving him 10 days to respond. I do not have evidence that this former Counsel has responded, either to the IRB, or to the Appellants' Counsel.\n[15] In these circumstances, I find that on a balance of probabilities on the evidence available to me, the Appellants' former Counsel has not replied to the allegations and that the Appellants' complaint is appropriately made, substantially in accordance with the IRB Practice Notice.\n[16] I note also that the Appellants, in their Application to the IRB for an extension of time made on August 25, 2021, have provided evidence that their former Counsel, a paralegal in Ontario, is under suspension by the Law Society of Ontario (LSO). The evidence shows this suspension occurred after the RPD Hearing. This evidence does not show that the paralegal was suspended because of his conduct relating to the Appellants' RPD Hearing.\nIt is not necessary for me to determine whether the Appellants' former Counsel was incompetent\n[17] Irrespective of whether the Appellants are correct in their allegations that their Counsel at the RPD failed to prepare them properly for the Hearing, I find as explained below that their complaint and their affidavits provided on appeal are not determinative of the claim because there are remaining credibility issues on which I agree with the RPD, and which I find are sufficient to dispose of their claim.\n[18] The Courts have established requirements to find incompetence on the part of Counsel which include a requirement that a miscarriage of justice resulted (prejudice component).6 In the present case, as explained further in my reasons, I have not relied on issues in which ineffective assistance on the part of Counsel could have had a meaningful impact on the outcome, such as in the preparation of the Appellants' BOCs. I have relied in the credibility findings that follow only on the oral testimony the Appellants gave, and on the documents they have themselves provided. Even if their former Counsel did not prepare the Appellants well for their hearing, the Appellants had an opportunity at the Hearing, where they are testifying directly and not through Counsel, to put their case and to respond to the credibility concerns with which the RPD confronted them.\n[19] Despite the fact that the Appellants have had the assistance of a different legal Counsel on appeal, I find there are numerous remaining credibility issues with the Appellants' claims, not dependent on their former Counsel, which have not been reasonably explained, and which are enough in themselves to determine that the Appellants' appeals are bound to fail. I find for instance, as explained further below, that the Appellants have not reasonably explained why they cannot recall the dates of their detentions, cannot describe the rooms in which they were held or reasonably explain their inability to do so, and have not reasonably explained how their father was allegedly able to assist them to evade exit controls, while being unable to prevent his younger son from being repeatedly tortured while, as per the evidence he gave and the address history he supplied7 he remained in Jordan for seven months after his alleged initial detention in XXXX 2018, until XXXX 2019. Accordingly, I find that in this instance a miscarriage of justice at the RPD has not been demonstrated. In these circumstances, an issue of natural justice does not arise. The RAD will not assess the conduct of the Appellants' former Counsel further in this case.\nThe Appellants are not credible as to who they allege arrested them\n[20] The question of who arrested the Appellants is clearly related in this instance to a central aspect of their claim, namely their initial detention.\n[21] The RPD found that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Principal Appellant, gave inconsistent testimony when asked whether he and his brother were arrested by Jordanian intelligence or by Jordanian security forces. He initially stated that he was arrested by Jordanian intelligence. When questioned further, he testified that these are separate entities, but subsequently he stated that intelligence is part of the security forces. When the RPD questioned the Principal Appellant further on this point by asking why his BOC states he was arrested by security, he confirmed that when he was asked what happened when completing his BOC, he stated the people who arrested him were from security, and he was not asked whether they were from security or intelligence. He further explained that intelligence is part of the security services. He subsequently stated that he was arrested by \"the forces of the intelligence.\"\n[22] The Appellants submit in paragraph 8c of the Appellants' Memorandum that \"the Appellants were taken by official forces who were dressed in police uniforms.\"\n[23] This submission is however inconsistent with the testimony of the Principal Appellant that he and his brother were arrested by intelligence services, who, as noted above, he testified wore normal clothing.\n[24] I find the inconsistency in who it was that allegedly arrested the Appellant has not been reasonably explained. This finding is not dependent on the advice or assistance of the Appellants' former Counsel or on the completion of their BOCs, as the Principal Appellant himself testified that his BOC correctly reflects the statement he made while completing it that he was arrested by security. This statement in his BOC clearly contradicts his initial testimony to the RPD that he was arrested by Jordanian intelligence, which he repeated in subsequent testimony.\n[25] The Principal Appellant testified that the Jordanian security forces are different from the intelligence forces\/services, and they are obviously so based on their uniforms or lack thereof. The objective evidence also lends support to the contention that Jordanian security forces and Jordanian intelligence services are different. It states that the Public Security Directorate (PSD), the gendarmerie, and the Civil Defense Directorate report to the Ministry of the Interior, while the General Intelligence Directorate report directly to the King.\n[26] In other words, the evidence before me clearly does not establish that Jordanian intelligence and security are the same bodies, and the Appellants have not reasonably explained the discrepancy in the testimony as to who arrested them and the clothing those persons wore. I find this relates to a central aspect of their claim, namely their initial arrest, and I count this inconsistency in the question of who allegedly arrested the Appellants against their credibility.\nThe Appellants have not adequately explained why they cannot recall details of the rooms in which they allege they were detained\n[27] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant could not recall details of the room in which he was allegedly held for 18 days, other than that it was dark. The RPD found that his brother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Associate Appellant, described the room where he was held as extremely dark and said he could not remember anything. The RPD noted the Appellants did not testify they were blindfolded the whole time they were held in their rooms, and that the Associate Appellant testified he could see people from his room.\n[28] On appeal, Counsel has not made any submissions that relate specifically to this issue. The only submission of Counsel which could, in my view, have an impact on this question is her submission that the Appellants were tortured, and that the RPD \"failed to evaluate the plausibility of an altered state of consciousness\" as a result of the Principal Appellant's leg having been broken in two places.\n[29] I find the RPD asked questions several times about the rooms in which the Appellants were held. The Appellants have not provided any evidence to show that their memories have been affected by torture, and it was open to them to introduce such new evidence on appeal. Moreover, while the Principal Appellant testified that his leg had been broken, the Associate Appellant testified he was tortured but had \"no injuries\" when he first emerged from detention, just bruises. After subsequent detentions and beatings, allegedly sustained while he continued to attend high school, according to the Associate Appellant he had only bruises and no injuries.\n[30] I find, considering the totality of the explanations that have been given, that the Appellants have not reasonably explained why they cannot recall any details of the rooms where they were held. Even if the rooms were dark, the Associate Appellant stated that he was taken from one room to the other and saw \"different people.\" I agree with the RPD that if the Appellants were held for 18 days and the Associate Appellant was able to see and identify different persons, that he, at a minimum, would be able to discern some details of a room or rooms where he was held, even if they were relatively dark. As the RPD noted, the Appellants were not blindfolded the entire time, and I find they could reasonably be expected to provide some details, e.g. the size and overall shape of the room, whether the rooms had any windows or other openings to provide ventilation, whether the room had a keyhole through which an outside corridor was visible, whether there was a slot through which they received food, and if not, what they were able to see after the door was opened to bring food into the room.\n[31] In the absence of any further explanation as to why the Appellants are unable to recall these details, I find, in common with the RPD, that it is not credible that the Appellants cannot remember any details of the rooms in which they claim to have been detained. I find this too is related to a central aspect of the claim, namely whether they were initially detained as they claim, and I count this matter against their credibility.\nIt is not credible that the Appellants cannot recall any of the dates of their other detentions\n[32] The RPD noted that both Appellants could not say on what date they were detained subsequently, although the Principal Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, testified he had been detained for between 20 to 23 days, and the Associate Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, testified he had been detained about 20 times.\n[33] The Associate Appellant explained that the detentions would occur on his way back home, and that he does not pay attention to dates. Counsel has not made further submissions on appeal regarding this finding of the RPD.\n[34] I agree with the RPD that the Appellants have not reasonably explained why they cannot provide any dates when their detentions occurred, and I find again that this is a matter that is central to the claim, namely whether the Appellants were detained following their initial alleged detention, and I count this against the credibility of the Appellants.\nThe absence of a letter from their father counts against the Appellants' credibility\n[35] The RPD notes in paragraph 37 of its Decision the oral testimony of the Appellants that their father had sent a letter in support of their claim. In the Appellants' Memorandum, Counsel blames prior Counsel for this.\n[36] Irrespective of whether this allegation against Counsel is correct, it was open to the Appellants on appeal to introduce a copy of their father's letter, but, significantly in my view, this has not been done. Since the Appellants were effectively put on notice by the RPD of the desirability of proving this letter, but no letter has been provided and this weighs against their credibility. Additionally, if it was not feasible to obtain a copy of the father's letter, it was open to Appellants' Counsel to explain why a copy of this letter is not available for presentation to the RAD. In these circumstances, I count this failure to provide a copy of the father's letter against the credibility of the Appellants.\nThe Appellants have not reasonably explained how their father could help them evade exit controls\n[37] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant testified that nobody can interfere with affairs of Jordanian intelligence while at the same time testifying that his father talked to someone who helped him through security at the airport when he left. He agreed that Jordan has exit controls which would reasonably prevent someone like him from leaving the country but indicated that his father helped him evade them.\n[38] Counsel for the Appellants has offered no reasonable rebuttal to this finding. As per the Appellants submissions on appeal, their father explained this in his letter. This letter is allegedly lost, but as previously noted no copy of this letter has been provided on appeal, and even assuming it is correct that prior Counsel lost the letter, no explanation has been provided as to why the father has not supplied another copy of the letter.\n[39] In my independent assessment, I agree with the RPD that, on a balance of probabilities, this oral testimony of the Principal Appellant that his father was able to help him evade exit controls but was unable to prevent him from continuing to be tortured repeatedly after the initial detention is contradictory. I draw a negative inference from this contradiction, and from the failure of the Appellants to reasonably explain, including on appeal, how their father was able to enable their passage through Jordanian exit controls.\nThe Associate Appellant has not reasonably explained why he delayed leaving Jordan\n[40] The RPD noted the testimony of the Associate Appellant that he remained in high school in Jordan although he continued to be detained and tortured on many occasions. When the RPD asked the Associate Appellant why he could not have finished high school in Canada, he did not reply. On appeal, Counsel submits that the RPD has misapprehended the evidence, and that the Associate Appellant needed to finish high school in Jordan. Counsel states that it is easier to obtain a student permit to study in a college in Canada than it is to obtain a student permit to study in high school.\n[41] I do not accept this last statement by Counsel, which I find is speculative. No objective or other evidence has been offered that it is easier to obtain a student permit if the applicant has an acceptance letter from a college in Canada rather than an acceptance letter from high school. Moreover, it is clear from the evidence that the Associate Appellant made no attempt to obtain a student permit until after he finished high school. I agree with the RPD that if the Associate Appellant was tortured 20 or 30 times while was still in high school, it is reasonable to expect that he would investigate the possibility of fleeing to Canada as soon as possible, whether through a student permit or by other means, yet his only explanation for waiting is his need to finish high school.\n[42] This delay in leaving also undermines the credibility of the Appellants' contention that they were detained and tortured on between 20 to 30 occasions after they were initially held, and I draw a further negative inference against their credibility.\nThe medical reports on the Appellants are not probative of their allegations of torture\n[43] The RPD records in its decision that the Principal Appellant first testified that he brought a medical report with him to Canada. Subsequently, he testified that his father sent this form to him in Canada.\n[44] He alleges this form refers to the injuries he sustained when he was initially detained and tortured.\n[45] Counsel argues on appeal that the patient could have been in an \"altered state of consciousness\" because of two leg fractures. I find this is speculation and is not supported by any other evidence.\n[46] Nevertheless, I do accept the explanation of the Principal Appellant for this discrepancy. When questioned by the RPD about the discrepancy in how the medical report was received, the Principal Appellant explained that he did not understand the question when it was first asked. Following that, the question was asked again, and the Principal Appellant answered it in a manner that was consistent with his earlier testimony.\n[47] I therefore do not hold this discrepancy against the credibility of the Appellants.\n[48] I leave aside in my analysis those findings of the RPD that are interconnected with discrepancies it identified between the medical reports and the BOCs of the Appellants. Despite this, in my assessment, neither of the medical reports establish that either of the Appellants were tortured. I note that the medical report on the Associate Appellant, XXXX XXXX, is that he \"suffers from bruises and bruises in different areas of the body with general weakness. He has been given the appropriate treatments,\" while the medical report on the Principal Appellant, XXXX XXXX, states he \"suffers from a fracture of the right leg with bruising in different areas of the body with general weakness\".8 There is no evidence, including in these medical reports, that the injuries were caused by torture.\n[49] I accept that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellants sustained injuries. However, the medical reports do not enable me to conclude that the injuries were a result of torture. I therefore agree with the RPD that the reports have little probative value in establishing that the Appellants were tortured.\nThe warrant for arrest is not genuine\n[50] I agree with the RPD that the document that was provided to it by the Appellants purporting to be an arrest warrant for the Principal Appellant, XXXX XXXX, issued by the XXXX XXXX Police Directorate,9 is not genuine. Appellants' Counsel has not made any submissions about this finding of the RPD.\n[51] There is no sample in the country condition documents to indicate what the format of an arrest warrant in Jordan is. Nevertheless, in my independent assessment, I agree with the RPD that this document, which the Appellants stated is an original, is likely a copy rather than an original, because of the blurred logo at the top of the document and the fact that the stamp on the document is not legible. Furthermore, I agree with the RPD that, on a balance of probabilities, this document is not genuine because of the following issues with it:\n(a) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX full date of birth is not listed (only the year of his birth);\n(b) the first name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX mother is given to explain whom the police should arrest (but not her full names); and,\n(c) his father's name is not mentioned in the document, whereas it would be customary in Jordan to refer to him as \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX son of ....\"\n[52] In my view, the RPD was correct to find that it would be reasonable to expect that an arrest warrant would clearly indicate details of the person who is to be arrested, to distinguish them from other persons with the same name, but this document does not do that.\n[53] The Appellants have also not disputed that it is usual in Jordan to refer to an individual using his father's name, i.e., \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX son of ....\"\n[54] I therefore concur with the RPD in giving this document no weight, and I too draw a negative inference against their credibility for having presented a non-genuine document.\nCONCLUSION\n[55] The Appellant submits in paragraph 32 of the Appellants' Memorandum that the RPD ignored the totality of the documentary evidence, \"including relevant identity documentation and NDP documentation.\"10 With respect, identity was not an issue in this case, and the documentary evidence does not, in my assessment, establish their claim is true.\n[56] Although there are minor aspects of the RPD's findings with which I do not agree, the force of the multiple negative credibility findings in this case is such that I find the presumption of truthfulness that attached to the sworn testimony of the Appellants11 has been rebutted.\n[57] With all due respect to Counsel's submission on appeal about the objective evidence, while I accept the National Documentation Package (NDP) establishes that opponents of the Jordanian government are detained and can sometimes be tortured - subject to very limited steps to \"investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed abuses\"12 - the RPD's findings turn on the credibility of the Appellants. In this case the Appellants' allegations that they were arrested because of their political beliefs and were subsequently persecuted are, in my assessment, not credible. The Appellants have failed to establish their profiles as individuals who face persecution or who have been persecuted in Jordan because of their political beliefs.\n[58] In summary, I agree with the RPD that the Appellants are not credible, and that if returned to Jordan they do not face a serious possibility of persecution nor, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nDETERMINATION\n[59] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA,13 the RAD confirms the Decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention14 refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Ron Liberman\"\nRon Liberman\nFebruary 7, 2022\nDate\n1 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256, Rule 55.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, section 110(4).\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Appellant closed his operations twice, but the harassment and threats continue.\n[3] In its decision, the RPD found that the Appellant operates a very small XXXX XXXX that sells to approximately 35-40 customers whereas the two alleged agents of persecution have a customer base of over 25,000 customers. Under these circumstances, in addition to the fact that the Appellant did not complain to the police about an incident of vandalism to his delivery truck, the RPD found that the Appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subjected to a risk to life or other cruel treatment under s. 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The RPD also found that the Appellant had a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Tirana and adequate state protection.\n[4] In his Memorandum, the Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of the Appellant's credibility by ignoring evidence regarding competitors' illegal conduct and the police corruption. He also submits that the RPD failed to provide evidence that Tirana is a viable IFA.\n[5] The determinative issues for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) are credibility and procedural fairness.\nDECISION\n[6] The appeal is dismissed. The RPD's decision finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection because of his lack of credibility is correct.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The RAD reviews RPD decisions on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the record.1Having applied this standard and reviewed the record, including reading the transcript of the hearing held before the RPD on June 30, 2021, I have decided to dismiss the appeal for the following reasons.\nNo breach of procedural fairness\n[8] At the hearing, the Appellant submitted two police certificates each reporting statements by individuals about alleged threats against the Appellant's wife and family by individuals looking for the Appellant in 2018 and 2019. In its decision, the RPD found that, on a balance of probabilities, the two police documents submitted by the Appellant were not genuine because of a number of irregularities: the reports showed different letterheads and police crests, there were spelling mistakes as to the address and the phone number of the police stations whereas there was no telephone number on another report. The Appellant testified that he did not know why there were differences in the reports but added that police do make mistakes. His Counsel argued that the directors of the police station could have changed but provided no evidence to support such an argument. The RPD rejected the Appellant's explanations for lack of supporting evidence.\n[9] In his Memorandum, the Appellant submits that the RPD breached procedural fairness by not sending the police reports to Albania for authentication purposes given its concerns expressed at the hearing.\n[10] While I understand the Appellant may disagree with the RPD's findings regarding the lack of genuineness of both documents, I do not find there was any breach of procedural fairness. The RPD clearly stated at the outset of the hearing, that the issue of credibility was a determinative factor. He also stated during the hearing his concerns about both police certificates and openly contemplated at the hearing whether they should be sent back to Albania for authentication because he was not satisfied with the Appellant's answers that he found to be \"too evasive\".2 The Appellant was represented by competent legal Counsel. He was able to present his story and respond to the RPD's concerns. Based on my review of the transcript of the hearing, at no time did the RPD deny the Appellant an opportunity to provide additional information or clarify the discrepancies in the documents during the hearing. Further, the Appellant did not request an adjournment to allow him to send the reports back to Albania to have them authenticated in order to support his testimony. Finally, his legal Counsel made fulsome submissions on all of the issues identified by the RPD.\n[11] It is well established that it is up to a claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the facts on which he bases his application for refugee status.3 In the case at hand, the RPD clearly spelt out its concern about the police reports, it was up to the Appellant, not the RPD, to present the best available evidence in support of his refugee claim. Under these circumstances, I find the RPD's findings are correct and that there was no breach of procedural fairness.\nCredibility\n[12] In his Memorandum, the Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility by misconstruing or ignoring the Appellant's evidence regarding competition in the cheese production business.\n[13] The Appellant testified that he had been stopped by delivery truck drivers of two large cheese companies who told him to close his business, or they would make his family disappear. The Appellant also testified that the tires of his delivery truck were slashed and that the police had seized all the XXXX in his delivery truck and told him to stop XXXX XXXX. He explained that he did not file a complaint with the police or the Ombudsman or the Anti-corruption unit because in his opinion, they were all corrupt.\n[14] The RPD found that the Appellant was not a credible witness. It found that because the Appellant lacked a prominent business profile in Albania given his very small customer base consisting of 35-40 customers, in comparison with the large companies who sold to over 25,000 customers, he did not attract the attention of the large companies. The RPD also found that the lack of any complaint with any law-and-order institution undermined the Appellant's credibility.\n[15] In his Memorandum, the Appellant submits that drivers are paid a commission on sales and that with less competition, XXXX can be sold at a higher price.\n[16] With respect, I do not believe that the Appellant's arguments provide the necessary evidence to support his allegations.\n[17] In my view, the RPD's finding that the Appellant lacks credibility in his allegation that the two largest cheese producers in Albania which together totalled over 50,000 customers were concerned about the Appellant's production and customer base of 35-40 consisting of small grocery customers is correct. While I accept the theoretical proposition that the Appellant is making in his Memorandum that the price of a good can be influenced by the degree of competition in the marketplace, the magnitude of the two cheese producers in comparison with that of the Appellant simply does not provide the evidentiary basis to support the Appellant's argument. In my view, the RPD's finding that, absent any corroborative evidence, the Appellant's allegation that he was intimidated and forced by the two largest producers to close his business is not tenable is correct. As for the Appellant's argument that the truck drivers were motivated by the sales commission, they could make by increasing their customer base, in my view and with respect, the argument lies in the theoretical domain and is not substantiated by any evidence in this specific case. Given the huge difference in the customer base, I believe the RPD was correct in its finding that the Appellant's allegations that the truck drivers were his agents of persecution were unbelievable and thus, without merit.\n[18] In his Memorandum, the Appellant submits that the RPD ignored the fact that his friend, also a small XXXX XXXX, was beaten in April 2017. While I agree that the RPD did not mention the incident in his decision, I do not believe it to be determinative given the facts set out in this case. To begin with, the Appellant did not provide any corroborative evidence regarding the death of his friend nor the circumstances. Secondly, the Appellant alleges that his friend was also a small XXXX XXXX as he was. For the same reasons set out above, the Appellant's allegation that the two largest cheese producers in Albania with a customer base each of 25,000 are responsible for the alleged beating of his friend is not substantiated by the evidence.\n[19] In his Memorandum, the Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility by ignoring the evidence contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Albania 4 about the prevalence of police corruption which is at the basis of his decision not to file a complaint with police. Thus, he submits that he has rebutted the presumption of state protection because, while certain mechanisms to investigate and punish police abuse exist in Albania, these mechanisms are meaningless if there is a lack of will on the part of law-and-order institutions to provide protection, which he argues, is the case in Albania.\n[20] With respect, I do not concur with the Appellant's arguments. In my view, the RPD's finding that the failure by the Appellant to file a complaint with the police, the ombudsman or the anti-corruption unit undermines his credibility is correct.\n[21] The Supreme Court of Canada has held that \"Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant. Clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided\".5 The Federal Court has held that state protection in Albania must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and that the facts are different in each case. For my part, I am of the view that the Appellant has not demonstrated that he exhausted all possible avenues of state protection before seeking surrogate protection or that he took all means to seek state protection and that it was refused. While documentary evidence shows that some corruption exists in Albania, there has not been a complete breakdown of the state apparatus and the Appellant has not provided clear and convincing evidence that he cannot avail himself of state protection.\n[22] It is not sufficient for claimants to provide documentary evidence about problematic situations in their country to be recognized as Convention refugees. They must also demonstrate a connection between that evidence and their personal situation, which the Appellant failed to do in this case by deliberately choosing not to seek any assistance from the police and other authorities.6\nIFA\n[23] At the hearing, the RPD identified Tirana as a possible IFA. In his Memorandum, the Appellant submits that Tirana is not a viable IFA. He argues that the RPD failed to provide evidence as to why the situation in Tirana is any different from elsewhere in the country and failed to explain how the Appellant would be any safer in Tirana. He also referred to the beating of his friend, another small XXXX XXXX, as evidence that Tirana is not viable.\nLegal test for IFA\n[24] The test for an IFA is two-pronged. Once the IFA has been raised by the RPD, the onus of proof is on the refugee claimant to establish that: 1) on a balance of probabilities, there is a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the suggested IFA locations; and 2) it is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh, in all of the circumstances, for the claimant to move to the suggested IFA location.7\nNo risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in proposed IFA\n[25] In the case at hand, the onus is on the Appellant not the RPD as he argues in his Memorandum, to establish that the proposed IFA is not viable. The Appellant testified that Tirana is just like any other city in Albania and that he would not be safe but did not provide any evidence to support his statement. That is not sufficient. In its decision, the RPD pointed out that since 2016, there have been no incidents against the Appellant and his family other than the slashed tires, for which, given the lack of corroborative evidence, the RPD attributed to general criminality and not the actions of the alleged agents of persecution. For my part, I find that the RPD was correct in concluding that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant has not sufficiently proven that the agents of harm, who remain unknown, have the motivation or the means to seek out and target the Appellant and his family in Tirana. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant had not established that there is a serious risk of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA in Tirana.\nIt is not unreasonable or unduly harsh for the Appellant to move to the proposed IFA\n[26] The Federal Court of Appeal set a very high threshold for what makes an IFA unreasonable: \"It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions\".8\n[27] Based on the evidence in the record, both the Appellant and his wife are well educated, and the Appellant, an experienced businessman having opened a second business. The Appellant did not provide any evidence that it would be unduly harsh or unreasonable for him and his family to relocate to Tirana.\n[28] I have reviewed the evidence and I do not find that the RPD erred. I do not find that there is sufficient evidence to support the Appellant's argument that Tirana is not a viable IFA.\n[29] I find that there is not a serious possibility of persecution should the Appellant return to Albania. Based on my independent assessment of the record, I find that the Appellant has failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA and, for these same reasons, I find that the Appellant is not a person in need of protection or at a risk to life, or at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or in danger of torture as set out in section 97 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] I confirm that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Tirana.\n[31] Pursuant to section 111 (1) (a) of the IRPA, I confirm the decision of the RPD that XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under section 96 and 97 of the IRPA.\n[32] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nNicole Ladouceur\nNicole Ladouceur\nFebruary 14, 2022\nDate\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of Mexico.\n[2] The Appellant worked XXXX XXXX XXXX with his father in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He received a call from a man he believes was associated with Los Zetas demanding that he work with them to steal gasoline as there was a gas pipeline running through XXXX XXXX. When he refused, the Appellant was threatened. He moved to the state of XXXX with his wife and child. The Appellant's wife was abducted in XXXX 2016 while out shopping. The Appellant and his daughter stayed with his sister in Toluca and received a phone call threatening him to pay XXXX XXXX pesos if he wanted to see his wife again. The Appellant could not raise the money, so he sent his daughter to live with his parents and made two unsuccessful attempts to cross into the U.S. In early 2017, the Appellant returned home, where he worked until he was able to fly to Canada in XXXX 2018.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that credibility and an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur were determinative. The Appellant lacked subjective fear for returning to his home for 18 months and for the nine-month delay in seeking protection in Canada. A letter from the Appellant's sister was given no weight as it was not translated. The Appellant's testimony that the agents of harm (AOH) are Los Zetas is speculative, and the AOH's interest in the Appellant was related to his proximity to a gas pipeline. Even if the AOH were Los Zetas, they have no presence in the proposed IFA and are now split into warring factions.\n[4] The Appellant argues that the RPD's credibility findings are not supported by the totality of testimony. He argues that the RPD erred by finding his testimony about Los Zetas was speculative and that the RPD failed to consider a translation of the letter from the Appellant's sister. The Appellant further argues that the RPD misstated the test for an IFA and that the IFA is objectively unreasonable because the IFA is unsafe, and because of the impact of the Appellant's emotional trauma and the lack of childcare for his daughter.\n[5] The determinative issues are credibility and IFA.\n[6] The RPD did err in failing to consider the translation of the letter from the Appellant's sister and misstated the test for the first prong of the IFA test; however, these errors were not significant. The RPD did not err in finding that the Appellant's testimony that the Los Zetas are the AOH is speculative or in finding that the IFA is viable.\nDECISION\n[7] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[8] The Appellant provided two written statements regarding new evidence he is submitting in this appeal. In the first statement, the Appellant indicates he is submitting a Written Statement.1 In a second written statement, the Appellant indicates he is submitting new evidence which arose after the RPD's decision or could not have been anticipated because there was no notice of the proposed IFA locations prior to the hearing; however, he does not indicate what the new evidence is.2 In addition, in her memorandum, Counsel requests that the translation of the Appellant's sister's letter also be admitted as new evidence.3\n[9] Since the translation of the Appellant's sister's letter is already in the RPD record, it is not new evidence. Having reviewed the Appellant's record, I find the only new document submitted is the Appellant's written statement.\nThe evidence presented by the Appellant is rejected\n[10] According to the Law,4 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD's decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the Appellant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[11] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.5\n[12] The Appellant's written statement is signed XXXX XXXX, 2021.6 The statement includes all of the content of the Appellant's amended narrative.7 In addition, it contains statements about:\n(1) why the Appellant did not claim protection right away in Canada;\n(2) that he paid LC and his mother XXXX XXXX to write out his narrative;\n(3) that he decided to submit an addendum to his original narrative, including only the truth about what he has experienced;\n(4) how cartels consider fleeing an act of defiance and Los Zetas can still send one of their members to kill him in another area;\n(5) his wife's mother contracting COVID-10, which also prevented her from trying to get his wife's death certificate; and\n(6) having XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, trouble remembering dates and details and nightmares about his missing wife.\n[13] The Appellant has provided no submissions as to how the statement meets the requirements described above as required by Rule 3(3)(g)(iii).8 The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) Rules are clear that full and detailed submissions must set out how any proposed new evidence meets the admissibility requirements and how that evidence relates to the Appellant.9 Nonetheless, I have reviewed the Appellant's record and considered the available information in my assessment.\n[14] The content that is identical to the Appellant's amended narrative is already in the RPD record. Some of the additional statements are attempts to summarize the Appellant's testimony or provide new evidence; the remainder are submissions about issues in the Appellant's claim. None of the statement contains any information that was not already before the RPD or that could not have been reasonably provided to the RPD, nor does the information concern events that arose after the RPD's decision. The Federal Court has made clear that submitting evidence under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) is not an opportunity to correct a deficient record nor is it to be used as a vehicle to advocate for the Appellant. The statement is not admitted as new evidence.\nRequest for an oral hearing is denied\n[15] The Appellant provided two different statements requesting an oral hearing. In one statement, the Appellant indicates that he is requesting a new hearing \"given the procedural fairness issues\"10 and in the other, if I find that credibility is an issue in this appeal.11\n[16] Since I have not admitted any new evidence, I do not have jurisdiction to hold an oral hearing. The Appellant's requests for an oral hearing are denied.\nANALYSIS\n[17] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.12\nUndisputed findings\n[18] The Appellant has not challenged the following RPD findings:\n(1) The Appellant's return to XXXX XXXX XXXX for 18 months seriously undermines his subjective fear, and his testimony surrounding it seriously undermines his overall credibility;13 and\n(2) The Appellant did not provide any persuasive evidence that he had attempted to obtain corroborative documents, which undermines his overall credibility and allegations of harm in Mexico.14\n[19] I have reviewed the RPD record and the hearing transcript and find no error in these findings.\nAppellant's testimony that Los Zetas are the agents of harm is speculative\n[20] The Appellant argues that objective evidence demonstrates that Los Zetas steal fuel in Veracruz; therefore, the RPD's finding that the Appellant's testimony was speculative is unreasonable. I disagree.\n[21] I agree with the Appellant that objective documentation indicates that fuel theft is rampant in Mexico at large, that Veracruz is one of the top fuel theft states and that Los Zetas engage in fuel theft. I note, however, that country documentation in the National Documentation Package (NDP) indicates that Los Zetas are fragmented and do not control the state of Veracruz. Sources indicate that the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n is the dominant cartel in Veracruz.15 In addition, sources indicate that fuel theft is also carried out by local criminal groups, some of whom adopt the Zeta name to get the benefit of Los Zetas reputation.16 That fuel theft is carried out by cartels and criminal gangs is acknowledged in an article submitted by the Appellant, which states that: \"Cartels like Los Zetas and the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel, as well as smaller community gangs, have been stealing resources from PEMEX, the Mexican state-owned petroleum company, for decades.\"17 In my view, country documentation does not corroborate that fuel theft is only carried out by Los Zetas in Veracruz. The RPD's finding that the Appellant's testimony that the agents of harm are Los Zetas is speculative is not in error. I concur with the RPD's conclusion that the evidence suggests that the agents of harm are criminals operating in the Appellant's home area in Viejon Nuevo.\nRPD failed to consider translation of Appellant's sister's letter\n[22] The RPD gave no weight to a letter from the Appellant's sister, AVR, because it was not translated. This is a clear error, as the Appellant submitted a translation of the letter to the RPD on May 3, 2021, which is well before the RPD's decision on August 5, 2021.\n[23] I have reviewed the translation of the letter and note that AVR states that the Appellant and his daughter stayed with her in the year 2016 in Toluca, Mexico:\nFrom there, he left my house and moved to Neuvo Laredo. The girl, [the Appellant's daughter], stayed with me for a few days. My brother said he took her to our mother's place in XXXX, Municipality of XXXX XXXX.18\n[24] The original letter is signed and accompanied by a photocopy of AVR's voter identification card, which provides her birth date and corresponds with the information given by the Appellant in his amended basis of claim.19 The letter corroborates the Appellant's narrative and testimony that he and his daughter stayed with AVR after they left XXXX, XXXX in 2016. I also note that the letter directly contradicts the Appellant's narrative20 and testimony21 that AVR took his daughter to XXXX XXXX because he knew that, if he returned to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the criminals would be waiting for him.22 I draw a negative inference as to the Appellant's credibility on this basis.\nThe Appellant has a viable internal flight alternative in Cabos San Lucas\nFirst prong\n[25] I agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred in articulating the first prong of the test for determining whether there is a viable IFA by stating that \"[the Appellant] bears the burden of proof to show that there is a reasonable chance that persecution will occur in the entire country and specifically in the proposed IFA.\"23 The law is clear that the first prong of the test involves an assessment of whether there is a risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, on a balance of probabilities, in the proposed IFA. I do not, however, find that the RPD's analysis of the first prong was based on the inaccurate statement and therefore is not in error.\nSecond prong\n[26] The Appellant argues that the proposed IFA is objectively unreasonable because there is a specific lack of safety in Cabos San Lucas based on the high level of crime and lack of state protection. I disagree.\n[27] As the RPD did, I acknowledge that criminality is a widespread problem in Mexico. A review of the most recent country documentation indicates that Baja California Sur continues to experience high levels of extortion.24 Sources do indicate that there is a decrease in violence in the state because the CJNG have total control.25 The Organized Crime and Violence in Mexico: 2020 Special Report states that Baja California Sur is among the states with the lowest homicide rates,26 and in the first half of 2020, the state reported no kidnappings.27 Several sources indicate that the violence in Baja California Sur is mostly directed at individuals in the drug trade.28\n[28] Considering this objective documentation, I find that the risk of violence is generalized in Cabo San Lucas and the state of Baja California Sur, and it is lower than violence in many other Mexican states.\n[29] I am not persuaded by the Appellant's argument that there is no state protection in the proposed IFA. Whether there is adequate state protection is considered in the context of the allegations of harm, not from a general viewpoint. This question has been answered in the first-prong analysis.\n[30] In addition, the Appellant argues that the proposed IFA is objectively unreasonable because of the emotional and psychological trauma he has suffered in relation to his wife's disappearance. While it is apparent that the experience of having a loved one disappear would be extremely difficult, there is no evidence in the RPD record or the hearing transcript indicating that the Appellant has emotional and psychological trauma. The Appellant, himself, did not offer testimony about his emotional well-being and how it might impact him in the proposed IFA. The argument fails for a lack of evidence.\n[31] Finally, the Appellant argues that the IFA is objectively unreasonable because of a lack of childcare for his daughter. The Appellant did identify in his narrative that, if he returned to Mexico:\nI would be forced to find daycare for XXXX, which would be a further financial burden for me as a single father. This employment situation would tremendously hinder my family's wellbeing - particularly that of XXXX.29\nThe Appellant also testified that he would need to have daycare for his daughter and did not know if there were afterschool programs in the proposed IFA.30 I note, however, that the Appellant has not pointed to any objective documentation with respect to the availability of childcare or afterschool programs or related economic support in the proposed IFA.\n[32] My review of the country documentation indicates that the government provides financial subsidies for daycare to single parents who are working or going to school.31 The government also provides a school allowance through the Benito Ju\u00e1rez Scholarship Program, which consists of a monthly payment of 800 MXN per month to low-income families with children under the age of 18.32 Given that there is objective documentation indicating that there is some financial support for children attending school, I do not find that the proposed IFA is objectively unreasonable. I agree with the RPD that the proposed IFA is objectively reasonable considering the Appellant's personal circumstances.\nAdditional arguments made by the Appellant\n[33] The remaining arguments made by the Appellant are of an extremely general nature. The Appellant submits that listening to the audio recording of the RPD hearing will show that the RPD's credibility findings are not supported by the totality of testimony. While the Appellant did identify errors in paragraphs 9, 14-15, 19-20, 23, 25-26, 28-50 of the RPD's reasons and decision and also identified errors at 00:16-00:17; 00:29-00:38; 00:40-00:49; 00:52-01:04; 01:22-01:30; and 01:52-02:03 in the audio recording, the Appellant's memorandum fails to make any specific submissions as to what the errors are and why they are errors. The Appellant also argues that the RPD misapprehended evidence, was overly vigilant in conducting a microscopic analysis, displayed a zeal to find inconsistencies, focused on peripheral matters and failed to consider all relevant testimony. Again, the Appellant has provided no submissions as to which findings are in error or why.\n[34] The Appellant has failed to provide full and detailed submissions explaining how the RPD erred as required by RAD rule 3(3)(g). The Federal Court has made clear that:\nit is the responsibility of the appellant, not the RAD, to establish that the RPD erred in a way that justifies the RAD's intervention. It is not the RAD's function to supplement the weaknesses of an appeal (Ghauri at para 33, citing Dhillon v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 321 at paras 18-20 and Huruglica at para 103). Justice Gleeson concluded that \"appellants before the RAD that fail to specify where and how the RPD erred do so at their own peril\".33\n[35] I have, nonetheless, conducted an independent assessment and find no errors in the following RPD findings:\n(a) The Appellant's testimony about receiving a call while he was in Toluca was confusing;\n(b) The Appellant's nine-month delay in seeking asylum in Canada is not reasonably explained and is inconsistent with the Appellant's alleged fear;\n(c) The Appellant's testimony that his wife is dead is inconsistent with his narrative, in which he states she is missing;\n(d) Based on the Appellant's testimony, the AOH's interest in him is because he worked XXXX XXXX XXXX that had oil pipelines;\n(e) The Appellant does not have a profile that would lead to him being targeted personally, in the proposed IFA; rather, the evidence shows that the Appellant has been victimized by criminal elements; and\n(f) Los Zetas are now composed of a series of unconnected violent splinter groups, which reduces their ability to pursue him, and they have no presence in Cabos San Lucas.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] Considering all of the above findings, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant does not face a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment if he were to return to Mexico.\n[37] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nKaren McGovern\nKaren McGovern\nJanuary 17, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, at p. 1.\n2 Ibid., at p. 3.\n3 Exhibit P-2, Appellant Record, at p. 67.\n4 IRPA, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, subsection 110(4).\n5 M.C.I. v.

The Associate Appellant, XXXX XXXX, is her 11-year-old daughter. Both are citizens of China and no other country. At the PA's request, the Associate Appellant is represented by an independent Designated Representative (DR) before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).\n[3] If she returns, the PA claims to fear harm owing to China's family planning policy as she already has three children, but also, she fears individuals affiliated with a criminal network who previously threatened her and her children in an attempt to coerce her into making pornography. She additionally fears discrimination from community members owing to her diverse sexual orientation as a woman who prefers to be with women. She fears her children would face discrimination or harm for these reasons.\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Appellants were generally credible but that the evidence was insufficient to establish a forward-looking risk of persecution on account of the PA's diverse sexual orientation or of family-planning policy in China. It also found that any risk from the criminal network who previously threatened her could be mitigated by her relocation, and that she had a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in the cities of Harbin or Jinan.1\n[5] These RPD findings are all contested on appeal and additional arguments have also been put forward regarding the representation of the PA's American-born child who is not a subject in this appeal.2\n[6] I find that the determinative issue before the RAD relates to the PA's cumulative profile and her forward-looking risk on that basis. I will explain below why I find that the RPD erred in its\n1 Pi\u00e8ce SPR-1, RPD Record, RPD Reasons, paras. 9-50.\n2 Pi\u00e8ce P-2, Appellants' Record, Appellants' Memorandum, pp. 29-44.\nassessment of the PA's forward-looking risk with regard to her diverse sexual orientation and, ultimately, came to the wrong conclusion regarding both Appellants who are subjects of this appeal. I will also explain why I find that the arguments relating to the PA's American-born daughter moot.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n[7] The role of the RAD is to intervene when the RPD is wrong in law, in fact, or in fact and law. Despite the Appellant's reference to the standard of reasonableness, I reviewed the decision of the RPD by applying the correctness standard.3\n[8] The RPD determined the claim on the issues of the forward-looking risk of harm and the existence of a viable IFA for the Appellants. In their Appeal Record, the Appellants argue that these RPD findings are incorrect, that they would not be safe anywhere in China. In my view, each of the determinative issues in the appeal before me has been raised in the Appeal Record.\nANALYSIS\n[9] On my own assessment, I find that the RPD incorrectly assessed the forward-looking risk to the Appellants owing to the PA's sexual orientation and cumulative profile (see below - i.). I have examined the totality of the evidence, including country conditions, and consider that there is more than sufficient and credible evidence on the record to support that the Appellants will face a serious possibility of persecution if they return to anywhere in China. Therefore, the RAD can bring finality to the claim (see below - ii.). For this reason, I have not examined the other RPD conclusions or arguments put forth relating to the PA's American-born daughter, and I will briefly address why they are moot and\/or beyond the scope of this appeal (see below - iii.).\n[10] The Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC Guidelines)4 were taken into\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93, [2016] 4 FCR 157; Rozas del Solar v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1145, [2019] 2 FCR 597.\n4 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC Guidelines), revised: December 17, 2021.\naccount when considering the process of the hearing, the facts in this case, and in examining whether the RPD erred in its conclusions.\n[11] The Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Gender Guidelines),5 were also considered. All relevant factors, such as the social and cultural context in which the Appellants found themselves, were examined with consideration of these Guidelines.\n[12] The Chairperson's Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues (Child Guidelines)6 were also considered with respect to the Associate Appellant. Relevant factors, such as her age and level of maturity, were examined.\n[13] The following analysis applies equally to both Appellants.\ni. The RPD Incorrectly Assessed the Forward-Looking Risk to the Appellants\na) The RPD did not sufficiently assess all aspects of the PA's intersectional profile\n[14] The RPD considered that the Appellants had not established that the risk they face upon return to China would amount to persecution, even if taken cumulatively. It also found that any risk that might remain from the PA's past experiences could be mitigated by their relocation to the cities of Harbin or Jinan.\n[15] It is argued that the RPD erred by ignoring the evidence that without any social network or social assistance for the PA and her three young children, no viable IFA would be available to them. I agree with this, and I will explain why.\n5 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Gender Guidelines), effective 13 November 1996.\n6 IRB, Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues [Child Guidelines], effective September 30, 1996.\n[16] The RPD found that the PA was generally credible and accepted that she had established all material elements of her claim. On my own assessment, I also find the same. The PA gave detailed, personalised, spontaneous and generally credible testimony.\n[17] The undisputed facts are therefore that she is a single mother of three children with a XXXX XXXX level of education who is separated from her spouse and who previously faced emotional abuse.7 She underwent a forced abortion without her consent or knowledge.8 She was threatened to coerce her into making pornography.9 She has no effective family or community support left in China given that her father is deceased, her mother disabled, and her in-laws were emotionally abusive.10 11 Her friends were involved in attempts to coerce her into making pornography.12\n[18] In addition, the PA stated very unambiguously that she identifies as a woman with a diverse sexual orientation who prefers women and fears discrimination, stigma and ostracism towards her and her children on that basis if this fact was revealed to community members.13\n[19] In my opinion, the RPD failed to sufficiently consider the cumulative and intersectional impact of all of these factors, which form part of her profile, to assess the forward-looking risk to her, and by extension her daughter, if they were to return to China today. I find that this profile, including the PA's lack of a support network and her intrinsic vulnerability because of all these elements would not be altered or ameliorated in an IFA location even if the individuals who previously inflicted harm and threats were far away.\n[20] As noted in the SOGIESC Guidelines, individuals with diverse SOGIESC may face additional risks because of their gender, including domestic violence, sexual trafficking, as well as discrimination with respect to housing, employment, education, health and social services.14\n7 Pi\u00e8ce SPR-1, RPD Record, BOC Narrative, pp. 22-24.\n8 Ibid.\n9 Ibid.\n10 Ibid.\n11 Transcript of RPD Hearing, August 4, 2021, p. 11\n12 Transcript of RPD Hearing, April 14, 2021, pp. 14-15.\n13 Transcript of RPD Hearing, August 4, 2021, p. 10.\n14 SOGIESC Guidelines, Section 8.5.2 Intersectionality\nMoreover, it is well-established that an IFA is not viable if a SOGIESC individual must conceal their SOGIESC in order to live in that location.15 16\n[21] Turning to the present case, the country evidence shows that despite progress in some major cities, this progress is \"precarious\", and discrimination and state repression of individuals with diverse SOGIESC are still pervasive throughout China.17 18 19 Discrimination, harassment, and violence exist and are prevalent in the workplace and school, by families and by authorities, and no laws expressly provide protection. Women are said to be particularly vulnerable to such discrimination and violence.20 Access to health and social services remains difficult when one's sexual orientation or gender diversity is known to, or even just suspected by, service providers.21 Research also demonstrates that this discrimination and social stigma results in substantially higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide for such individuals.22\n[22] This is especially relevant to the PA's particular circumstances given her testimony that she did not feel safe anywhere in China and previously almost committed suicide because of what she had endured; she stated that she wanted to \"jump into the river to die.\"23\n15 Ibid., Section 8.7 Internal flight alternative (IFA)\n16 Okoli v.

Darius Longarino. 16 December 2020, p. 7.\n23 Transcript of RPD Hearing, August 4, 2021, p. 11, line 5.\n[23] It seems to me that the RPD failed to give sufficient consideration to the evidence indicating the PA's vulnerability and the risks to her mental health and overall well-being if she returns today, especially that, in addition to the above, she will find herself a single mother with no support and required to care for her children on her own while facing pervasive stigma and cumulative discrimination in various spheres of life.\n[24] This would certainly be hard in any country, but I find that given the PA's past experiences, limited education, and overall profile, she would be particularly vulnerable to further harm, exploitation-including sexual exploitation and abuse given the previous attempts to coerce her into pornography-if she was forced to return to China without any support.\n[25] Indeed, country evidence reports that China is recognized as an important source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labour and sexual exploitation. It continues to be classified as a Tier 3 country (the lowest tier) by the United States State Department Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.24 A significant number of Chinese women and children are trafficked internally. Hotspots for trafficking include the province of Heilongjiang-where the proposed IFA location of Harbin is situated.25 The forcible or deceptive recruitment of women and children for the purposes of forced prostitution or sexual exploitation is a form of gender-related violence, which may constitute persecution.26\n[26] As mentioned above, this risk is compounded by the discrimination in various spheres of life, ostracism, and possible violence she would face as a person with a diverse sexual orientation in her workplace and within her community. The PA is not a highly educated woman as she only has a XXXX XXXX education and previously worked an XXXX job and currently works as a XXXX which further limits her employment opportunities and compounds her vulnerability to\n24 Pi\u00e8ce SAR-1, NDP, China, 5 November 2021, tab 7.3: China: Tier 3.

It is noteworthy that she gave credible testimony about the emotional abuse she endured from her in-laws who remain in China, as this limits her childcare and housing options significantly. I will also explain later that all this would necessarily impact her young daughter, the Associate Appellant, who would face a similar risk as a result (see below: b)).\n[27] In concurrence with the Gender Guidelines, in my assessment of the harm feared by the Appellants, I have considered their particular circumstances, including the PA's past psychological distress and trauma. I also note the UNHCR guidance according to which:\nThe subjective character of fear of persecution requires an evaluation of the opinions and feelings of the person concerned. It is also in the light of such opinions and feelings that any actual or anticipated measures against [them] must necessarily be viewed. Due to variations in the psychological make-up of individuals and in the circumstances of each case, interpretations of what amounts to persecution are bound to vary.27\n[28] Considering the susceptibilities of the PA, including her previous emotional and physical abuse and lack of any support network upon return, I find that the cumulative discrimination and harassment in various spheres of life, violence and risk of exploitation she would face due to her particular vulnerability as a single mother with a diverse SOGIESC who has no effective family or community support creates a serious possibility of persecution for her if she returns to anywhere in China today given that the evidence shows that the above situation exists throughout China.\nb) The risk that extends to the Associate Appellant amounts to persecution\n[29] Similarly, regarding the Associate Appellant, I find that although it is not established that she would be perceived as having a diverse SOGIESC by extension of her mother, the cumulative and pervasive discrimination they would face as a family and the harm that would be inflicted upon her mother by community members and\/or their in-laws if they returned to live with them would necessarily have an impact on her and likely result in similar cumulative and pervasive\n27 UNHCR Handbook, p. 21.\ndiscrimination and stigma upon her. It is well recognised, for example, that a child who is made to witness physical and psychological domestic abuse is a victim of abuse.28\n[30] Further, I note the UNHCR guidance that in the case of a child applicant, psychological harm may be a particularly relevant factor to consider. Children are more likely to be distressed by hostile situations, to believe improbable threats, or to be emotionally affected by unfamiliar circumstances. Memories of traumatic events may linger in a child and put them at heightened risk of future harm. Children are also more sensitive to acts that target close relatives. Harm inflicted against members of the child's family can support a well-founded fear in the child.29\n[31] This is in line with the Child Guidelines from this Board and case-law generally confirming that the particular vulnerabilities of children should be considered when assessing whether certain acts or situations would amount to \"persecution\" of a child, in line with Canada's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.30 31\n[32] Given this, I find that there is a serious possibility that the Associate Appellant would witness and\/or experience harm as a result of her mother's precarious situation and owing to the cumulative and pervasive discrimination and stigma for individuals with diverse SOGIESC in China. I find that this would amount to persecution owing to her young age and in the absence of any other caretaker upon return.\n[33] In sum, I conclude that both Appellants would face a forward-looking risk of persecution owing to the PA's status as a single mother and woman of diverse SOGIESC without effective family or community support who would be vulnerable to further abuse and exploitation given her past experiences.\n28 Modeste v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 1262 (CanLII), para. 32.\n29 UNHCR Handbook, p. 150.\n30 IRB, Child Guidelines, Introduction.\n31 Kim v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 149 (CanLII), paras. 57-61.\nii. The RAD Can Bring Finality to the Claim\n[34] Having found that the RPD erred in its conclusion, I must decide on a remedy, and if possible, bring finality to the claim.\na) The forward-looking risk to the Appellants is established\n[35] I have already explained above why I find that the Appellants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout China if they return owing to the PA's profile as a single mother of three and woman of diverse SOGIESC without effective family or community support who would be vulnerable to further abuse and exploitation given her past experiences.\nb) State protection would not be forthcoming\n[36] It is trite law that the state's willingness to act must be considered as well as its ability to provide effective protection at an operational level.32 I find that adequate state protection would not be available to the Appellants at an operational level, based on the country evidence.\n[37] The Gender Guidelines also ask decision-makers to consider evidence indicating a failure of state protection if the state or its agents in the country of origin are unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection from gender-related persecution.33 Similarly, the SOGIESC Guidelines recommend that in considering whether state protection is available to a SOGIESC individual, a fact-based analysis of the operational adequacy and effectiveness of state protection in the country of reference should be made and note that it is important to consider that SOGIESC individuals may\n32 Budai v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 313 (CanLII), para. 21: \"It is well established that the test for state protection requires operational adequacy: Canada (Attorney General) v Ward, 1993 CanLII 105 (SCC), [1993] 2 SCR 689; Flores Carrillo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FCA 94 at para 30. The focus should be on evidence of actual or operational protection as an empirical reality-efforts to address the problem, a state's willingness to improve, or steps being taken that some day may result in adequate state protection are not determinative of the adequacy of state protection: Beri v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 854 at paras 36-37; Kovacs v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 1003 at para 66; Burai v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 565 at para 28. Although not a standard of perfection, adequate state protection requires more than \"making serious efforts\" to address issues and protect citizens: Garcia v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 79 at para 15.\" [emphasis added].\n33 Gender Guidelines, see: C. Evidentiary Matters.\nface differential protection or uneven access to state protection based on additional factors including their social class and education.34\n[38] The PA has hidden her sexual orientation in most aspects of her life and has not been targeted on that basis in the past. However, the evidence suggests that SOGIESC individuals have been victims of violence, extortion, and rape, but they are often afraid or ashamed to report such crimes to law enforcement officials due to the fear of ridicule and discrimination, and there are no laws that protect SOGIESC individuals from discrimination in employment, health and access to social services more generally.35\n[39] Additionally, as mentioned, the United States State Department has listed China as a Tier 3 country in terms of human trafficking since 2017, the lowest designation reserved for governments that \"do not fully meet the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts to do so.\"36\n[40] For these reasons, I find that the objective evidence establishes that Chinese authorities are ineffective in protecting SOGIESC individuals as well as vulnerable women at risk of exploitation and trafficking such as the Appellants. The evidence sets out that although China is still a functioning state, there is a lack of willingness to adequately protect individuals with diverse SOGIESC and, in some cases, authorities are complicit in persecuting them. I find that the evidence on the record is sufficient to establish clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to the Appellants anywhere in China.\n[41] In these circumstances, neither state protection nor an internal flight alternative (IFA) is available to the Appellants if they were to return given that the situation is countrywide.\n34 SOGIESC Guidelines, see: 8.6 State Protection.\n35 Pi\u00e8ce SAR-1, NDP, China, 5 November 2021, tab 6.3: Being LGBT in Asia: China Country Report.

Other Arguments by Counsel Are Moot and Beyond the Scope of this Appeal\n[42] Finally, Counsel for the PA has made several arguments pertaining to the (mis)representation of her American-born daughter, XXXX, who had a separate DR before the RPD and who is not a subject of this appeal. Counsel has included with the PA's memorandum a \"Notice of Constitutional Question\" to argue that had XXXX been adequately represented by her DR and a legal counsel been appointed for her, the evidence in her claim would have likely been relevant and pertinent for the PA's claim. It is argued that this had a serious deleterious effect on the PA's claim.\n[43] I do not find these arguments persuasive given that her claim entirely relied on her mother's and there is no evidence or argument on the record, including in the memorandum tendered for the PA on appeal, of a forward-looking risk to the PA's American-born daughter if she returned to the United States where she holds nationality, and it is trite law that a well-founded fear of persecution in all countries of nationality has to be established for a refugee claim to be successful.37\n[44] Counsel has therefore not established that any real or perceived issues in representation before the RPD had an impact on the outcome of the PA's claim. I would also note here that Counsel has not appropriately followed RAD Rule 25 pertaining to the notification of constitutional questions in raising this issue which includes, for example, giving notice to the Attorney General of Canada.38\n[45] Given the above and given that Counsel has no authority to act on behalf of the PA's American-born daughter since she is not a subject of this appeal and the PA has repeatedly confirmed her unwillingness to act as DR for this child, I will not consider these arguments here as they are beyond the scope of the present appeal relating only to the two above Appellants.\n[46] As an aside, I would note that while in Canadian law the principle of family unity is not considered at the time of refugee status determination,39 it is considered that it has been incorporated into the law by different means, most commonly, by allowing the inclusion of family members in\n37 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 379 (CanLII), para. 13.\nthe permanent residency application of the person who has been granted refugee status, if eligible.40 This may be the case for the PA's American-born daughter now that the PA will be granted refugee status and I find that Counsel's arguments may well be moot accordingly.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] Based on the above, I conclude that the PA's sexual orientation and profile will place the Appellants at risk if they return to China, and that they would face a serious possibility of persecution in the form of cumulative and pervasive discrimination, ostracism, exploitation, abuse, and violence, as outlined above, on account of their membership in particular social group (individuals with diverse SOGIESC\/women with no effective family or community protection).\n[48] In sum, I consider that the Appellants have established a forward-looking risk, that adequate state protection is not available to them, and that no viable IFA exists.\nDECISION\n[49] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention Refugees.\n(signed)\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nApril 22, 2022\nDate\nDO\/in\n40 Ibid., para. 14: \"A person who has obtained refugee status may include family members in their application for permanent residence: Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR\/2002-227, sections 1(3), 2 and 176.

They are appealing a Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision that denied their claims for refugee protection in Canada.\n[2] The Appellants fear persecution from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a politician in Mexico who they allege is corrupt. The Principal Appellant alleges that he was working for XXXX but resigned in XXXX 2019 after he reported to police the corrupt practices in XXXX camp. The Appellants allege that after the corruption was reported in the news, the Principal Appellant was threatened. The Appellants came to Canada for protection in XXXX 2019, after the Principal Appellant learned that another of XXXX employees that had resigned was reported missing.\n[3] The RPD decided that the Appellants have an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) - a location in Mexico that is safe and reasonable for them to relocate to - in Merida, Yucatan. As such, the RPD dismissed the Appellants' claims for refugee protection in Canada.\n[4] The Appellants argue that the RPD hearing was procedurally unfair. They have also submitted twenty-three items of new evidence that they want me to consider for this appeal, including news articles and letters from the Principal Appellant, a non-profit organization and family physicians. They have requested an oral hearing. With respect to the merits of the RPD Decision, they submit that the RPD erred in various ways, including failing to appreciate the nature of the risk faced by the Appellants, and by finding that the Appellants have an IFA.\n[5] It is my decision that the Appellants have not established that the RPD hearing was procedurally unfair. I have admitted the various news articles as new evidence, but I have not admitted the letters as new evidence as they contain information that could have been provided before the RPD Decision was issued. I have denied the Appellants' request for an oral hearing as\nthe criteria necessary to order an oral hearing have not been met. I have determined that the RPD correctly decided that the Appellants are not entitled to refugee protection as they have an IFA in Merida.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention1 refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Appellants' Allegations\n[7] The following paragraphs summarize the Principal Appellant's narrative to his Basis of Claim (BOC) form, and do not necessarily represent my findings of fact.\n[8] The Appellants lived in Tepic, in the state of Nayarit, Mexico.\n[9] The Principal Appellant played in a XXXX XXXX from 2002 to 2007. In XXXX 2009, the Principal Appellant began working as a XXXX for a local XXXX XXXX. In XXXX 2011, he became a XXXX at an international Mexican XXXX XXXX. He was the XXXX for and became friends with XXXX, who was a XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX.\n[10] As the Principal Appellant and XXXX traveled around Nayarit, they saw the problems of regular people and dreamt of XXXX becoming a XXXX for Tepic. He was elected as a XXXX XXXX for Tepic in XXXX 2014.\n[11] In XXXX 2015, XXXX hired the Principal Appellant as XXXXof XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as XXXX XXXX to improve public services in XXXX ward.\n[12] The Principal Appellant took a two month leave of absence to work as the XXXX XXXX on Governor Garcia's campaign, and Governor Garcia was elected on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. The Principal Appellant was invited to join Governor Garcia's staff, working in XXXX XXXX and XXXX in the state of Nayarit.\n[13] The Principal Appellant began working as XXXX of the Department for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of Nayarit State on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017.\n[14] Governor Garcia hired XXXX as an XXXX XXXX, but effectively put him in charge of XXXX XXXX.\n[15] The Principal Appellant noticed a change in XXXX after XXXX met the XXXX of one of the bases, and hired three new men. By XXXX 2018, the Principal Appellant was aware of many corrupt practices XXXX was engaging in with the three men. Examples included the sale and distribution of water tanks to hotels, restaurants, gas stations, tourist's private homes, all using the human resources and materials of the state government. The Principal Appellant alleges that they also extorted hotels and all kinds of businesses, conducting inspections and using their power to make the businesses buy fire extinguishers and other security products like emergency signs.\n[16] One of the three men that XXXX had hired had a brother who was the XXXX of the XXXX faction of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).\n[17] Around XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the Principal Appellant had enough of the corruption, and he made an appointment with the Secretary of Public Security for the State of Nayarit, who is the head of police. The Principal Appellant supported his complaint with photographs. The Principal Appellant did not receive a satisfactory response and he decided that the meeting had been pointless.\n[18] After his meeting with the Secretary, the Principal Appellant decided to resign from his job on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, as he did not want to be involved in illegal or corrupt behaviour. He tried to meet with the Governor and his private secretary, but they did not respond.\n[19] The Principal Appellant worked for his family's XXXX XXXX company during the last week of XXXX 2019.\n[20] He also reached out to a journalist friend and told him everything. The journalist relayed the information to one or two other journalists who were not financially influenced by the government, and those journalists began to investigate and make public statements providing evidence of acts and corruption on behalf of XXXX and his employees.\n[21] In XXXX 2019, many of the Principal Appellant's former colleagues in the Nayarit employee union demanded meetings with the Secretary General of Nayarit complaining about XXXX corruption. The Principal Appellant saw the head of the union interviewed on the news. The complaints were not successful, and XXXX remained in command.\n[22] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the Principal Appellant returned to his vehicle after exercising in the park where he regularly exercises, and a man approached him and said, \"You spoke, you are going to die.\"2 The man then walked away.\n[23] The Principal Appellant told his wife, the Associate Appellant, who had since XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, been working as an XXXX for the same organization that the Principal Appellant worked at before he resigned. They discussed she should not go into work that day, and they should go into hiding.\n[24] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the Principal Appellant read in the news that one of XXXX employees who had previously resigned in XXXX 2019, and who had gone to the press about being forced to resign, was missing. The Principal Appellant believes this employee is dead, and that XXXX and another employee are behind it, as well as behind the threat made against the Principal Appellant.\n[25] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the Associate Appellant resigned, and on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the Appellants flew to Toronto.\nThe RPD Decision\n[26] The RPD decided that the Appellants have an IFA in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico.\n[27] The RPD found that there is neither a serious possibility of persecution, nor a section 97(1) risk,3 on a balance of probabilities, in Merida.\n[28] The RPD Member found that the Principal Appellant had not mentioned that he was targeted by any cartels, only that he thought XXXX was connected to the CJNG cartel.\n[29] The RPD found that there was no evidence to establish that the criminals, who threatened the Principal Appellant, have a presence in Merida. The RPD found that the Principal Appellant testified that the man who threatened him in the park was unknown to him.\n[30] The RPD concluded that the Appellants had not demonstrated that the agents of harm have the motivation, interest and ability to pursue them in the IFA location.\n[31] The RPD found that the Appellants' lack of a visible profile, absence of demonstrated motivation for the perpetrators to follow them and the absence of evidence establishing that the unknown person who threatened the Principal Appellant in the park is connected to the cartels, are all factors in support of the finding that the proposed IFA is a safe option. The RPD found that the Appellants' family who continue to live in Mexico have not been threatened since the Appellants left.\n[32] The RPD found that there were no serious social, economic, or other barriers to the Appellants relocating to the proposed IFA location. The RPD found that the adult Appellants are educated, they have worked varied jobs in government and public sectors, and that there was no suggestion that they were denied medical care or that any other circumstance existed such that relocation to the IFA location would jeopardize the life and safety of the Appellants.\nPROCEDURAL FAIRNESS\n[33] The Appellants allege that there was procedural unfairness because the RPD Member was unprepared, he did not question or consider documents in evidence, he did not take notes or refer to the transcript, he appeared to fall asleep during the hearing and he failed to complete required administrative duties during the hearing.\n[34] For the reasons detailed below, I am not persuaded by the Appellants' submission that the RPD hearing was procedurally unfair.\n[35] The Appellants submit that the RPD Member stated that he only received their BOC forms the day prior to the hearing, and he could not locate certain documents in the file. The Appellants also argue that they provided several articles of supporting documentary evidence, but the RPD Member did not question the relevance or significance of including such supporting evidence, did not include mention of the evidence in his reasons, and did not consider the documents' relevance in the claim nor place the appropriate weight on the evidence as necessary and required.\n[36] I am not persuaded by these submissions. The Appellants provided a transcript of the RPD hearing in their Appellants' Record. There is a notation on page six of the transcript as follows, \"[Intentionally deleted 0:06:06 - 0:24:10].\"4 I listened to that intentionally deleted portion of the audio file. At 00:06:51 to 00:09:58 of the audio file, the RPD Member reviewed the Consolidated List of Documents, and discussed with Appellants' Counsel as to whether it was complete and whether there were any documents missing from that list.\n[37] Counsel confirmed that documents were sent in on July 8, 2021, that were not included in the list. The RPD Member reviewed the electronic file and located that disclosure. The RPD Member then indicated that he was making a note to ensure that the disclosure of July 8, 2021, was to be included in the Consolidated List of Documents. The Consolidated List of Documents does not appear to have been amended to list the disclosure of July 8, 2021.5 However, the electronic file of the RPD Record includes that disclosure.6\n[38] Based on the conversation during the RPD hearing where the RPD Member and Appellants' Counsel discussed that disclosure, as detailed above, and on the basis that it is included in the RPD Record, I am satisfied that the RPD Member was aware of the disclosure and it formed part of the record.\n[39] I am not persuaded by the Appellants' submission that the RPD Member did not appropriately consider the evidence as demonstrated by him not asking questions about the evidence. The Appellants were represented by Counsel, and had full opportunity during the hearing to discuss the evidence and make submissions on the relevance of the evidence to the RPD Member.\n[40] In my assessment, the RPD Member expressed a serious intention to review all the evidence. I reviewed the audio file of the RPD hearing to assess what took place during a portion of the hearing deleted in the written transcript provided by the Appellants as, \"(Intentionally deleted 2:07:14 - 2:13:45).7 The RPD Member made the following comments to the Appellants:8\nRPD Member: I want you to know, decisions in these cases for me are very serious. I think of the decisions in an immigration hearing to be a lot more important than say, in a criminal court. These decisions to me are much more serious because of the ramifications that they can have down the road. So, I generally don't make a decision right away. I like to look at everything. Meaning I like to look at all the evidence, all the documents, I like to go everything like a fine tooth comb, as we say in North America. Okay. But in all fairness, there are some cases that you can make a decision in 15 minutes okay. In your case, I would like to look over everything so I can be satisfied, okay. And under the circumstances, I agree with Counsel, if she can send me the submissions, I'd like to have a really good look at it, okay. Do you understand that?\nPrincipal Appellant: Si, Muchos Gracias.\nRPD Member: No worries.\n[41] The Appellants indicated that the hearing was conducted as a virtual hearing, and that it was observed by the Appellants' Counsel, Counsel's two colleagues, and the two adult Appellants that the RPD Member did not appear to take any notes during the hearing, either handwritten or on the computer. The Appellants also submit that in the reasons, the RPD Member did not quote from hearing transcripts, as there were no transcripts provided by the RPD, and that the RPD Member did not identify any quotations from the audio of the hearing. They submit that it is questionable whether the RPD Member listened to the audio of the hearing following the hearing to assist in his determination of the case.\n[42] I am not persuaded by these submissions. The test of whether a hearing is procedurally fair is not determined by the quantity of notes that a RPD Member takes during the hearing. The RPD hearing was conducted virtually. The RPD Member could very well have been taking notes, but it was not visible to the participants on the screen. I am not persuaded by the submission that the procedure is unfair because the RPD Decision did not quote the hearing transcript or audio file. A decision is not required to quote from hearing transcripts or the audio file of the hearing, and evidence may be summarized instead. The Appellants' argument that it is \"questionable\" whether the RPD Member listened to the audio of the hearing after the hearing is speculative, and it was also not necessary for the RPD Member to listen to the audio recording of the hearing after the hearing because he conducted the hearing.\n[43] The Appellants submit that the RPD Member was inattentive during the portion of the hearing in which Counsel questioned the claimant, and they query, \"Did he fall asleep?\"9 They suggest that at least twice during Counsel questioning, the RPD Member's eyes closed, and his head nodded down for periods of at least a few minutes. The Appellants indicate that the RPD Member's behavior was noticed and commented on following the hearing by the two adult Appellants, by Counsel, and the two Counsel's colleagues who attended the virtual hearing. The Appellants submit that it is likely that the interpreter observed the RPD Member's behaviour as well. The Appellants submit that this is significant as the most intense and in depth questioning of the hearing took place by the Appellants' Counsel.\n[44] I am not persuaded by this submission. The Appellants argue that this alleged behaviour by the RPD Member was observed by both adult Appellants, by Counsel, two of Counsel's colleagues, and they speculated that it was likely observed by the interpreter. However, the alleged behaviour was not raised as an objection at the RPD hearing, and they did not make an objection at anytime during the two months between the conclusion of the RPD hearing on July 20, 2021, and when the RPD Decision was issued on September 22, 2021. The Appellants have waived their right to make an objection now. I find the following comments by Justice de Montigny of the Federal Court to apply to the circumstances of this case:10\nTurning first to the argument of procedural fairness, it is the applicants' contention that the Board member fell asleep or dozed off during portions of the hearing. They rest their assertion on their own affidavits and that of a friend who was not present at the hearing. This is a difficult argument to make, and I do not think it has been made out in the circumstances of this case.\nThe transcript clearly shows that the Board member did participate in the hearing, asking a number of questions on different aspects of the claim. One can not infer from the silence of the Board member at some points of the hearing that he was not paying attention to what was going on. Moreover, there is no evidence that the applicants, who were represented by counsel, raised an objection at the hearing or immediately after to what they perceived to be a denial of natural justice or procedural fairness. The applicants have therefore waived their right to subsequently raise any such objection before this Court: Lopez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] F.C.J. No. 979 (QL).\n[45] I have reviewed the transcript from the RPD hearing, and I note that the RPD Member did not interrupt Counsel's questioning. This does not mean that he was inattentive. I noted that much of Counsel's questioning covered information that the Principal Appellant had already testified to, or information that was already on record, for example, in his narrative to his BOC form. Therefore, there was no reason for the RPD Member to interject given that information was being repeated through Counsel's questioning.\n[46] The Appellants submit that the RPD Member failed to complete the following administrative duties: he did not ask the adult Appellants to show the BOC signature page as close-ups on the screen and affirm the signatures on the BOC forms were theirs; he did not question the Principal Appellant if he was able and willing to fulfill his obligations as Designated Representative for the Minor Appellant; and he did not instruct the Principal Appellant on his duties in his capacity as a Designated Representative for the Minor Appellant. The Appellants also argue that the RPD Member, neither at the beginning of the hearing, when the witness was present, nor, when given a second chance, at the time when the witness re-joined the hearing by phone, did he request solemn affirmation from the witness that evidence given by the witness would be truthful, and he did not advise the witness to refrain from disclosing anything discussed in the hearing as the hearing proceedings are confidential in nature.\n[47] I am not persuaded by these submissions. With respect to the submission that the RPD Member did not display the signature page of the Appellants' BOC forms on the screen and ask them if they affirmed the signatures were theirs, the Appellants have failed to demonstrate that this resulted in a procedurally unfair hearing. I reviewed the transcript from the RPD hearing provided by the Appellants, and the RPD Member confirmed with the Appellants that they were being truthful, during the following exchange:11\nRPD Member: And do you -- okay. And do you also, do you also affirm that all documents and evidence that you have provided in support of your claim, including any BOC amendments, are complete, true and accurate?\n(Intentionally deleted 0:06:06 - 0:24:10)\n[48] I listened to the intentionally deleted portion of the transcript, and the Appellants answered \"Yes.\"12\n[49] With respect to the submission that the RPD Member did not remind the Designated Representative of his duties, I reviewed the electronic file and note that on October 13, 2021, the Immigration and Refugee Board sent a letter to the Principal Appellant confirming his designation as the Designated Representative for the Minor Appellant and reminding him of his responsibilities as the Designated Representative. If the RPD Member omitted to orally remind the Principal Appellant of his duties at the RPD hearing, it was an administrative oversight that did not affect the procedural fairness of the RPD hearing, and in any event, an oral reminder was unnecessary as he had already been reminded of his duties by way of letter. Likewise, if the RPD Member failed to have the witness affirm to be truthful, and remind the witness that the proceedings are confidential, the Appellants have failed to demonstrate how this administrative oversight affected the procedural fairness of the hearing.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[50] The Appellants have submitted the following documents for me to consider as new evidence for this appeal, as follows:13\nAccepted\nItem 1: Article + translation: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Gente & Poder dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021;\nItem 2: Article + translation: Increased feeling of insecurity among Merida residents (INEGI), The Yucatan Times dated October 21, 2021;\nItem 3: Article + translation: Impunity gives 'wings' to crimes against journalists in Mexico, Yucatan ala Mano.com dated November 2, 2021;\nItem 4: Article + translation: Judith Aracely Gomez, former senior officer of the PGR, is linked to the process, Yucatan ala Mano.com dated October 23, 2021;\nItem 5: Article + translation: Mexico, the fifth worst country in corruption: The World Justice Project, Yucatan ala Mano.com dated October 19, 2021;\nItem 6: Article + translation: Maria Jose relatives demand justice in form of the Yucatan Government Palace, The Yucatan Times dated October 22, 2021;\nItem 7: Article + translation: An 'almost total' impunity reigns in Mexico when it comes to violent crimes, reports, The Yucatan Times dated October 13, 2021;\nItem 8: Article + translation: September is the deadliest month in Mexico so far in 2021, The Yucatan Times dated October 13, 2021;\nItem 9: Article + translation: Mexico's powerful Jalisco cartel is flexing its muscles at opposite ends of Latin America, Insider Magazine dated October 18, 2021;\nItem 10: Article + translation: CJNG comes to occupy the square in Yucatan, Quinto Fuerza dated November 4, 2021;\nItem 11: Article + translation: Yucatan declares itself on alert due to the presence of the CJNG, Cronica.com.mx dated November 4, 2021;\nItem 12: Article + translation: Kanasin in alleged dispute by criminal groups, La Verdad dated November 4, 2021;\nItem 13: Article + translation: Three people were arrested in Merida for hanging blankets with threatening messages, The Yucatan Times dated November 3, 2021;\nItem 14: Article + translation: The three detainees in Merida are from the Jalisco Cartel, almomento.mx dated November 3, 2021;\nItem 15: Article + translation: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, The Mexican Herald dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021;\nItem 16: Nominal Voter's List -INE: Instituto Nacional Electoral undated;\nItem 17: Article + translation: Mexico's military arrests wife of powerful drug lord \"El Mencho\", Reuters America dated November 16, 2021;\nItem 18: Article + translation: Mexico's most wanted: Wife of cartel boss 'El Mencho' held, BBC News dated November 16, 2021;\nItem 19: Article + translation: Mexico Ablaze as Jalisco Cartel Seeks Criminal Hegemony, InSight Crime dated January 5, 2022;\nRejected\nItem 20: Letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, from Principal Appellant;\nItem 21: Letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, from XXXX XXXX, XXXXandXXXX XXXX of a non-profit called XXXX XXXX XXXX;\nItem 22: Letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, family physician and XXXX XXXX; and,\nItem 23: Letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, family physician.\n[51] According to section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), I can only accept evidence that:\na. arose after the RPD decision (the RPD hearing took place on July 20, 2021, and the RPD Decision was issued on September 22, 2021);\nb. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\nc. that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[52] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.14\n[53] I am admitting items 1 to 19 as new evidence. These documents meet the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA. Items 1-14 and 17-19 are articles published after the RDP Decision. Item 15 is dated September 20, 2021, only two days before the RPD Decision, so the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected to provide that document to the RPD before its decision. Item 16 is undated but includes charts as of January 7, 2022, indicating that it is a document that arose after the RPD Decision. The documents are new, and credible in terms of the source and the circumstances in which they came into existence (i.e., they appear to be articles from on-line news sources). The documents are relevant in that they address the Appellants' arguments about the safety of the proposed IFA of Merida.\n[54] I am not admitting items 20 to 23. These items do not meet the requirements of section 110(4) of the IPRA. It is not the date of the document that is determinative, but rather the information contained within the document that must be assessed when considering section 110(4) of the IRPA. The information in items 20 to 23 could have been provided before the RPD Decision. The Appellants have not explained why the information in these documents was not reasonably available at the time of the RPD Decision, or why they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring the information to the RPD before its decision.\n[55] Specifically, item 20 is a letter from the Principal Appellant indicating that he did not make himself understood very well in the hearing because of nerves, receiving little attention and general emotional stability. However, the information he provides either repeats information that was before the RPD or is information that could have been provided at the RPD hearing. If the Principal Appellant was feeling nervous, he could have requested an adjournment to gather himself so that he could have provided the information to the RPD Member. Items 21 to 23 are letters advocating for a positive decision for the Appellants, but they contain information that arose before the RPD Decision.\nORAL HEARING\n[56] I dismiss the Appellants' request for an oral hearing. The new evidence that has been admitted does not fall within the requirements set out in section 110(6) of the IRPA, which indicates that for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to have an oral hearing, the new evidence must raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellants; must be central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claims; and, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claims.\nANALYSIS\n[57] I find that after correctly giving notice at the RPD hearing that an IFA would be an issue, and specifically that the proposed IFA location was Merida,15 the RPD correctly decided that the Appellants have a viable IFA in that location, and that they are therefore not entitled to refugee protection.\nIFA: General Principles\n[58] The Federal Court has explained the general principles for an IFA, and has indicated that to determine if a viable IFA exists, the RAD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that:16\na. the claimant will not be subject to persecution (on a \"serious possibility\" standard), or a section 97 danger or risk (on a \"more likely than not\" standard) in the proposed IFA; and,\nb. in all the circumstances, including circumstances particular to the claimant, conditions in the IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n[59] Both above \"prongs\" of the test must be satisfied to conclude that a refugee claimant has a viable IFA. The threshold on the second prong of the IFA test is a high one. There must be \"actual and concrete evidence\" of conditions that would jeopardize the claimant's life and safety in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. Once the potential for an IFA is raised, the claimant bears the onus of establishing it is not viable.\nFirst Prong: No risk of persecution or harm in Merida\n[60] I find that the Appellants will not be subject to persecution under section 96 of the IRPA (on a \"serious possibility\" standard), or a section 97 danger or risk (on a \"more likely than not\" standard) in the proposed IFA of Merida. I have reached this finding because, as I will detail below, the Appellants have not established that XXXX, either individually or through an alleged connection with the CJNG or corrupt officials, is motivated to track the Appellants to Merida.\n[61] Justice McHaffie discussed the difference between the ability of an agent of harm to track someone, and their motivation to do so:17\nIt is important to note that there is a difference between a persecutor's ability to pursue an individual throughout a country and his desire to do so or interest in doing so. The fact that a persecutor is able to pursue an individual is not decisive evidence that he is motivated to do so. If the persecutor has no desire to find, pursue and\/or persecute an individual, or interest in doing so, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no serious possibility of persecution.\n[62] The Appellants have not established that XXXX has the motivation to track them to the proposed IFA of Merida. The Principal Appellant testified that he was threatened twice,18 but I find that these threats do not support that XXXX is motivated to track the Appellants to the proposed IFA of Merida.\n[63] The first threat took place in XXXX 2018 through text messages with XXXX. The Principal Appellant explained that XXXX had called him for a meeting, which they typically held to talk about the next day's workload. The Principal Appellant alleges that at that time, XXXX sent a photograph of a firearm. The Principal Appellant testified that he asked XXXX why he wanted that, and that XXXX replied, \"Well, for those who bothers us.\"19 The Principal Appellant testified that he responded that they did not need that gun, and only needed their brains to solve things. When asked whether he thought the threat was directed at him or just general, the Principal Appellant testified, \"I, I felt that was in general but also it was personal to me, if I ever dare to say anything against him.\"20 Given this testimony, I disagree with the Appellants' submission that this text message constituted a personal risk to the Principal Appellant. As the Principal Appellant testified, XXXX indicated to the Principal Appellant that the gun was for those \"who bother us.\" He did not indicate that the gun would be used against the Principal Appellant if he ever turned against XXXX.\n[64] The Principal Appellant testified that the second threat occurred in XXXX 2019. The Principal Appellant testified that he was returning to his truck when a person approached him and said, \"You talked and you're gonna be fucked up.\"21 In their Memorandum of Argument, Appellants' Counsel submits, \"[Principal Appellant], in conversations with counsel, confided that he believes the man in the park to be the same man, XXXX [i.e,, a man the Appellants allege XXXX regularly conducted illegal business with].\"22 I do not give this submission weight as it is inconsistent with the Principal Appellant's testimony. The Principal Appellant testified, \"I don't know that person. I didn't know who that person was.\"23 The Principal Appellant indicated that he had never seen that person before, or after the incident.24 He also testified that he did not have any problems for the four months between when he resigned his job and the incident in the park, and he assumed that when the person made the threat in the park it was because somebody knew the Principal Appellant spoke to a journalist.25 Given the Principal Appellant's testimony, I find the Principal Appellant is speculating when he submits in his Memorandum of Argument that he is aware of the identity of the person who allegedly threatened him at the park. There is a lack of evidence that the perpetrator has any connection to the CJNG, as alleged.\n[65] I considered the Appellants' argument that the CJNG is involved because one of XXXX employees has a brother involved in the CJNG. I find this connection speculative as to whether the CJNG would be motivated to track and pursue the Appellants to Merida. That XXXX knows someone who has a brother in the CJNG is a speculative connection to establish that the CJNG are involved and have any interest in the Appellants.\n[66] Even if there was a connection to the CJNG, it is a common-sense proposition that one of the first places such a gang would go is to the Appellants' family.26 In this case, no one has approached the Appellants' family in Mexico in any meaningful way.\n[67] When asked if people in Mexico were asking about the Appellants, the Principal Appellant responded, \"There have been a lot of people in a normal sense of social way, because we no longer live there.\"27 The Principal Appellant later testified that some firefighters see his brother, who works at the hospital, and that the firefighters show interest in what's going on with the Principal Appellant.28 The Principal Appellant speculated that these firefighters are just messengers for XXXX, and that XXXX is looking for the Principal Appellant.\n[68] I find that this evidence is not persuasive. That firefighters ask about the Principal Appellant when they happen to come to the hospital with a patient and see the Principal Appellant's brother, does not suggest they are pursuing the Principal Appellant. If they were attempting to actively track the Principal Appellant one would expect they would make a specific trip to the hospital to specifically question the brother there. Asking about the Principal Appellant while they are at the hospital for another purpose is suggestive that the inquiry is more, as the Principal Appellant, testified, a \"social\" inquiry.\n[69] I considered the Appellants' submission that the Principal Appellant has a similar profile to a former colleague who went missing, and a young man who was found dead after reporting different corruption to the Mexican President. I do not agree that these circumstances are similar to the Principal Appellant's circumstances.\n[70] I give low weight to the submission that the Principal Appellant has a similar profile to a former colleague that had gone missing after reporting XXXX corruption, and the Principal Appellant's belief that XXXX was involved. First, there is a lack of evidence that XXXX, or anyone associated with him, was involved in this colleague's disappearance. The Principal Appellant is speculating that XXXX is involved. Second, the fact that a colleague went missing in the neighbour town of XXXX XXXX XXXX, does not indicate that the Appellants would face the same risk if they were to relocate to Merida, which is a significant distance away from Nayarit. Third, the circumstances of the former colleague are different than those of the Principal Appellant. Appellants' Counsel indicated in the Memorandum of Argument that the former colleague threatened that he was willing to report more information against XXXX.29 There is no indication that the Principal Appellant has threatened or intends to threaten further disclosure. I also note that Appellants' Counsel submitted that the former colleague's disappearance is evidence that XXXX, \"... when motivated, does not waste time, but retaliates to the full extend (sic), immediately.\"30 Based on this reasoning, and the evidence that retaliation did not occur against the Principal Appellant, it would suggest that XXXX is not motivated to pursue the Principal Appellant.\n[71] The news story about a young man that had gone missing after he reported an incident he was involved in to the President is also unhelpful as it involves a young man who went missing in Nayarit after making a complaint about activities there. It is not helpful in addressing whether the Appellants will be tracked and pursued to the IFA of Merida because of their specific circumstances.\n[72] I considered the Appellants' argument that his meeting with the Police Chief of the State of Nayarit was futile and pointless. That the police were unwilling to act on the Principal Appellant's complaint does not mean that they intend to persecute or harm the Appellants, and does not mean that they would be motivated to track and pursue the Appellants to the proposed IFA of Merida.\n[73] Likewise, I am not persuaded by the Appellants' submission that corrupt officials that know XXXX would be interested in pursuing the Appellants to the IFA of Merida. That XXXX might have a relationship with corrupt officials does not mean that those corrupt officials will have the motivation or interest to track the Appellants' return to Mexico, to then track and determine that they have relocated to Merida, and then to pursue them to their specific location in Merida.\n[74] I considered the Principal Appellant's testimony that he would be recognized in Merida because he was in XXXX XXXX, he was a XXXX playing in videos, and was part of a XXXX London documentary filmed in Mexico.31 The Principal Appellant also testified that he would be found illegally through the police, databases and the CJNG.\n[75] I am not persuaded by these submissions. First, the Principal Appellant indicated that he had stopped playing in his XXXX XXXX in 2007, and only played casually thereafter.32 Therefore, there is a lack of evidence that he has any current profile from being in this XXXX many years ago. Second, I do not have sufficient evidence that the Principal Appellant would be recognizable in Merida from his work years ago as a XXXX on television. Thirdly, even if he were recognized in Merida, that does not mean that there is a risk of persecution or harm from XXXX. The allegation that the Appellants would be illegally found through the police, databases and the alleged connection with the CJNG (which I have not accepted for the reasons outline above), is all premised on XXXX having the motivation to track and pursue the Appellants to Merida. For the reasons I have outlined above, I find that XXXX does not have the motivation to track the Appellants to the proposed IFA of Merida, and that it is unlikely that the CJNG or corrupt officials are motivated to track the Appellants to Merida either.\nSecond Prong: Relocating to Merida is not unreasonable\n[76] With respect to the second prong of the IFA test, I find in all the circumstances, including circumstances particular to the Appellants, that conditions in the IFA of Merida are such that it would not be unreasonable for the Appellants to seek refuge there.\n[77] The Appellants have not met the onus of establishing that it is not viable to relocate to Merida. They have not provided actual and concrete evidence of conditions that would jeopardize their lives and safety in travelling or temporarily relocating to the proposed IFA of Merida.\n[78] The Appellants have provided numerous news articles about the CJNG, which have been admitted as new evidence. This information is of a general nature. The Federal Court has held that the onus is on the claimant to establish that a link exists between the general documentary evidence and his or her specific circumstances, and \"[t]he fact that documentary evidence shows the human rights situation in a country is problematic does not mean necessarily there is a risk to a given individual.\"33\n[79] The Appellants argue that the Principal Appellant would suffer mental and emotional strain if he were to return to Mexico. This is insufficient to make the IFA unreasonable. The Federal Court has commented, \"Additionally, humanitarian and compassionate reasons, such as the loss of a job, a reduction in the quality of life or the loss of aspiration do not suffice to conclude that there is no IFA.\"34 Refugee protection in Canada cannot be given simply because one might be better off physically, economically and emotionally here than in a safe place in their own country.35\nCONCLUSION\n[80] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nDerek Vermette\nDerek Vermette\nFebruary 21, 2022\nDate\n1 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n2 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Basis of Claim (BOC) form narrative, at p. 29, para. 32.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, section 97(1).\n4 Exhibit P-2, Appellants' Record, RPD Hearing Transcript, at p. 6, line 13.\n5 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Consolidated List of Documents, at p. 79.\n6 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Claimant's Evidence - Submitted on July 08, 2021, at p. 389.\n7 Exhibit P-2, Appellants' Record, RPD Hearing Transcript, at p. 55, line 29.\n8 Audio of RPD Hearing, 2:09:13 to 2:11:14.\n9 Exhibit P-2, Appellants' Record, Memorandum of Argument, Section 3c, at p. 75.\n10 Sukhu v.

However, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concluded that they are likely also citizens of Armenia. The RPD noted that the appellants did not face any risks in Armenia and therefore did not address what their risk might be in Syria. The appellants argue that it was an error to conclude that the fact that they once had passports from Armenia created the presumption that they were citizens of that country, since those were merely passports of convenience. Furthermore, even assuming that they had dual nationality, it was still incumbent on the RPD to assess their prospective risk in the event of a return to Syria, as that was their first country of nationality, meaning the one where they were born and where they had always lived before coming to Canada.\n[2] The appeals are dismissed. The appellants' arguments are without merit. In the absence of credible evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to presume that the Armenian authorities agreed to issue passports to the appellants because Armenia considers them to be citizens of that country. The assertion that these were merely passports of convenience and not evidence of citizenship is contradicted by the fact that the appellants used them when applying for visas for the United States. The documentary evidence also shows that the appellants were eligible for Armenian citizenship without having to renounce their Syrian citizenship and regardless of the fact that they were not living in Armenia, because they are of Armenian ethnic ancestry. Since the appellants failed to demonstrate that they would face a prospective risk in Armenia, there is no need to determine what their risk would be in returning to Syria.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The appellants allegedly lived only in Syria before coming to Canada in XXXX 2019. The male appellant is a XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX, and it was his XXXX that posted him to Canada. The appellants are originally from Aleppo, Syria, which fell under the control of the Islamic State (IS) in June 2012. It was not until after they arrived in Canada that the appellants claimed refugee protection, stating that they would be killed if they were to return to Syria, either by the IS or by rebels who considered them Syrian government supporters.\n[4] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (the Minister) filed a written intervention before the RPD in which he opposes these refugee protection claims.1 The Minister stated that he learned from the US authorities that in 2016 the appellants had applied for visas while they were in Armenia. At that time, they stated that they had dual Syrian and Armenian nationality and submitted Armenian passports that had been issued to them in 2013 for a period of 10 years.\n[5] At the RPD hearing, the appellants argued that the XXXX XXXX XXXX had procured their Armenian passports for them to facilitate their travel in Lebanon and Syria. They described them as passports of convenience but maintained that they did not have Armenian citizenship because they were ineligible, as they had never lived in Armenia. Also, in 2018, they had returned their Armenian passports to their XXXX, which then took care of giving them back to the Armenian authorities.\n[6] The RPD concluded that the appellant were likely citizens of Armenia in addition to being Syrian citizens.2 It noted several contradictions in the evidence that undermined the appellants' credibility with regard to the reason why they were able to acquire Armenian passports. Satisfied that the appellants would not face any risks in Armenia, the RPD considered it unnecessary to address whether their fear about potentially returning to Syria was well founded.\n[7] The appellants argue that the RPD should have assessed the risk of returning to Syria since it is their first country of nationality.3 They also state that the RPD erred in concluding that they are presumed to be citizens of Armenia solely because they had once had passports from that country. In their opinion, the documentary evidence clearly shows that they are ineligible for Armenian citizenship because they have not lived in Armenia and they have another citizenship that they have not renounced. They argue that the RPD did not give sufficient weight to a letter from the Embassy of Armenia to Canada confirming that they are not registered with that embassy.4\nANALYSIS\n[8] I agree with the RPD's conclusions. Although a country may issue a passport to someone who is not a citizen of that country, it would be an exceptional measure, making it reasonable to presume, barring evidence to the contrary, that someone who holds a passport from any country is a citizen of that country. The onus is on that person to demonstrate that such is not the case. The appellants are incorrect in claiming that they are ineligible for Armenian citizenship. The documentary evidence shows that, for people of Armenian ethnic ancestry, living in Armenia is not necessary and having another nationality is not prohibited. Lastly, the RPD was not required to assess the appellants' risk if they were to return to Syria, since they have another nationality.\nArmenian citizenship is available to the appellants if they do not already have it\n[9] First, it is important to explain that the determinative issue is not so much whether the appellants already have Armenian citizenship but rather whether such citizenship is reasonably available to them. In Williams,5 the Federal Court of Appeal states, \"Where citizenship in another country is available, an applicant is expected to make attempts to acquire it and will be denied refugee status if it is shown that it is within his power to acquire that other citizenship.\" The Court concurred in Tretsetsang.6\n[10] I note that the appellants could have obtained Armenian citizenship as of 2007, the year in which changes were made to Armenia's citizenship law to permit individuals of Armenian ethnic ancestry, anywhere in the world, to acquire citizenship without having to renounce any other citizenship that they possess.7 Although the issue of the appellants' ethnic ancestry was not explored in detail at the RPD hearing, I note that they have an Armenian last name, that they stated in their refugee protection claims that they speak Armenian and that the male appellant is a XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is reasonable to presume, in these circumstances, that the provisions of 2007 would apply to them.\nOn a balance of probabilities, the appellants are citizens of Armenia\n[11] The appellants' testimony does not benefit from the presumption of truthfulness with regard to their claim that they never acquired Armenian citizenship. There are two reasons for this. First, the presumption that the holder of a passport is a citizen of the issuing country outweighs the presumption of truthfulness of the refugee protection claimant's testimony. Second, the appellants' past behaviour when they applied for US visas in 2016 demonstrates that, at that time, they apparently considered themselves Armenian citizens and not mere holders of passports of convenience.\n[12] The appellants' credibility is also undermined by their behaviour during an interview with an immigration officer in February 2020, after they had filed their refugee protection claims. According to the Minister's written intervention and in particular the notes from that interview, the appellants at that time wanted to conceal the fact that they had applied for US visas in 2016, stating that their most recent application was in 2005. When confronted with the fact that the US authorities had disclosed this information, the appellants tried to claim that this was an initiative by a travel agency, but they did not know whether the visa applications had actually been submitted. They ultimately admitted that they had been fingerprinted as part of the process.8 This attempt to conceal their efforts to travel to the United States in 2016 using Armenian passports was completely intentional on their part and not a mere oversight.\n[13] Of course, had the appellants managed to submit credible evidence from relevant authorities in Armenia that they were not citizens of that country, I would have had no choice but to believe them. Indeed, the RPD them the opportunity to do so. Yet all they managed to obtain was a consular letter stating that they are not registered with the Embassy of Armenia to Canada. This has absolutely no bearing on the question of whether or not they are Armenian citizens; it merely establishes that the appellants themselves did not take steps to register with the Armenian embassy after they arrived in Canada.\n[14] The RPD fully explains in paragraphs 21 to 25 of its decision why the appellants' evidence is deficient. Having read that, the appellants could have considered, at any point in the appeal process, trying to obtain clear and specific confirmation from the Armenian authorities that they are not Armenian citizens. Subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act) provides for the possibility of submitting new evidence on appeal that was not reasonably available at the time of the proceedings before the RPD. It has been nine months since the appellants filed their appeal. I received no new evidence from them. From that, I infer that the Armenian authorities are not prepared to corroborate their version of the facts.\nIt is not necessary to assess their prospective risk in the event of a return to Syria\n[15] Having concluded, on a balance of probabilities, that the appellants are citizens of both Syria and Armenia, I note that appellants failed to demonstrate that they face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in one of those two countries of nationality, namely, Armenia. I agree with the RPD that the appellants failed to demonstrate that Armenia is likely to send them back to Syria.\n[16] There is no legal basis to the appellants' argument that their prospective risk in Syria must be assessed. Although they describe Syria as their first country of nationality, since that is where they have lived most of their lives, the Act does not provide any order of precedence as to which country must be assessed when a refugee protection claimant has multiple nationalities. Such a claimant is required to establish that there is a prospective risk in all their countries of nationality. In this case, the appellants failed to demonstrate that there is a prospective risk in one of their countries of nationality, namely, Armenia. In the circumstances, they do not meet the requirements set out in the Act to be recognized as refugees or persons in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] The appellants failed to provide credible evidence to rebut the presumption created by their Armenian passports that they possess the nationality of that country. Furthermore, the evidence does not show that they would face any risk if they were removed to Armenia. Therefore, the appeals are dismissed.\n(signed)\nPhilippe Rabot\nPhilippe Rabot\nJune 2, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Refugee Protection Division (RPD) record, pages 117 to 124.\n2 Ibid., pages 3 to 12.\n3 Appeal record, pages 26 to 31.\n4 RPD record, Exhibit C-32, page 251.\n5 Williams v.

He appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated October 12, 2021, rejecting his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in assessing his claim and asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow his appeal and determine that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA). The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant alleges that he fears persecution by members of the Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) because of his Muslim identity and because he is a member of the Indian Union Muslim League (Muslim League).2\n[4] The RPD found that the Appellant's evidence was generally credible except in relation to internal flight alternative (IFA), which it found to be the determinative issue. The RPD found that the Appellant had a viable IFA in several locations, including Hyderabad.\n[5] On appeal, the Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of IFA.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\nThe new evidence is accepted\n[6] The Appellant tendered the following new evidence:\na) \"Rise in mental illness cases a worry but Telangana lacks doctors,\" The Times of India, July 25, 2021;3 and\nb) \"Hyderabad: Mental health doctors remain few in numbers,\" Deccan Chronicle, June 24, 2019.4\n[7] The Appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of his claim or that was not reasonably available at the time of the rejection, or that he could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection.5 If the evidence meets one of these requirements, I must consider whether it passes the tests of credibility, relevance and newness affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh.6\n[8] The Appellant submits that, although the articles submitted as new evidence are dated prior to the hearing, he did not receive the report containing his mental health diagnosis until after the hearing and then made an application to submit that document. As a result, the articles were not provided previously. The Appellant further submits that the new evidence provides additional evidence on the availability of mental health services in the proposed IFA location.\n[9] I note that the second date of the RPD hearing took place on September 21, 2021, the XXXX XXXX XXXX assessment report was dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021,7 and it was provided to the RPD with the Appellant's counsel's written submissions, dated October 4, 2021.8 The claim was rejected in the RPD decision dated October 12, 2021. Given when the Appellant received the XXXX XXXX XXXX assessment report, I find that he could not reasonably have been expected to have presented the new evidence, which relates to the availability of mental health services in the proposed IFA location, in the brief period of time before the rejection of the claim. As a result, the new evidence satisfies s. 110(4) of the IRPA. I further find that the new evidence passes the test in Singh because: it is credible as its source is media outlets; it is relevant in the sense that it is capable of proving a fact that is relevant to the claim for protection, regarding the availability of mental health services; and it is new in the sense that it is capable of proving the current state of affairs regarding mental health services in India.\n[10] Therefore, I accept the new evidence.\nAn oral hearing is not required\n[11] Under s. 110(6) of the IRPA, the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is new evidence that: raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal; is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[12] The Appellant requested an oral hearing. Having admitted new evidence, I have assessed whether an oral hearing should be held. I find that the evidence is objective documentary evidence, which does not raise a serious issue with respect to the Appellant's credibility. Therefore, an oral hearing is not required.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE\n[13] The determinative issue is IFA.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[14] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.9 I have carried out my own independent analysis of the evidence to determine whether the RPD erred.\nANALYSIS\n[15] For the following reasons, I find that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Hyderabad.\n[16] Having independently reviewed the record, I agree with the RPD's finding that the Appellant's evidence was generally credible, and I have assessed his evidence relating to IFA in my analysis below. I note that the RPD referred to several IFA locations in its decision but focused on Hyderabad. I have considered only Hyderabad in my IFA assessment.\n[17] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA is two-pronged, and both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the Appellant has a viable IFA. First, I must find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the Appellant being persecuted under section 96 of the IRPA, nor a risk to life, danger of torture or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under section 97, in the proposed IFA. Second, I must find, on a balance of probabilities, that conditions in the proposed IFA are not such that it would be objectively unreasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the Appellant, to relocate and reside there. Once an IFA has been proposed, the Appellant bears the burden of proof to show that they do not have an IFA.10\nThe Appellant has not established that he faces a section 96 or section 97 risk in Hyderabad\n[18] The RPD found that the Appellant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that the agents of persecution have the means or motivation to locate him in the proposed IFA. The RPD found the Appellant's evidence that he will be located because a photograph of him is \"out there\" to be vague and speculative. The RPD also found it speculative that the agents of persecution would be able to locate the Appellant in the proposed IFA through the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) database given that he is not charges with any crimes.\n[19] The Appellant submits that the RPD misconstrued his evidence, stating that his picture is circulating in the community and on social media, and that his name is at the top of the RSS\/BJP hit list because he made the Muslim League strong. He also submits that the objective evidence states that Muslims are targeted and killed in India. The Appellant further submits that the police are affiliated with the RSS\/BJP.\n[20] The Appellant gave evidence that individuals connected with the RSS\/BJP had pursued and attacked him when he visited his family's community in India and that they went to his mother's residence to threaten to kill him.11 His wife has told him that her friends say that his photo \"was being circulated in public by people connected to BJP RSS.\"12 At the RPD hearing, the Appellant testified concerning his membership with the Muslim League, which involved social activities and political campaigning at the local election level from 2006 to 2008. 13 He said that the police had located him in his community in XXXX 2016 because they were given his picture and used it to check with his neighbours.14 The Appellant repeatedly stated that he believed his picture was \"out there\" and circulating.15 He also testified that he had stayed in hiding in Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai for a period of time in 2018.16\n[21] I find, based on the Appellant's evidence, that the agents of persecution may have continued to be motivated to find him. However, I find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of persecution have the means to locate him in Hyderabad.\n[22] I accept that the Appellant believes that the agents of persecution may locate him in Hyderabad because his photograph has been circulated by the RSS\/BJP and possibly distributed through social media, specifically WhatsApp. However, I find that the Appellant has not met the onus to establish that the dissemination of his photograph could be used to locate him in Hyderabad.\n[23] The Appellant submits that geographical boundaries are irrelevant due to current communication technologies and that a photograph shared in a WhatsApp group could be available to any IFA location where RSS\/BJP members of that group reside, including Hyderabad, so that they could \"easily\" locate him.17 However, the Appellant does not provide any evidence beyond his testimony to establish how his photograph would be used to find him in Hyderabad. I have reviewed the objective evidence and find nothing to indicate that social media tools such as WhatsApp are routinely used as a method of tracing and locating individuals. The objective evidence instead focuses on the use of social media by groups to communicate with each other and to spread misinformation.18\n[24] While I acknowledge the Appellant's evidence that his photograph was used to search for him in his own neighbourhood, I find based on the evidence that the Appellant has not established that his agents of persecution could locate him in Hyderabad as the result of his photograph being shared on social media. The country condition evidence indicates that Hyderabad is a very large city with a population of about 10.269 million,19 located hundreds of kilometres away from XXXX, Kerala, where the Appellant lived.20 Hyderabad is in Telangana state, where 4.465 million or approximately 12.7 percent of residents are Muslims, and the Muslim population in Hyderabad is estimated to be 1.713 million.21 Between 30 and 40 percent of Hyderabad's population is Muslim.22 I find, given the size of Hyderabad and its Muslim population, that there is no more than a mere possibility that the Appellant would be identified by his agents of persecution there based on standing out as a Muslim or based on his photograph having been circulated on social media.\n[25] Regarding the Appellant's submission that the police are affiliated with the agents of persecution, I have reviewed the objective evidence concerning the potential means of the police to locate him. I note that the Appellant did not specifically address in his submissions how the police would locate him.\n[26] I find that the Appellant has not established that the police have the means to locate him, based on the objective evidence. Although the Appellant believes himself to be on a hit list, I find that the evidence of his activities with the Muslim League, involvement in local social activities and political campaigning in the mid-2000s, establishes a relatively low profile for the Appellant, on a balance of probabilities. While computer tracking systems and databases, such as the CCTNS, exist in India, the objective evidence indicates that there is little inter-state communication except in cases of major crimes such as smuggling, terrorism, and high-profile organized crime, and there is no evidence that the Appellant is of interest to the police for any of these reasons. It has been reported that police stations are \"virtually unconnected islands\" across India,23 and that there is no centralized registration system allowing police to check the whereabouts of inhabitants in their own state, let alone in other states. Police systems are not integrated between districts and states, and they generally can only communicate within a state or a district.24\n[27] While the objective evidence indicates that police stations can use the CCTNS database to collect and share information on criminals and that CCTNS software is available at 96 percent of police stations in India, there are considerable differences in the versions of the software used in different states and it is difficult to use it to locate individuals.25 Many jurisdictions have implemented tenant verification programs to maintain a database of where criminals reside.26 In Hyderabad, tenant registration is a feature of a mobile app launched by the police through which tenant photographs and other details can be uploaded to the city police database. However, even where police access the CCTNS to screen for criminal backgrounds using tenant verification information, the objective evidence indicates that the police cannot verify all new tenants.27 Overall, given the relatively low profile of the Appellant, I find that the objective evidence does not establish that there is more than a mere possibility that the police would have the means to locate him in Hyderabad.\n[28] I have also considered the objective evidence regarding the risk to Muslims, noting the Appellant's testimony that he would continue to be a member of the Muslim League if he returned to India.28 The objective evidence about the treatment of Muslims in India is mixed overall, indicating that they face discrimination in different contexts in India, including in acquiring citizenship, and are disproportionately affected by communal violence. There were reports in 2020 that the Hyderabad police conducted operations to monitor suspicious persons and illegal activities, targeting poor and Muslim areas. There have been attacks on Muslims by cow protection groups in recent years and, in 2020, there were between 40 and 51 deaths resulting from the Delhi riots, most of them Muslims. There were also attacks on Muslims accused of conspiring to spread COVID-19 in 2020.29 In October 2019, Amnesty International recorded 72 incidents of mob violence in India overall during the first half of that year, 37 of which were directed at Muslims.30 There is objective evidence from 2011 stating that the large number of Muslims in the \"Old City\" of Hyderabad gives rise to communal tensions and violence between Hindus and Muslims breaks out from time to time.31\n[29] However, notwithstanding these incidents of violence against Muslims in India, including in Hyderabad, I note that the number of these incidents is very low relative to the Muslim population in India of 172.2 million.32 While any incident of violence is unacceptable, the frequency with which such events occur is not sufficient to establish a serious possibility of persecution given the size of the Muslim population. I find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that violence toward Muslims is so widespread or frequent that there is a serious possibility that he will be at risk of persecution or harm in Hyderabad as a Muslim.\n[30] Regarding the discrimination faced by Muslims, the objective evidence indicates that Muslims face a low risk of official discrimination in India, and that while many Muslims live day-to-day with low levels of societal discrimination and violence, the risk of such discrimination and violence is higher for Muslims involved in cow slaughter. Moreover, these incidents, although widely reported, have not affected the day-to-day lives of most Muslims.33 I further note the Federal Court jurisprudence finding that for discrimination to rise to the level of persecution, the mistreatment must be serious and must occur with repetition. Serious mistreatment will be found where there is a severe restriction or denial of a core right, including the right to participate in the political process, earn a livelihood, practice a religion, or access normally available educational facilities.34 The objective evidence does not indicate that this is generally the case for Muslims in India.35 I find that the Appellant has not established that discrimination against Muslims in India rises to the level of persecution.\n[31] Therefore, I find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the RSS\/BJP would be able to locate him in Hyderabad, such that he faces a serious possibility of persecution, or a subsection 97(1) risk, in the proposed IFA location.\nThe Appellant has not established that it would be objectively unreasonable for him to relocate to Hyderabad\n[32] The RPD found that the conditions in Hyderabad are such that it would not be unreasonable for the Appellant to seek refuge there and that, while he may encounter some hardships in relocating, these hardships do not meet the high threshold that would make the proposed IFA unreasonable.\n[33] The Appellant submits that it would be unreasonable for him to relocate to Hyderabad because he would have to live in hiding, his children would not be able to attend school, he would have limited employment opportunities, he would not have good access to health care, and his mental health issues would place him at greater risk than the general population.\n[34] The Appellant gave evidence that he had a range of employment experience, including XXXX for XXXX and in XXXXandXXXX XXXX.36 The objective evidence states that Muslims tend to occupy work positions lacking social security and fixed sources of income, which are highly concentrated in the industrial sector, and that 98.9 percent of Muslims are employed in the informal sector in Hyderabad, relative to 87.2 percent of Hindus working in that sector.37 While the Appellant may face limited employment opportunities in the proposed IFA, I find that his past work experiences were primarily in the XXXXand XXXX sectors, and find that it would not constitute undue hardship for him to work in one of these fields.\n[35] While the objective evidence reports that Muslims in India have less access to health care than other groups,38 it also indicates that Indian law provides for minority community status for Muslims, making the Appellant eligible for government assistance programs.39 I note that the Appellant provided a XXXX XXXX XXXX Assessment Report by a XXXX XXXX XXXX, who assessed the Appellant as exhibiting symptoms consistent with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and stated that he was being treated with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX once a week to address these symptoms.40 Regarding mental health treatment, the objective evidence indicates that there is a shortage of XXXXand mental health workers to serve the population in India.41 This is reflected in the new evidence concerning the small pool of mental heath professionals in Telangana.42 However, the objective evidence refers to the Indian government's National Mental Health Programme to increase the availability of mental healthcare to the most vulnerable in the population. It further states that psychiatric treatment is available from public hospitals in India where treatment costs are subsidized, including for CBT, one of which is in Telangana.43 The objective evidence also indicates that mental health care is more available for those who live in urban cities, such as Hyderabad, compared to rural areas.44 Although the Appellant may experience some hardship in relocating to the proposed IFA in relation to his mental health, I find that he has not established that he will not be able to continue treatment in the proposed IFA.\n[36] Regarding education for the Appellant's children, the country condition evidence indicates that only 4.9 percent of higher education students are Muslims in India, but that the Indian government has taken steps to address this by providing scholarships to 23.7 million Muslim students in recent years.45 The Appellant testified that he would not be able to send his children to school in an IFA out of the fear that they would be discovered to be his children.46 However, as set out in my analysis of the first prong of the test, I find that the Appellant has not established that anyone would be searching for him in Hyderabad. As a result, the family would not need to live in hiding. I also find that the Appellant would be able to practice his Muslim faith in Hyderabad, which has traditionally been the heartland of Muslim culture in the south of India.47\n[37] Having considered these factors, I find that the Appellant has not met the onus to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it would be objectively unreasonable for him to relocate to Hyderabad.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nMaureen Carter-Whitney\nMaureen Carter-Whitney\nApril 6, 2022\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 6, and 11, Basis of Claim (BOC) forms, narrative and amendments, pgs. 16-51.\n3 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, pg. 13.\n4 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, pg. 14.\n5 IRPA, s. 110(4).\n6 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

His claim for refugee protection, based on his practice of Falun Gong, was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in assessing his claim and asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow his appeal and substitute a positive decision or return his claim to the RPD for redetermination.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that he fears persecution in China because of his practice of Falun Gong. He was introduced to Falun Gong by his friend XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2015, because he was suffering from XXXX after the deaths of his father and sister. He began to attend group practices in XXXX 2015. The Appellant's health improved, and his doctor confirmed that he was recovering from his XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the Appellant's group practice was raided by the police. The Appellant and his friend, XXXX XXXX, escaped by swimming across the river. The Appellant went to hide at his aunt's home. His wife contacted him by telephone the next day to tell him that the police had been to their home and had left a summons for him to appear the next day. She also advised him that his friend, XXXX XXXX, had been detained by the police. The Appellant left China with the help of a person named XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[4] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (the Minister) intervened, and provided information regarding the Appellant's stay in the United States (US) beginning in 2004, a copy of a US visa application made in 2015, and a copy of the Canadian visa application made in 2017. The Minister submitted that the information provided shows that the Appellant was fingerprinted on XXXX XXXX, 2004, upon entry into the US and again fingerprinted on XXXX XXXX, 2015, at the US consulate in Guangzhou for the purpose of a US visa application which was subsequently refused. The Minister submitted that the Appellant initially responded in the negative to question 6 (d) of the Schedule A form, which asks about previous visa refusals, and only corrected his declaration later with handwritten notes stating that he was refused a US visa in XXXX 2015. The Minister noted that the XXXX 2015 date did not match the biometric report which states that it occurred in XXXX 2015.\n[5] The Minister submitted that the Appellant also chose not to disclose to the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) or the immigration authorities that he overstayed his business visa which expired on XXXX XXXX, 2004, which was a clear violation of US immigration law. The Minister was of the opinion that the Appellant most likely misrepresented his personal information as early as 2004 for the purpose of obtaining a visa for undisclosed purposes in the US.\n[6] The Minister submitted that the fraudulent information contained in the XXXX 2015 US visa application was provided prior to the Appellant's introduction to Falun Gong in XXXX 2015. The Minister argued that there was no reason for him to lie about anything in that visa application because it was submitted before the events that caused him to flee China. The Minister additionally noted that the Appellant never declared that he used an agent or smuggler to improperly obtain any visas while he was in China before the alleged events. The Minister argued that this seriously undermined the Appellant's credibility and caused serious doubt over the genuineness of the alleged events of persecution.\n[7] The Appellant's claim for refugee protection was first heard by the RPD on February 4, 2020. The RPD rejected his claim. The Appellant's appeal of this decision to the RAD was allowed and the claim was returned to the RPD to be reheard. The claim was reheard on November 29, 2021, and in a written decision dated December 9, 2021, the RPD rejected the claim finding that the Appellant was not credible with respect to his alleged Falun Gong practice in China, and that he is not wanted by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) for his Falun Gong activities or for any other reason. The RPD further found that the Appellant had not established that he is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada or that his Falun Gong activities in Canada have come to the attention of the authorities in China.\n[8] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility and in its determination of the sur place aspect of his claim.\nANALYSIS\nVisa Applications\nRPD's Findings\n[9] The RPD found that the Appellant's credibility was undermined by his blatant disregard for both US and Canadian immigration laws. The RPD considered that he provided false information in his 2015 US visa application which was prior to when he began to practice Falun Gong in China. The RPD noted that the Appellant stated that he was unaware of what information in the application was fraudulent, and he blamed everything on the smuggler to whom he had provided his personal information and passport. The RPD noted that the Appellant initially testified that he was uncertain if there was incorrect information contained in the 2017 Canadian visa application, but after taking a break from the proceedings he acknowledged that the 2017 application contained fraudulent information.\n[10] The RPD additionally considered that the Appellant did not disclose to the immigration authorities that he had used the services of a smuggler to facilitate his journey and rejected his explanation that he had not been asked about that by the immigration authorities.\n[11] The RPD found that the Appellant was not fleeing persecution when he went to the US in 2004, or when he submitted the 2015 US visa application. The RPD commented that to blame everything on the smuggler was a complete disregard for the laws of the country to which he was entering.\nThe Appellant's Arguments\n[12] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in impugning his credibility because of his use of false information in his visa application. He submits that the specific false information contained in the visa application was not known to him. He argues that he was forthright and honest in his responses and at no point was his testimony evolving or vague. He submits that it is unreasonable to expect someone fleeing their country in fear of persecution to openly admit to immigration officers at a port of entry that they are in possession of a visitor's visa which contains false information, especially when acting on the advice of a smuggler. There is no evidence to suggest that immigration officers had asked him about the use of the smuggler and that he lied or misrepresented himself.\n[13] The Appellant submits that he did disclose in his Schedule 12 form that he had used an agent to apply for the Canadian visitor visa and the RPD erroneously impugned his credibility for not willingly disclosing this information to Canadian immigration authorities without being asked. He argues that the RPD's rejection of his explanation that he had not been asked about the use of a smuggler was based on speculation and conjecture. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by impugning his credibility on the basis of a smuggler using fraudulent information on his visa application, given that he was fleeing persecution in his country.\nRAD's Findings\n[14] I have reviewed the record and have considered the Appellant's testimony. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant was not forthcoming about his previous immigration history with the US when he entered Canada and that this undermined his general credibility. I further concur with the RPD that the use of false information when attempting to get a US visa in 2015, at a time when he was not fearing persecution, shows that the Appellant was willing and able to use fraudulent methods to achieve his goals. While these findings are not determinative of the appeal on their own, I find that when considered cumulatively with other findings, they are significant.\n[15] 2004 stay in the US: I note that when the Appellant signed his refugee intake documents on September 19, 2017, he did not include information that he had remained in the US from 2004 to 2008. What he did include was an address in the US from XXXX 2004 to XXXX 2004.1 However, it was revealed by the Minister in XXXX 2018, that the Appellant had overstayed his visa in 2004, and he admitted at the hearing that he had resided in the US without status for four years.\n[16] When asked at the hearing why he had not disclosed that he had lived in the US for four additional years, he replied that he did not want to think about history and did not know he had to write about that. He stated that when asked about it at his immigration interview, he realized it was serious and confessed to the officer that he had gone to the US in 2004, but not that he was there illegally for four years, which the officer had not asked about. However, I note that the Appellant did write in response to Question 12 of The Schedule A form2 that he resided in Chicago from XXXX 2004 to XXXX 2004, and that the information he disclosed at the interview was that he had acquired a business visa in 2004. I find that the Appellant did not reasonably explain why he purposely withheld information about his illegal four year stay in the US from Canadian immigration authorities, given that he was represented by experienced legal counsel, the contents of the form were translated to him by an interpreter, and he had signed the documents saying that the information was complete, true, and correct. I take a negative credibility inference from the Appellant purposely withholding this information.\n[17] 2015 US Visa Application: The Appellant was asked at the hearing whether the information contained in his US visa application was genuine and he replied in the negative. When asked what information in the document was not true, he replied that he did not know because the smuggler had handled everything. He was asked if he had only discovered there was false information in the visa application at the current hearing and he replied that the Member told him at his first RPD hearing that it was false. However, he also stated later in the hearing that he knew that the information contained in his visa application was false when he went for his interview at the US embassy in China. The Appellant was asked why he used false information in his 2015 visa application, and he replied that he gave the smuggler his true information.\n[18] I find that the Appellant's use of a smuggler to acquire a visa in 2015 indicates his awareness that he was not going through legal channels to acquire a visa and that this was before he allegedly began to practice Falun Gong and fear persecution in China. I have additionally considered that he initially withheld information about his 2015 visa application in his refugee intake forms, despite being specifically asked in the form whether he had ever been refused a visa to Canada or any other country. The form was completed and signed by the Appellant on September 9, 2017, and the changes were made when he was interviewed by an immigration officer on October 12, 2017. The Appellant was represented by counsel when he completed the forms and was provided with an interpreter. I find that he has not reasonably explained the initial omission of this information from the Schedule A form.\n[19] I find that the use of a smuggler when the Appellant was not fearing persecution and the omission of the information about his US visa application in 2015 negatively impact the Appellant's credibility.\nPursuit by the PSB\nRPD's Findings\n[20] The RPD found that the Appellant had not provided any credible evidence regarding the pursuit by the PSB before or after his departure. The RPD considered that there was no mention in his Basis of Claim (BOC) of the PSB continuing to pursue him after leaving a summons at his home. The RPD rejected his explanation that he did not know he needed to include this information, as he was represented by competent counsel.\nAppellant's Arguments\n[21] The Appellant argues the BOC narrative is not meant to be an exhaustive narration of everything that happened in the Appellant's life, but rather a summary of the incidents that the Appellant considered central to his claim for refugee protection. He submits that the omission of pursuit by the PSB is truly minor in nature and not central to his claim as he had already provided other supporting documentation to establish that he was wanted by the PSB, including a summons, and support letters from his wife and fellow Falun Gong practitioners. The Appellant argues that a refugee hearing is not meant to be a memory test and the focus should not be on minor inconsequential omissions.\nRAD's Findings\n[22] I find that the omission from the BOC of continued pursuit by the PSB, after they had left a summons to appear for questioning, is not minor or inconsequential. The continued pursuit of the Appellant by the PSB goes to the heart of his claim that he cannot return to China because he is wanted by the authorities.\n[23] The Appellant was questioned at the hearing about whether the PSB had returned to his home after leaving the summons on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The Appellant responded that the PSB did go to his home. When asked why there was no mention of the PSB returning to his home in his BOC narrative, he responded that they went to his home later. He was asked when, and he responded that it was in XXXX 2017. He corrected himself when it was pointed out that he had said they first came in XXXX 2017, and he stated that the PSB went to his home and left a summons with his wife in XXXX 2017. He was asked again if they returned to his home after they left a summons and he replied that they did, but he did not remember the date or how many times the PSB went to his home looking for him. He was later asked specifically whether the PSB returned to his home between the time they left a summons and when he left China in XXXX 2017, and he replied that they did. When asked again why he did not put this information in his BOC narrative, he responded that he was not aware that he needed to write it down.\n[24] I agree with the RPD that the Appellant did not reasonably explain the omission from his BOC of subsequent visits by the PSB. The Appellant was represented by experienced counsel, and I do not find it reasonable that he would not be aware that he needed to include information regarding pursuit by the agents of persecution. The continued visits by the PSB to his home are the most recent events that happened in China, and it is reasonable to expect that he would include this information in his BOC. I note as well that the Appellant provided a letter from his wife for his first hearing before the RPD.3 This letter, dated XXXX XXXX, 2017, contains no information regarding PSB visits to their home.\n[25] A more recent letter from his wife, dated XXXX XXXX, 2021,4 states that the PSB still come to her home frequently \"to search,\" ever since the Appellant came to Canada, but she does not provide any specific dates. I note that this letter does not address the period of time between when the summons was issued, and when the Appellant left China on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[26] I have considered that the Appellant did not reasonably explain the omission from his BOC regarding the PSB visits after the issuance of the summons, and that the first letter from his wife contained no information about PSB visits. Furthermore, the Appellant's testimony regarding the PSB visits contained no details other than a summons being left during the first visit. I find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the PSB returned to his home in China after issuing a summons for him to appear at the police station the next day.\n[27] I have further considered that the Appellant testified at the hearing that it was the intention of the PSB to arrest him on the day of the raid in XXXX 2017, and that his co-practitioner, who was arrested on the day of the raid, still remains in custody. Given these circumstances, as well as the Appellant's nonappearance after the issuance of a summons, and his ability to exit China, which are addressed below, I find that the Appellant has not established on a balance of probabilities, that he is wanted by the authorities in China.\n[28] I have considered that the Appellant submitted a second letter from his wife which speaks about PSB visits to their home after he left China. I assign little weight to this letter given that it contains no details about when the PSB visited, and because the Appellant has not established that the PSB were seeking him prior to his exit from China. According to the Appellant's evidence, PSB visits to his home after he left China were a continuation of the visits that had occurred prior to his exit. Having found that the PSB visits to his home prior to his exit did not occur, and because the more recent visits to the Appellant's home are linked to those occurrences, I find that little weight can be assigned to the second letter from his wife in establishing that the police continue to search for the Appellant.\nThe Summons\nRPD's Findings\n[29] The RPD found that little weight could be given to the summons in establishing that the Appellant is being pursued by the PSB. The RPD expressed concern that the stamp on the summons appears to have been written over, which caused the RPD to question the veracity of the document. However, the RPD found that even if that was not a concern, there were other aspects that undermined the genuineness of the summons. The RPD noted that the summons issued was a non-coercive investigative summons and found that it was reasonable to expect that a coercive summons would have been issued when the Appellant did not appear as required. The RPD considered that the Chinese authorities view Falun Gong practitioners as members of a cult, as well as the arrest of a fellow practitioner and the alleged follow-up visits to his home by the PSB. The RPD found that the absence of a compulsory summons, when it is reasonable to expect that the Appellant would have been issued in one, undermined the summons he did tender.\nAppellant's Arguments\n[30] The Appellant argues that the RPD impugned his credibility because the summons issued by the PSB indicated that a coercive summons would be issued if he did not appear. He submits that he was only questioned about how he obtained the summons. He submits that the RPD failed to assign appropriate weight to this key evidence showing his risk of persecution in China. Furthermore, he argues that the Federal Court has found this type of reasoning regarding the non-issuance of a coercive summons to be highly speculative and unreasonable.\nRAD's Findings\n[31] I find that the issuance of a noncoercive, investigative summons for the Appellant does not show that he is wanted for arrest by the authorities. I have considered the Appellant's particular circumstances as alleged. I note that he stated at the hearing that it was the intention of the PSB to arrest him when his group practice was raided on XXXX XXXX, 2017. He specifically testified at the hearing that they arrested him, and he escaped. Given that it was the intention of the PSB to arrest the Appellant, and a fellow practitioner has been continuously detained since the raid, I agree with the RPD that it is suspicious that the authorities would issue an investigative summons for the purpose of questioning the Appellant.\n[32] Further, the type of summons issued to the Appellant was a Public Security summons which cannot last more than twelve hours. It is noted in the country conditions documentary evidence that this type of short term detention \"is used against criminal suspects the police consider do not need to be formally arrested.\"5 Article 119 of The Criminal Procedure Law states that criminal suspects that do not need to be taken into custody or arrested may be summoned to a location in the city or county.6 According to the Appellant, he is wanted for arrest in China. I find that the type of summons issued to the Appellant does not accurately reflect this. I have considered the lack of a follow-up, coercive summons after the Appellant did not appear as required on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and the lack of credible information regarding return visits by the PSB, and I find that they are indicative of a lack of interest in the Appellant by the authorities.\n[33] I have additionally considered that Falun Gong practitioners are considered members of an evil cult and that a special Ministry of Justice office known as the 610 office, oversees the government's crackdown on Falun Gong.7 Given how the Appellant would be perceived by the Chinese government, I find it is reasonable to expect that the authorities would have used coercive measures to compel the Appellant to appear as required.\nExit from China\nRPD's Findings\n[34] The RPD found that the evidence surrounding the Appellant's passage through the airport in China was not credible as his testimony regarding the number of times he was required to show his passport was inconsistent with the country conditions documentary evidence. The RPD further considered the documentary evidence stating that Chinese citizens are not allowed to exit China if they are suspects or defendants in criminal cases, and that everyone leaving China is subject to identity controls based on the passport check. The RPD noted that the Appellant stated at the hearing that the smuggler assisted him with travel to two airports in China but did not accompany him through the airport to board the aircraft to Canada. The RPD found it significant that he was able to exit the country notwithstanding his testimony with respect to PSB pursuit, the detention of a co-practitioner, and the issuance of a summons. When considered in conjunction with the lack of evidence with respect to PSB visits, the lack of a coercive summons, and failure to establish the detention of a co-practitioner, the RPD concluded that the Appellant was not wanted by the PSB for his Falun Gong activities or for any other reason.\nAppellant's Arguments\n[35] The Appellant argues that the RPD did not state which part of his testimony was not plausible, especially considering that he had used a smuggler for his passage through the airport. He submits that he specifically testified that the smuggler accompanied him for the first leg of his trip from Hunan to Tianjin and that in the last airport before leaving for Canada, he gave the Appellant the ticket and told him to enter the gate. He testified that he did not present his passport more than once and only did so when passing through security.\n[36] The Appellant submits that the RPD relied on an unstated plausibility finding regarding his ability to fly out of an airport in China using his own identity documents. He argues that when making a plausibility finding it was not open to the RPD to prefer to rely on the objective evidence rather than his own testimony. He submits that the RPD was required to find that his exit from China while wanted by the PSB was so far outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected that it could not possibly have happened. He submits that where there is evidence of corruption it is incumbent on the RPD to explain why these factors could not have reasonably overcome the centralized system, which the RPD failed to do.\n[37] The Appellant argues that the country conditions documentary evidence notes that sources have indicated that the implementation of exit bans is arbitrary. He further argues that the documentary evidence does not specifically state that every individual boarding a departure flight in China has their personal information checked against all databases of people wanted by the PSB.\nRAD's findings\n[38] I have considered that the Appellant was able to exit China using a passport with his own name and photo, despite alleging to being wanted for arrest by the authorities. I have reviewed the documentary evidence which notes that PSB investigations require \"meticulous documentation of offenders\", and that the PSB \"specifically requires documentation, reporting, and monitoring of potential offenders\".8\n[39] I find that it is clear from the Appellant's allegations that he was wanted by the authorities for arrest. I find that the Appellant's information would have been entered into the Golden Shield database, given his particular circumstances. I find that the preponderance of the documentary evidence contained in the record indicates that it is not possible for a person who is under investigation or wanted for arrest by the authorities to exit China. I note that Article 12 of the Exit and Entry Administration Law of the People's Republic of China states that Chinese citizens are not allowed to exit China when they are suspects or defendants in criminal cases.9 It is also noted in the documentary evidence that passports and travelers are thoroughly examined by immigration and customs officials in China using advanced technology, real name online registration requirements, GPS monitoring and advanced passenger information that is submitted to Chinese authorities by the airline prior to going through exit immigration inspection procedures.10 The Appellant exited China through the airport in Beijing. Country conditions documentation notes that the Beijing International Airport has over 600 biometric checkpoints implemented throughout the airport.11 Furthermore, for outgoing flights, aviation companies must report names, nationalities, genders, dates of birth, passport or other exit-entry document numbers, expiry dates of the validity of passport or other exit-entry documents, and personnel types before the passengers and crew members on board go through the exit immigration inspection procedures.12\n[40] I note that the Golden Shield system has been used to track down Falun Gong practitioners. Country documentation indicates that:\n[...] the Chinese economist's writing in Open Magazine affirms that \"Cisco's Policenet has been helping the [Chinese Communist Party]'s public security organs to ferret out political dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners for years.\"13\nAn undated article on the website of the Ministry of Public Security, entitled \"Deepening the Implementation of the 'Golden Shield' Project,\" indicates that all police units nationwide have access to eight public security databases, including the \"National Basic Population Information Database\". Also accessible through the databases is information on household registration [hukou], border exit and entry, road traffic, and criminal investigations.14\n[41] The Appellant has alleged that he is being sought by the authorities because he is a Falun Gong practitioner. He has alleged that they were seeking to arrest him prior to his exit from China. Given that the authorities have allegedly continued to seek out the Appellant, and have detained one of his fellow practitioners, it is reasonable that they would seek to restrict the Appellant's movements as well.\n[42] I have considered the objective evidence, and the particular circumstances of the Appellant, and find that it is reasonable to believe that if he was being pursued by the PSB, as he alleges, his name would have been entered in the Golden Shield database and he would be unable to leave China. The country conditions documentary evidence notes that airport officials have access to a network which includes national and provincial level blacklists. High-profile activists are placed on the list by the Ministry of Public Security or the Ministry of State Security, while other dissidents are placed on the list by the provincial level or the city level public security bureaus or state security bureaus. It is further noted that people charged with crimes are on a separate list.15 According to the Appellant's evidence, he is wanted for his practice of Falun Gong. He has alleged that the PSB has continued to seek him out, and I find that it is reasonable in the circumstances that his name would have been placed on a list accessible by airport authorities.\n[43] While there is documentary evidence that indicates that corruption exists within the police force in China, and that authorities in China do not always apply regulations evenly, I find that the preponderance of the documentary evidence does state that authorities at borders conduct thorough screenings. I find that there is insufficient evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for China, or in the Appellant's disclosure to establish that corruption extends to the airport security apparatus, specifically relating to individuals using their own passports to leave the country.\n[44] I find that the Appellant's allegation that he was able to exit China using his own passport is inconsistent with the documentary evidence in the record. I find that it is not credible or plausible that the Appellant would be able to leave China using his own identity if he was wanted by the authorities. Furthermore, I find that the Appellant's ability to exit China undermines his central allegation that he was wanted by the PSB for practicing Falun Gong. This finding is also supported by Zeng, Su, and Cao, in which the Federal Court has supported findings that traveling unimpeded through Chinese exit controls is inconsistent with being wanted by the Chinese authorities.16\n[45] I find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he was able to exit China because a smuggler helped him to evade detection by the authorities. He testified that the smuggler did not accompany him to Canada and that the smuggler handed him his documents at the airport and advised him of which airport gate to go through. The Schedule 12 form,17 one of the refugee intake documents, asks in question 7 about the person who facilitated the journey to Canada and what was done by that person. In response, the Appellant wrote \"apply visa, and escort to Canada\". There is no information about evading airport security measures in any of the documentation provided by the Appellant or in his testimony. I find that there is insufficient evidence in the record to establish that the smuggler hired by the Appellant used bribery to facilitate his exit.\n[46] Having reviewed all the evidence, as well as the findings noted regarding other aspects of the claim, I find that the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellant was not credible regarding his ability to exit the country using his own passport and finding that he was not a person of interest to the Chinese authorities. I find his ability to exit the country using his own identity undermines his allegations that he was wanted by the authorities because of his practice of Falun Gong.\nSummary Regarding Events in China, and Travel History\n[47] I have considered my findings regarding the Appellant's history of bypassing immigration requirements and law at times when he was not at risk of persecution; that he has not established on a balance of probabilities that he is wanted by the authorities in China; and his ability to exit China despite allegedly being wanted for arrest. When considered cumulatively, I find that the RPD did not err in concluding that the Appellant had not established on a balance of probabilities, that he was a practitioner of Falun Gong in China. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant did not leave China in order to practice Falun Gong in Canada.\nFalun Gong Knowledge and Sur Place Claim\nRPD's Findings\n[48] The RPD acknowledged that the Appellant was able to respond to a few simple questions about Falun Gong put to him by his counsel but found that most of his responses to the questions asked by the panel were incorrect, incomplete, and demonstrated a lack of understanding. The RPD considered that the Appellant has 12 years of formal education and had allegedly been practising Falun Gong for a period of more than four years. The RPD found that his knowledge of Falun Gong was not commensurate with his alleged practice. The RPD considered that Falun Gong is a knowledge-based practice and that it is reasonable to expect a person who alleges to be a practitioner to be able to demonstrate a level of fundamental knowledge commensurate with his or her experience in the practice.\n[49] The RPD noted that the Appellant testified that he had begun the practice of Falun Gong in Canada in XXXX 2017, and he submitted a letter from a co-practitioner and photographs in support of his claim. The RPD found that these items did not attest to the genuineness of his Falun Gong practice. The RPD found that the Appellant had not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he was a Falun Gong practitioner in China or the genuineness of his practice in Canada.\n[50] The RPD found that there was no evidence that the Appellant's activities in Canada had come to the attention of the authorities in China. The RPD noted that there was no evidence adduced that the Appellant had any leadership roles or that he would have been identifiable. The RPD considered that there was no evidence in the record that the Appellant had participated in anything other than his group practice which had ceased in March 2020 because of COVID restrictions.\nAppellant's Arguments\n[51] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding he was never a Falun Gong practitioner in China, which led the RPD to view his sur place claim with scepticism. He submits that the RPD erred by failing to consider the totality of the evidence and importing earlier credibility findings. He submits that he provided a letter from his wife detailing the efforts of the authorities to locate him and that he is a sur place refugee as he would face a serious risk of persecution if returned to China.\n[52] The Appellant argues that not all practitioners acquire the same level of religious knowledge within the same amount of time, and that practice duration is not an accurate benchmark to gauge the amount of religious knowledge. He submits that his responses to knowledge questions were entirely genuine and spontaneous and not in need of much prompting. He submits that he provided numerous reasons why he continues to practice and will continue to practice if returned to China, but the RPD found this to be insufficient.\nRAD's Findings\n[53] I have reviewed the record and note that the Appellant did have some knowledge of Falun Gong practice and philosophy. However, having found that the Appellant was not a practitioner of Falun Gong in China, I must consider whether the Appellant is a genuine practitioner in this country. The Appellant has alleged that his motivation to practice Falun Gong in Canada took place as a result of his practice in China. He has alleged that his practice of Falun Gong in Canada is a continuation of his Falun Gong practice in China.\n[54] I have found that the Appellant was not a practitioner of Falun Gong in China and having no evidence of an impetus to practice in Canada, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant has engaged in Falun Gong activities and has learned about the practice in Canada only for the purpose of supporting a fraudulent refugee claim. I find, based on the totality of the credibility findings previously noted, the Appellant is not presently a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong and that he would not engage in Falun Gong activities should he return to China.\n[55] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant has acquired knowledge of Falun Gong and has attended Falun Gong group practice in the past to advance a claim for refugee protection. I agree with the RPD that the letter from a fellow practitioner and the photographs18 can only attest to his participation, but not to his motivation. In this regard, case law19 indicates that, when finding that the Appellant has advanced a fraudulent claim of being a Falun Gong practitioner in China, the RPD can reasonably reject evidence advanced to support the sur place claim. I give little evidentiary weight to these documents in assessing the genuineness of the Appellant's belief system and practice. I also give little evidentiary weight to the Appellant's supporting documents in assessing the genuineness of his Falun Gong practice. As noted earlier, I have found that little weight can be assigned to the second letter from the Appellant's wife for the reasons identified in establishing that the PSB continues to seek out the Appellant.\n[56] Having conducted my own assessment of the record, I find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that his Falun Gong activities in Canada have or will bring him to the attention of Chinese authorities. I find that the likelihood that he would practice Falun Gong should he return to China is minimal, given the finding that he is not a genuine practitioner.\nCONCLUSION\n[57] I find that there is not a serious possibility that the Appellant would be persecuted, should he return to China, nor would he be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should he return to China.\n[58] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nL.

Motifs et d\u00e9cision\nPerson who is the subject of the appeal\nXXXX XXXX\nPersonne en cause\nDate of decision\nAugust 29, 2022\nDate de la d\u00e9cision\nPanel\nMiriam McLeod\nTribunal\nCounsel for the person who is the subject of the appeal\nMarvin M Moses\nConseil de la personne en cause\nDesignated representative\nN\/A\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of Gambia who fears persecution in this country at the hands of the Horreh group of the Serahule (aka Soninke) tribe due to his race and political opinion as part of the Komo group of the Serahule tribe.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellant's claim for refugee protection because it found that he failed to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities and failed to provide reasonable explanations for the lack of documentation as well as for not taking reasonable steps to obtain such documentation.\n[3] The appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding that he did not establish his identity since, even if it was obtained improperly, he submitted a genuine Gambian passport. He argues that the RPD also erred in failing consider his personal circumstances - as a person who (i) is from an underclass in the Gambia that is akin to slave-status, (ii) is essentially uneducated aside from studying the Koran, and (iii) comes from a basic, simple life in a small village and was never permitted to travel outside of it until his flight to Canada - in its assessment of his explanations for not having certain identity documents. Finally, he argues that the RPD erred in assessing his identity through its own worldview.\n[4] While the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) finds that the RPD committed certain errors in its analysis, it did not err in concluding that the appellant did not establish his identity on a balance of probabilities. The RPD was correct in finding (a) that the passport on file was not a reliable identity document in light of the misspelled first name and his inconsistent testimony about when, how and why he obtained it, and (b) that he failed to submit a national ID card or birth certificate and did not provide reasonable explanations for the lack of these documents nor for not taking reasonable steps to try to obtain them. The RAD finds that the RPD's conclusion that the appellant's written declarations, testimony and the other documents submitted into evidence before the RPD were not sufficient to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities was also correct and the RAD agrees.\nDECISION\n[5] The RAD dismisses the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The appellant has presented four documents to the RAD.1 According to section 110(4) of the IRPA, the RAD can only accept evidence that:\ni. arose after the RPD decision; or\nii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii. that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\nIf the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, the RAD must then decide if the evidence also meets the adapted Raza criteria of newness, credibility, and relevance before it can be admitted as new evidence.2\n1. Affidavit of XXXX XXXX;3\n[7] The RAD finds that the affidavit repeats the appellant's allegations as outlined in his narrative at paragraphs 1-21, reiterates some of his testimony before the RPD at paragraph 22 and presents some arguments about the RPD decision at paragraph 25. This information is not new. However, the RAD finds that the appellant provided explanations in paragraph 23 that were not presented to the RPD at the hearing and are therefore new, but for which he has not explained why they could not reasonably have been given to the RPD prior to the decision being rendered. The affidavit also provides explanations, in accordance with section 3(3)(g)(iii) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules4 for how the new evidence meets the requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA at paragraph 26. As such, the RAD finds that most of the affidavit is not new evidence and considers it part of the appeal record but does not admit the new information included in paragraph 23 since the appellant has not provided any explanation in accordance with article 3(3)(g)(iii)5 for why it could not be presented to the RPD prior to the decision.\n2. \"XXXX,\" Wikipedia, accessed 13 April 2022;6\n[8] The appellant acknowledges that this document pre-dates the RPD decision, but argues that this article shows geographical information about the village where he lived in The Gambia and speaks to whether it was reasonable for the RPD to impute a level of sophistication to him since he lived in an undeveloped rural area.7 The RAD finds that this document was both available at the time of the hearing and predates the RPD decision, since it indicates that it was last edited on 16 July 2021 - more than five months prior to the RPD hearing. The article does not meet the requirements of section 110(4) IRPA, so the RAD cannot admit it.8\n3. Birth Certificate for XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX 2021;9 and\n4. Authentication of Birth Certificate of XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX 2021.10\n[9] While the birth certificate and authentication document pre-date the RPD decision, the appellant asserts that he provided a reasonable explanation for not providing them earlier11 - namely, he sent an email to his former counsel but failed to attach these documents because he lacks understanding of email technology so his counsel did not forward them to the RPD before the deadline, and he only discovered this when he received the negative decision.12 He argues that the RAD has a certain degree of inherent discretion in its application of the condition that he could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring the evidence to the RPD before the decision under section 110(4) IRPA.13\n[10] The RAD finds that these documents predate the RPD decision, were reasonably available at the time of the decision, and that the appellant has not provided sufficient information to justify why he could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring the evidence to the RPD before the decision. First, the appellant did not indicate how he received these documents. Second, he did not provide the RAD with a copy of the email he sent to his former counsel on XXXX XXXX 2021. The RAD finds it reasonable to expect that counsel would follow up when they receive an email about documents, but where none are attached. Added to this, the RPD subsequently sent a notice to former counsel extending the deadline for documents from 5 January to 12 January 2022.14 The RAD finds it reasonable to expect that former counsel would have informed him of the extended deadline. The RAD finds that in the absence of (i) a copy of the email sent to counsel and (ii) counsel incompetence allegations, the appellant has provided insufficient explanations to justify his failure to provide the documents prior to the RPD decision. Indeed, the decision was rendered on 23 February 2022 - over a month after the extended deadline for providing these documents passed and close to two months after he emailed his former counsel without attaching the documents. The RAD therefore finds that these documents do not meet the requirements of section 110(4) IRPA.\n[11] In the alternative, even if these documents did meet the requirements of section 110(4) IRPA, the RAD also has concerns regarding the source and circumstances in which these documents came into existence. The appellant has not explained how the documents were obtained nor how he received them, and the RAD notes that the authentication document is predicated on the birth certificate. He testified at the hearing about his previous efforts to obtain the birth certificate, explaining that (i) his mother had tried but probably was unable to get it due to the slavery situation and the fact that they are Komo meant that they were not highly regarded,15 and (ii) he asked his father's friend (the person who he indicates, on appeal, helped him to obtain these documents16 - the same person who he testified had obtained his Gambian passport without providing any of the documents described in the country condition documentation as required to obtain passports17) to get it but that he was also unable to.18 The RAD finds that, in the circumstances, the appellant should have included in his appeal an explanation of how these documents were obtained. Added to this, the birth certificate indicates that his birth was registered on the same date the document indicates that it was extracted from the Register-XXXX XXXX 202119-despite his testimony that he previously had a birth certificate, in which case his birth could not have been registered on the same date it was extracted if the extraction was based on an existing file.20 Further, while insufficient in itself to undermine the document, the word \"certificate\" is misspelled four out of the eight times it appears on the authentication document,21 which is written in Gambia's official language and on paper with The Republic of Gambia letterhead.22 The RAD cannot admit these documents on appeal.\nORAL HEARING\n[12] The appellant requests that the RAD hold a hearing.23 Section 110(6) outlines the criteria that must be met for the RAD to hold a hearing and all are predicated on the admission of new evidence. Since the RAD has not admitted any new evidence, it cannot hold a hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[13] The RAD must conduct a thorough, complete, and independent assessment of the record in light of the appellant's arguments on appeal. The RAD has listened to the recording of the hearing before the RPD and has applied the standard of correctness in the present case.24\nIdentity\n[14] \"Identity\" refers to the personal identity of the refugee protection claimant (name, date of birth) as well as their national identity. Establishing national identity without having established personal identity is not sufficient in refugee determination proceedings.25 The onus rests on the appellant to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities,26 and failure to prove identity is fatal to a claim in and of itself.\n[15] The RPD found that the appellant did not establish his identity on a balance of probabilities, based on its analysis of the following:\nGambian Passport\n[16] The RPD gave no weight to the Gambian passport.27 It noted that the appellant declared having travelled to Canada on a false French passport given to him by an agent. It noted that his name is spelled \"XXXX XXXX\" in the passport, but that he declared his name was \"XXXX XXXX\" on all his immigration forms. It did not accept his explanation that he spelled his name \"XXXX\" in the immigration forms because that is how he spells his name in his email address because it was reasonable to expect claimants to provide their legal names on formal documents even if they use a different spelling for their email address.28\n[17] The RPD further found that his testimony about how, when, and why he got the passport was vague and inconsistent. The RPD did not accept his explanation for why his passport was issued in XXXX 2018 because it was inconsistent with his allegations - he alleged that his father's friend obtained it for him because of the problems he faced in The Gambia, but the problems he faced occurred in XXXX 2018. Added to this, while his passport was issued in XXXX 2018, he testified to giving the friend his photo in XXXX 2018. It also noted that his passport included an electronically embedded signature, meaning that he had to be involved in its acquisition in XXXX 2018. It concluded that his vague and inconsistent testimony undermined the reliability of the passport, and it drew a negative credibility inference. The RPD found that the reliability of the passport was also undermined because he testified that his father's friend obtained the passport for him, but that he did not give him any documents to apply for the passport whereas the country condition documentation indicates the appellant would have been required to appear in person and provide supporting documents to obtain the passport. The RPD, therefore, did not accept that the appellant's family friend obtained a genuine passport for him without his birth certificate, national ID card, or voter card and that his failure to submit supporting documents of this nature further undermined the reliability of the passport.29\n[18] The appellant argues that the RPD's expectation that he provides his legal name exactly as written on legal documents in his immigration forms presupposes that a person is sufficiently educated to understand the importance of presenting their legal name exactly as it should be written. He also points out that he was helped in filling out the forms by an interpreter and the sound of \"XXXX\" and \"XXXX\" would not have been evident. He asserts that given his limited sophistication, lack of education, and background as Komo living in a small village where he worked on a farm for his master from the age of 12, it is reasonable that he was unable to explain how his family friend applied for the passport. He also argues that, if his name were not misspelled in the immigration forms, the issue of identity would not have been raised.30\n[19] The RAD notes at the outset that the appellant (i) declared in his narrative that he travelled to Canada with a \"false passport of France\",31 and had a Gambian passport that was seized when he applied for refugee protection in Canada, (ii) the Gambian passport indicated his name is \"XXXX\" whereas he declared his name to be \"XXXX\" in his immigration forms,32 and (iii) he declared having used another name \"XXXX XXXX\" in his IMM 0008 form33. Added to this, at the time of his hearing before the RPD, he did not submit any other government-issued identity documents. The RAD finds that these elements formed a sufficient basis for the RPD to have concerns about his identity and that it is likely that this combination of elements - not merely the misspelling of his first name in the Gambian passport - that raised identity concerns for the RPD. The RAD also notes that the RPD drew no negative credibility findings due to his use of a false passport to come to Canada or from his use of another name. Further, his testimony at the hearing added to the concerns regarding the reliability of the passport in establishing his identity.\n[20] The RAD finds that the RPD did not err in deciding to give no weight to the Gambian passport in establishing the appellant's identity nor in drawing a negative credibility finding due to his inconsistent testimony about when, why, and how he obtained the passport. The appellant testified that he told his father's friend his full name and date of birth but gave the friend no other documentation,34 provided him with an old photograph of himself that he had in his bag at the time,35 and asserts that he signed the passport where his father's friend instructed him to sign.36\n[21] With respect to the misspelling of his name, the RAD agrees with the appellant that, given his limited education and background, it is unlikely that he would have known to provide his exact legal name on formal documents. However, the RAD agrees with the RPD that his explanation for misspelling his name makes little sense since nowhere in the documentation does it ask for his email address nor did he provide it anywhere in those forms, and he did not indicate that he did not know how to spell his own name correctly. Added to this, his explanation indicates that his choice of spelling was intentional, so the RAD does not accept the argument regarding the possible error resulting from the verbal interpretation of \"XXXX\" versus \"XXXX\" provided on appeal. As such, the RAD agrees with the RPD that he did not provide a sufficient explanation for having misspelled his name in all his immigration forms37 - and the RAD notes that the same error also appears in the amended narrative he submitted via former counsel subsequent to the immigration forms.38 Nonetheless, the inconsistency in the spelling of his name was not the only reliability concern in relation to the passport given his inconsistent testimony regarding when, why, and how his passport was issued, that is addressed in the following paragraphs.\n[22] The RAD notes that the Appellant does not contest the RPD's finding that his testimony for when and why he obtained the passport was inconsistent. The RAD finds no error and agrees with the RPD. The Appellant alleged that he fled XXXX after an altercation he had with the son of a Horreh superior in XXXX 2018, and fled to his father's friend in XXXX.39 He testified that he told his father's friend what had happened, that the friend obtained his passport for him.40 Since Appellant's problems occurred in XXXX 2018 and the passport was issued in XXXX 2018, the RAD agrees that the Appellant's testimony for why he obtained the passport is inconsistent with the chronology of his allegations, thereby undermining his explanation for the timing of its issuance. The RAD also notes that, since the passport was issued in XXXX 2018, his testimony that he gave his father's friend his photograph and signed the passport in XXXX 2018 is also inconsistent, particularly since the signature in the passport is electronically embedded. The RAD also agrees with the RPD that this inconsistent testimony undermined his credibility.\n[23] Second, the RAD finds no error and agrees with the RPD that the appellant's testimony about how the passport was obtained is inconsistent with the country condition documentation on how passports are issued in The Gambia. The documentation states that \"Gambian citizens must appear in person to have their biometric features captured\".41 The documentation further indicates that:\nThe application must be submitted at one of the Immigration Department's enrolment offices in XXXX with the following supporting documents:\n* Payment confirmation\n* Identity card\n* Voter's card\n* Copy of birth certificate or a certificate signed by the village chief (Alkalo) or by district chief (Seylo) declaring that the applicant was born in their village\/district\n* Old passport (in renewal cases)\n* Gambians below 18 years must submit a birth certificate, signed by the Alkalo or Seyfo and their parents' identity documents.\n* The price of a biometric passport is XXXX XXXX XXXX dalasis (approximately XXXX USD).\nThe biometric data captured is the applicant's fingerprints, the applicant's signature and information regarding the applicant's irises. The information is stored in a RFID tag (radio frequency identification) embedded in the document.42\nHowever, the appellant testified that his father's friend obtained his passport with only his full name and date of birth but no other documentation,43 aside from giving him an old photograph he had in his bag,44 and signing the passport as instructed by the friend.45 The RAD prefers the objective country condition documentation regarding how to obtain a Gambian passport over the appellant's testimony, given the credibility concerns raised by his inconsistent explanation for when and why he obtained a Gambian passport and in light of his declaration that he did not know how the friend could have obtained the passport without providing the documents normally required to obtain it. The RAD, therefore, finds that the RPD did not err when it concluded that the passport was not a reliable identity document.\n[24] Finally, the RAD cannot accept the appellant's argument that, given the corruption in The Gambia and despite the laws suggesting that the applications be made in person, the passport may have been obtained improperly but is nonetheless a legal and genuine document.46 The appellant presented the passport to the RPD as a valid identity document and did not allege before the RPD that his passport was obtained improperly, nor did he provide any evidence from the friend who obtained it confirming that it was obtained it improperly. However, even if the passport was obtained improperly, the RAD finds that a passport that is obtained improperly cannot serve to establish one's identity even if it is genuine, because the proper verification procedure for its issuance was not followed. If the appellant's passport was obtained improperly, his identity was not properly proven to the Gambian authorities prior to its issuance and therefore cannot be relied upon to establish his identity.\nGambian National ID Card\n[25] The RPD drew a negative inference regarding the appellant's identity because he stated he does not have a national ID card and did not accept his explanation for his lack of such a card. It noted his testimony that he does not have an ID aside from his passport, and that it is not mandatory by law to have a national ID card unless you want to travel outside of the country. However, the RPD found that the country condition documentation indicates that Gambian citizens are required to have a national ID card and can be punished if they do not. It also noted that he could not have obtained a passport without a national ID card.47\n[26] The Appellant argues that the RPD ignored the fact that he is a member of an underclass and the Komo may or may not have followed proper government protocols, including applying for national ID cards when they reach 18 years old. He reiterates his testimony that he never applied for one and that it is not required unless one travels outside the country. He also argues that given his personal background - being Komo in a small village, having very limited education, and having worked on a farm since the age of 12 - he would not necessarily have obtained the ID document because that is what one is supposed to do.48\n[27] The RAD finds that the RPD was correct when it found that the documentation in the NDP about the national ID card clearly indicates that Gambian citizens over the age of 18 are required to carry one at all times and can be punished with a fine or imprisonment if they violate the law.49 It is clearly mandatory, not merely something one is merely \"supposed to do\", and not having it has consequences. The RAD finds that it prefers the country condition documentation over the appellant's testimony in this regard since he himself acknowledges on appeal that he and his family were not concerned with documentation, nor did they know how to obtain documentation.50 Nonetheless, the RAD notes in this regard that when it became necessary for the appellant to get documentation - for example, a passport to leave the country - he was nonetheless able to obtain it by reaching out to his connections.\n[28] The RAD further finds that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant did not provide a sufficient explanation for his lack of national ID card. The appellant explained that he did not have the national ID card because he did not go anywhere and it is not mandatory in the Gambia, unless you travel outside the country.51 Later, when asked about his lack of ID documents more generally, he testified that he could not leave the town where he lived without permission from the master for whom he worked, so they did not need documents and could not get documents because they could not leave.52 However, the RPD only appears to consider his declaration that he did not have the national ID card and did not need one since he had nowhere to go and that it was not mandatory.53 As such, the RAD agrees with the appellant that the RPD failed to consider the explanation regarding his personal circumstances and background in its analysis.\n[29] While the appellant explained that he could not obtain the national ID card in The Gambia due to his background and resulting inability to leave his village without permission, the RAD notes that the appellant did eventually leave his village in XXXX 2018 and lived in XXXX with the family friend until he left The Gambia to come to Canada in XXXX 2019. According to his own explanation, he would have required the national ID card to travel outside The Gambia. Added to this, while he asserts on appeal that the Komo may not have followed proper government protocols regarding national ID cards due to their status, he provided no country condition evidence to the RPD - nor to the RAD on appeal - to support his position about the Komo group and whether they follow government protocols. The RAD did not find any information in this regard in the NDP either.\n[30] Finally, the RAD finds that the appellant's explanations deal with his reasons for not having a national ID card while in The Gambia, however, they do not explain why he did not attempt to obtain one or why he was otherwise unable to obtain one once in Canada, prior to the RPD hearing or the subsequent decision. To this end, the RAD notes that (i) the RPD hearing was held over two years after he arrived in Canada, (ii) the appellant testified that he is in contact with his mother who still lives in XXXX on a regular basis,54 (iii) he was represented by counsel in the preparation of and hearing of his claim and that same counsel undertook to help him post-hearing to obtain further identity documentation within the deadline provided by the RPD at the hearing.55 The documentation in the NDP indicates that:\nThe identity card is issued by the Gambian Immigration Department. In order to apply for a national identity card, Gambian citizens must submit an application form along with a birth certificate or any other old identity document such as passport, a voter's card, a registration\/naturalisation card or, in alternative, an attestation issued by the chief of the district (Seyfo) or the village (Alkalo). A police report shall be attached to the application in case the previous card is lost or stolen.56\nThere are several options for documents to submit in support of the application. Added to this, another document in the NDP indicates that \"Gambian citizens are also able to apply for a national identity card through Gambian diplomatic missions abroad.\"57 However, the appellant has provided no evidence to the RAD of any attempts to obtain this document. From the foregoing, the RAD finds that the appellant has not provided a sufficient explanation to justify the lack of this document or for not taking reasonable steps to obtain this document.\nBirth Certificate\n[31] The RPD drew a negative inference with respect to the appellant's identity because of his lack of a Gambian birth certificate. It noted his testimony that (i) he previously had a birth certificate but that his mother told him it had been torn and destroyed, and (ii) he did not try to get another copy himself, but that his mother told him his date of birth. It noted his explanation that he did not get another one because he asked his mother a few times, that every time she said that she would try, but that the situation in the country and the slavery issue meant that they are not highly regarded and so she probably tried but could not get one. However, it did not accept his explanation that his family members or connections could not get another copy of his birth certificate since his mother and a family friend were able to get other documents for him - including his father's death certificate and send him affidavits.58\n[32] The appellant argues on appeal that given that his family and his father's friend are Komo, they would not have understood the importance of getting another copy of his birth certificate. He argues that RPD's reliance on the evidence that his mother and a family friend were able to get his father's death certificate and send him affidavits was an error because they involve different processes. Added to which, given his personal background - being Komo, having very limited education, having worked on a farm since the age of 12 - he would not necessarily have obtained an identity document because that is what one is supposed to do and that since the masters controlled most aspects of their lives, having identity documents was not a high priority for him or his family.59\n[33] The RAD finds that the RPD did not err in drawing a negative inference regarding his identity because of the lack of a birth certificate. The appellant testified that his mother previously had his birth certificate, but that it was destroyed.60 He testified that he himself made no effort to obtain a birth certificate.61 Instead, he testified that he asked his mother who said that she would try, but he asserted that the situation in the country and the slavery issue meant that they are not highly regarded and so she probably tried but could not get one.62 However, the RAD finds that this amounts to speculation - he did not testify that his mother told him that this was the reason she was unable to obtain it. He also testified that he asked his father's friend to get it, but told him he could not and that it would be easier to obtain it from his village.63 The RAD also notes that the documentation in the NDP indicates that local registrars register births and deaths and that the documents are archived locally, with entries made by hand, and that the local registrars perform \"certification and other tasks\" for which they are in contact with the Registrar of Births and Deaths in XXXX.64 The RAD finds that the appellant has provided no evidence to support his assertion that his mother and family friend were unlikely to be able to obtain his birth certificate because they are Komo or that his mother would have had to leave the village given that there are local registrars, and finds nothing in the NDP to corroborate those assertions either. The RAD, therefore, finds that this also amounts to speculation, as the appellant testified to never having attempted to obtain identity documents himself and provided no details about the efforts made by his mother and family friend to obtain his birth certificate on his behalf. The RAD finds that his explanation that they were unable to obtain a birth certificate despite his mother having previously obtained one for him is insufficient to justify the lack of birth certificate in his case and given that registrars are situated locally.\n[34] As an aside, the RAD also notes that the country condition documentation indicates that the Gambian authorities also accept certificates or statements from Alkalo or Seyfo's of villages attesting that the person identified was born in their village or district in lieu of birth certificates and to obtain other official identity documents.65 The RAD considers that obtaining such a statement would not require displacement from their village.\n[35] Further, the RAD finds that the RPD did not err in considering the evidence that his mother and family friend were able to obtain other documents on his behalf. While it is true that obtaining those documents involves different procedures, the RAD notes that his mother, who is also Komo, nonetheless was able to travel to XXXX to have her statement signed by a commissioner of oaths,66 despite the appellant's assertion that they were not allowed to leave the village and that requesting permission to obtain documents would be met with suspicion. Added to this, the appellant testified that his father's friend obtained his father's death certificate, which the documentation indicates requires medical confirmation of the death, including details of the cause of death, and confirmation from the Alkalo, and despite the indication that \"registration of deaths is not common in The Gambia.\"67\nOther Documents and Statements\n[36] The RPD found that the other documents submitted by the appellant were not acceptable evidence of his identity. It found that (i) his father's death certificate did not establish their family relationship nor the appellant's identity, and (ii) the affidavits were not accompanied by their identity documents, were not meant to corroborate his identity, and were not acceptable evidence of identity.68\n[37] The appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding that the other documents he provided could not be used to establish his identity and in failing to note that both affidavits were signed before a commissioner of oaths who can reasonably be assumed to have confirmed their identities. The appellant asserts that the affidavits establish that he lived and grew up in The Gambia. He also points to jurisprudence indicating that such documents can be relevant to the determination of identity.69\n[38] The RAD finds that the RPD erred on this point since the other documents submitted by the appellant did not have to be submitted for the purpose of corroborating his identity for them to help to establish his identity. The appellant's father's friend's affidavit provides his national ID number along with his name and date of birth, which the RAD finds to indicate that the commissioner for oaths verified his identity when preparing the affidavit.70 As such, the RPD erred in discounting it for that reason. On the other hand, the RAD notes that the mother's statement was signed before the same commissioner of oaths as the affidavit from the father's friend,71 but does not include an indication that her identity was verified. As such, the RAD finds that the mother's statement cannot be afforded full weight due to the lack of accompanying identity documents.\n[39] The RAD finds that the father's friend's affidavit has some weight insofar as it corroborates some aspects of the appellant's alleged identity. It corroborates that he lived with the Appellant in The Gambia and that his name is \"XXXX XXXX\".72 The RAD finds that the same affidavit corroborates the appellant's declaration in his narrative that his father is \"XXXX XXXX\",73 and the death certificate on the record has weight in confirming his declaration that his father, XXXX XXXX, died in the Gambia in XXXX 2018.74 The RAD accepts that the mother's statement corroborates that the appellant's name is \"XXXX\" and that his father is \"XXXX XXXX\".75 However, none of these documents serves to corroborate that the appellant is a Gambian citizen nor his alleged date of birth.\nFailure to Obtain Other Acceptable Documents\n[40] The RPD found that the appellant did not provide reasonable explanations for the lack of reliable identity documents and that he did not make reasonable efforts to obtain reliable documents. It found that he was able to leave his village to go to XXXX and obtain a passport (even if the details of how he obtained it are unclear) and that he also previously had a birth certificate, which illustrates that he was previously able to obtain identity documents in The Gambia - indeed, he was able to obtain a death certificate and affidavits. The RPD further noted that he was given additional time post-hearing to submit acceptable documentation and that the deadline was even extended, but he did not provide documents nor any reasonable explanations for the lack thereof.76\n[41] The appellant reiterates his testimony that he is uneducated, of limited literacy, that being Komo means that the normal rules do not apply and that he was beholden to a master which prevented him from having the freedom to obtain documentation or do other things of his choosing. With respect to the voter card, he argues that he provided a reasonable explanation - namely that he was not allowed to leave his village without permission so there was no means of getting one. He argues that the RPD imposed its own worldview rather than the evidence and testimony from the appellant's perspective which led it to draw unreasonable findings as a result.77\n[42] The RAD finds that, while the RPD made specific reference to the voter card, there is no information in the NDP for The Gambia regarding the voter card or the means to obtain it and the appellant testified that he did not have one and never did. As such, the RAD accepts the appellant's explanation for not having a voter card as sufficient in the circumstances. Nonetheless, the RAD finds that the RPD did not err in finding that the appellant did not provide reasonable explanations for the lack of reliable identity documents - particularly a birth certificate and national ID card. Both he and his mother were able to leave their village and obtain documents - the appellant went to XXXX and obtained a passport even though how he obtained it remains unclear, and his mother went to XXXX to make a formal statement for his refugee claim. Indeed, the RAD agrees that the fact he previously held a birth certificate implies that he could obtain another and his explanation for why his mother could not amounts to conjecture since he provided no documentary evidence to the RPD or RAD supporting this assertion nor is there any country condition documentation on the record indicating that Komo are unable or otherwise tend not to obtain identity documents. As such, the RAD finds that the RPD did not impose its own worldview, it had no country condition evidence before it that supported his assertions. Added to this, the documentation in the NDP indicates that he could have applied for a Gambian national ID document from abroad, and that, even if he could not provide a birth certificate, there is an option of obtaining documentation in lieu of a birth certificate - namely a statement from Alkalo or Seyfo's of the village. Finally, the RAD agrees with the RPD that, given that he was given additional time post-hearing - from 6 December 2021 to 5 January 2022 and then an additional week until 12 January 2022 - the fact that he did not provide any further documentation or explanations for his inability to do so despite the additional time reinforces the conclusion that he did not take reasonable steps to obtain reliable identity documentation, particularly since government-issued photo identification is available in The Gambia. As such, the RAD agrees with the RPD that the Appellant has not established his identity on a balance of probabilities.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] After considering (i) the appellant's written statements and testimony, (ii) the documents he submitted, and (iii) his failure to provide reasonable explanations for (a) his failure to submit at the very least a national ID card or birth certificate and (b) for not taking reasonable steps to obtain documentation establishing his identity, the RAD comes to the conclusion that the RPD did not err in ultimately concluding that the appellant has not succeeded in establishing his identity on a balance of probabilities, and the RAD agrees with that conclusion.\nDECISION\n[44] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMiriam McLeod\nMiriam McLeod\n29 August 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, pp. 17-29.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

At age nine, the Principal Respondent fled Iran with her family due to the risk of danger from the regime in Iran. Once in the Netherlands, the Principal Respondent's father became a drug addict and the Principal Respondent's mother left with the Principal Respondent and her brother. The Principal Respondent's father's family harassed the Principal Respondent's mother to reunite with her father. When the Associate Respondent was born out of wedlock, the father's family, which has connections with the Iranian government including its intelligence service, began to threaten the Respondents with maiming and death.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Principal Respondent was a credible witness and believed her allegations. It considered both Iran and the Netherlands as countries of reference and found that state protection was not available for the Respondents in either Iran or the Netherlands. The Minister (Appellant) is appealing the RPD decision solely with respect to the availability of state protection in the Netherlands.\n[4] The Appellant states there is new documentary evidence, but has not requested an oral hearing. The Respondents have provided a response that, in addition to providing new evidence, claims that their former counsel was not competent. The Respondents have not requested an oral hearing.\n[5] The determinative issue in the appeal is state protection in the Netherlands.\nDECISION\n[6] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Respondents are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nPRELIMINARY MATTER - ALLEGATION OF INCOMPETENCE OF FORMER COUNSEL\n[7] The Respondents allege that their former counsel was incompetent and have filed a complaint1 with the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council. The Appellant submits that the Respondents have failed to demonstrate that former counsel was ineffective.\n[8] I agree with the Appellant. In Nwafor Ep Antoine Sayegh2, the Federal Court affirmed that \"the party making the allegation of incompetence must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would be different\".\n[9] In the case at bar, the RPD found that the Respondents were Convention refugees, the most favourable outcome for claimants at an RPD proceeding. In the appeal, the Appellant's sole argument is that there is no legal basis for the RPD to conclude that state protection was unavailable to the Respondents. The Appellant has not made any arguments regarding the credibility of the Respondents or the genuine nature of any of the evidence before the RPD. There is nothing before me that suggests that their former counsel caused the Respondents any prejudice at the RPD.\n[10] I find that the Respondents have failed to demonstrate that, but for their former counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the RPD proceeding would be different.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[11] Although the Appellant states that he is relying on new evidence, I could find none in either the Appellant Record or the Appellant Reply.\n[12] The Respondents have submitted evidence in response to the appeal.\nSome of the evidence presented by the Respondents is accepted\n[13] According to the Law,3 I can only accept evidence from the Respondents that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the Respondents could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[14] The Law4 also provides that the above does not apply in respect of evidence that is presented in response to evidence presented by the Appellant.\n[15] Since the Appellant has, in fact, not presented any evidence, I find that subsection 110(5) is not engaged and therefore the Respondents must demonstrate that one of the situations in subsection 110(4) applies.\n[16] If the evidence meets any the statutory requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant (the Singh\/Raza factors) before I can accept it.5\nEvidence related to the allegation of incompetence of former counsel\n[17] The Respondents have provided many pages of documents6 related to their allegation of incompetence of their former counsel. I find that the Respondents could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring this information to the RPD before its decision, and therefore meets the statutory requirement for new evidence. Turning to the Singh\/Raza factors, as I have already dealt with this issue as a preliminary matter, I find that these documents are not relevant in the appeal and do not accept them into evidence.\nStatement from Principal Respondent's mother7\n[18] This statement is dated July 19, 2021, which is after the RPD decision. However, except for paragraph 11, information in the statement relates to events that occurred prior to the RPD decision and was reasonably available at the time of the RPD decision. However, the Respondents could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring this information to the RPD before its decision. I find that the statement meets the statutory requirement for new evidence. Turning to the Singh\/Raza factors, although the statement is not sworn and no identification document is provided, I have no reason to doubt the credibility of the statement. However, paragraphs 1-6 of the statement repeat information regarding the Respondents' situation that is already before me and not in dispute and therefore not new. Paragraphs 7-11 relate to the allegation of incompetence of former counsel, which is not relevant in the appeal. I do not accept the statement into evidence.\nStatement of Principal Respondent8\n[19] The Principal Respondent has provided a statement that repeats some of the facts of the Respondents' situation and provides additional information regarding her interactions with their former counsel. Even if I were to find that the statement met the statutory requirement for new evidence, I find that the portion of the statement repeating the facts of the Respondents' situation fails the Singh\/Raza factor of newness as these facts are not in dispute in the appeal. Similarly, I find that the portion of the statement regarding the interactions with former counsel fails the Singh\/Raza factor of relevance. I do not accept the statement into evidence.\nAffidavit of XXXX XXXX and Partial Transcripts of RPD hearings9\n[20] This affidavit is July 20, 2021, which is after the RPD decision, but simply introduces the partial transcription of the RPD hearings of February 3, 2021, and March 1, 2021. Although I have already considered the affidavit and partial transcripts as they relate to the Respondents' allegation of former counsel incompetence, for completeness I will consider them on their own. The full transcripts of the RPD hearing are already before me as Exhibits RPD-2 and RPD-3 and therefore the affidavit and partial transcripts fail the Singh\/Raza factor of newness. I do not accept the affidavit and partial transcripts into evidence.\nPolice report PL0900-20151531 9-110\n[21] This report was made by the Principal Respondent on XXXX XXXX XXXX2015, which pre-dates the RPD decision. I also find that the report was reasonably available at the time of the RPD decision. The Respondents did provide another police report11 to the RPD that references this report and therefore I find that the Respondents could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring this report to the RPD before its decision. The report meets the statutory requirement. Turning to the Singh\/Raza factors, I have no reason to doubt the credibility of the report, it is relevant to the appeal, and it is new in the sense that it tends to refute the Appellant's submission. I accept the report into evidence.\nVarious email messages12\n[22] Some of these messages (pages 68, 69 and 75 of the Respondent Record) are already before me as part of the RPD Record. The remaining emails all pre-date, and were reasonably available prior to, the RPD decision. However, it was reasonable for the Respondents to assume that providing three of the emails was sufficient to establish the lack of State protection, given that the RPD did not challenge the Principal Respondent's testimony at the hearing. As the RPD rendered its positive decision orally at the hearing, the Respondents had no opportunity (or reason) to request for time to submit additional documents. For these reasons, I find that the Respondents could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring the additional emails to the RPD before its decision. The additional emails meet the statutory requirement. Turning to the Singh\/Raza factors, the emails are credible and relevant. However, there is no dispute that the Respondents contacted authorities regarding the actions of their neighbours and other acts of discrimination in the Netherlands. I find that the emails do not bring anything new to the appeal and I do not accept them into evidence.\nORAL HEARING\n[23] Although neither the Appellant nor the Respondents have requested an oral hearing, as I have accepted new evidence, the Federal Court13 has held that the onus rests with me to address the discretion to hold an oral hearing. Subsection 110(6) of IRPA gives me the discretion to hold an oral hearing if new evidence has been accepted that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Respondents, that is central to the decision with respect to the Respondents' claim and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the Respondents' claim.\n[24] I find that the new evidence accepted in the appeal does not raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Respondents, is not central to the decision and does not justify allowing or rejecting the Respondents' claim. I find that I do not have the discretion to hold an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[25] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.14\nRespondents' claim with respect to Iran\n[26] The Appellant does not dispute any of the facts of the case or the determination of the RPD as they relate to Iran, the country of the Principal Respondent's birth. I agree and find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Respondents would face persecution in Iran and would not benefit from state protection there.\nRespondents' claim with respect to the Netherlands\n[27] The sole issue in the appeal is whether the RPD was correct in finding that Respondents would not benefit from state protection in the Netherlands. The Appellant argues that this finding is unreasonable based on the evidence and does not adhere to the case law jurisprudence as it related to state protection. The Respondents argue that the new evidence shows the consistent indifference of Dutch law enforcement to their requests for help over a period of more than six years and reinforces the strength of their argument.\n[28] The Appellant's argument has merit. In any claim for protection, the Courts15 have long held that state protection is presumed to be available and that refugee claimants bear the burden of proving that their country of nationality is unable or unwilling to protect them, or that they have valid reasons for not seeking that protection. The more democratic the State's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.16\n[29] The objective evidence indicates that the Netherlands is a free and democratic state and therefore the Respondents have a heavy burden.\n[30] The Respondents' claim is based on threats from the Principal Respondent's father's family (the agents of persecution) primarily due to the facts that the Principal Respondent is unmarried and gave birth to the Associate Respondent. The Respondents argue that because they could not get protection from the years of abuse inflicted by Dutch natives in her building, she knew that approaching the police regarding the agents of persecution would be futile, if not deadly.\n[31] I am not persuaded by the Respondents' argument. The Principal Respondent's own evidence17 is that when she became pregnant with the Associate Respondent, the agents of persecution began to target her specifically. She moved to a shelter, and was later given a place to stay. From this, I infer that the authorities in the Netherlands not only considered her situation to be serious, but took action. Unfortunately, this new location was passed on to the agents of persecution by persons the Principal Respondent believed to be her friends. Authorities in the Netherlands had no part in this betrayal. The threats from the agents of persecution escalated shortly after the Associate Respondent was born, and included maiming, beheading and the elimination of the Associate Respondent. At that point in time, the Respondents had not witnessed the consistent indifference of Dutch law enforcement, nor had the Associate Respondent suffered any discrimination at the hands of neighbours in the Netherlands.\n[32] I have reviewed the list of authorities18 relied upon by the Respondents in the appeal. In all of these cases where state protection was an issue, the claimants had gone to the police, in some cases multiple times, to no avail. In the case at bar, at no time did the Respondents ever approach authorities regarding the agents of persecution's threats.\n[33] The Principal Respondent's reasoning for never going to the police regarding the threats to the Associate Respondent was that the agents of persecution threatened \"that if we go to the police or authorities all of us shall be killed\"19. The documentary evidence20 is that the Iranian government uses refugees to monitor other refugees outside of the country, and mentions a case of an Iraqi man arrested for collecting information about Iranian refugees in a number of countries, including the Netherlands. However, the Respondents have not presented any evidence that the agents of persecution had contacts or informants within the police or other authorities in the Netherlands or would had any way of knowing whether the Respondents had approached authorities.\n[34] For these reasons, I find that the Respondents have not provided clear and convincing evidence of the inability of authorities in the Netherlands to protect them. I therefore find that the Respondents have not rebutted the presumption of state protection in the Netherlands.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Charles A. McDermott\"\nCharles A.

After independently reviewing the record, I find that the Refugee Protection Division's (RPD) decision is incorrect and that Ms. B is a Convention refugee.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] Ms. B is a Jewish transgender (trans) woman and citizen of the United States. She came to Canada seeking protection in 2019 because she fears that the American police and justice system will not protect her against transphobic Americans generally. Ms. B testified to incidents of transphobia and fear-mongering by American politicians and civil organizations and violence against trans women. She also testified to experiences of discrimination and transphobia in her own employment and housing and to her experiences seeking police protection on multiple occasions.\n[3] In addition to fearing transphobic persecution by society, Ms. B fears targeting by a few specific individuals. She fears that her ex-roommate, her ex-landlord, and a debt collection agency are targeting her with threats and violence. In 2015 Ms. B sought protection against her ex-roommate after he threatened her with a gun in the room. She was given temporary protection until the charges were withdrawn, and her application for a permanent protective order was declined. Ms. B moved to several different locations in Colorado but still encountered her ex-roommate at these new locations. Police did not respond to her calls reporting these encounters.\n[4] Ms. B's ex-landlord won a civil lawsuit against her. As a result, Ms. B is required to provide the court with her updated address information every time she moves. This information is accessible to Ms. B's ex-landlord. In addition, Ms. B's ex-roommate appeared at some of the civil court proceedings alongside her ex-landlord. As a result, Ms. B believes he is being fed her address information from her former landlord, enabling him to continue stalking and threatening her.\n[5] In 2021, Ms. B was contacted by an agent acting on behalf of a company to which she owes money. In an email to Ms. B, the agent threatened to take action against her.\n[6] Ms. B represented herself before the RPD. The RPD found Ms. B credible and accepted that she faces problems with her ex-roommate, ex-landlord, and a debt collector. The RPD also accepted that trans individuals in the United States face discrimination, harassment, and violence which could lead to persecution. However, the RPD found that, in Ms. B's case, her experiences did not establish persecution. The RPD rejected Ms. B's claim because it found that she had not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the United States was either unwilling or unable to protect her.\nArguments on appeal\n[7] Ms. B remains self-represented in her appeal before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). She argues the RPD failed to consider her evidence and that this resulted in a procedurally unfair process. She further argues that the RPD erred by basing its assessment of state protection on the degree of protection available to cisgendered women rather than trans women. Ms. B argues that American federal and state laws are a patchwork of inadequate protections that are unable to meaningfully protect trans women. She further argues that the social and political climate in the United States tends toward regression and rescinding of past protections afforded to trans individuals. Ms. B further points to her personal experience of attempts to obtain police protection to address stalking and argues that this is evidence of an unwillingness by the police to protect.\n[8] On March 2, 2022, I provided the Minister and Ms. B with notice1 that I would be considering the availability of internal flight alternatives (IFA) in the states of Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York. I also sought submissions on the effectiveness of protection orders, and clarification from Ms. B on her ability to obtain further protection after her application for a permanent protection order was denied. I further notified the Minister and Ms. B of my intent to rely on the current National Documentation Package (NDP) for the United States (US), dated February 3, 2022, as well as on a report by Freedom House, titled From Crisis to Reform: A Call to Strengthen America's Battered Democracy. Since this document does not appear in the NDP for the US, a hard copy and link to the document was provided.2\n[9] To date, the Minister has not provided any submissions or intervened in any way in these proceedings.\n[10] Ms. B has introduced several pieces of new evidence both prior to and following my March 2022 Directions. She has also requested an oral hearing.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[11] According to the law,3 I can only accept evidence that arose after the rejection of the claim, was not reasonably available, or could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been presented at the time of the RPD decision. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.4\n[12] When appellants submit further evidence after their appeal record has been perfected, I am required to ask additional questions before allowing the late submissions. These questions ask whether the late submissions are relevant, probative, and bring any new evidence to the appeal and whether the submissions could reasonably have been provided with the perfected record.5\n[13] In both cases, it is up to the appellant to make full and detailed submissions about how any of the proposed new evidence meets the requirements of the law and how that evidence relates to them.6\n[14] Ms. B's appeal record was perfected on September 15, 2021. Included in her appeal record and in the multiple Rule 29 applications7 that she subsequently made are news articles and reports, US and Canadian court decisions, US statutes, journal articles, and her written submissions. The Canadian court decisions8 and international human rights covenants9 will be considered, but they do not constitute new evidence and therefore are not subject to a new evidence assessment.\nEvidence that is not admitted\n[15] Ms. B provided several US court decisions and statutes in her Rule 29 applications that relate to the treatment of Black Americans or excessive use of force by police. She argues that these cases are relevant because they demonstrate the inherent injustice built into the US legal system. She further argues that she did not know that this type of evidence would be necessary at the time that the RPD made its decision. I accept that explanation, and I accept that she may not have been able to submit these documents with her perfected appeal record because she is self-represented. However, I still decline to admit these documents because I find that they are not directly relevant to the determinative issue in the appeal. Ms. B is a white woman.10 While there is, undeniably, a history of racially unjust and oppressive laws in the US justice system, that does not mean that Ms. B is targeted or affected by those laws and policies. The cases about excessive use of force by police officers are in relation to cisgender men. I recognize M.s B's argument that the police are able to mistreat and abuse trans people because of the application of \"qualified immunity.\"11 While the information in these cases may be new, and credible, I find that this evidence is neither directly relevant nor probative to the appeal. Yet another case deals with voting rights. While this deals with the state of democracy in the US, I find this information about challenges to voting rights is already generally present in the NDP and other country documents for the US. Therefore, this case brings no new or relevant information to the appeal. For these reasons, I decline to admit the following cases Brandenburg v Ohio12, Shelby County v Holder,13 Daniel Rivas-Villegas v Ramon Cortesluna,14 City of Tahlequah, and Oklahoma et al. v Austin P. Bond.15 I also decline to admit S. 3178, \"An Act to amend title 18 of the United States Code, to specify lynching as a deprivation of civil rights.\"16 I further decline to admit the news article related to Congress's failure to pass an anti-lynching law.17\n[16] I decline to admit the cases and articles relating to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party's leadership.18 These cases pre-date the RPD decision, and there is insufficient explanation as to how these documents bring relevant and probative new evidence to the issues on appeal.\n[17] Ms. B provided a copy of a court Order List dated Monday, October 18, 2021,19 and a copy of the UK libel decision in Russell v Duke Norfolk20 in a Rule 29 application. No explanation for the Order List or the libel decision was provided. I have already accepted Ms. B's explanation for being unable to produce any of her new evidence before the RPD made its decision, and I have found that, as a self-represented person, it is reasonable to expect that she would not have thought to produce all of the available evidence at the time her appeal record was perfected. However, absent any explanation from Ms. B, I do not see how the libel decision or court Order List brings any relevant or probative new evidence to the determinative issues in the appeal. I therefore decline to admit these documents.\n[18] Other cases and articles21 relate to the right to abortion and reproductive choice previously protected under Roe v Wade22 and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern PA v Casey.23 Ms. B has provided copies of these decisions and articles discussing abortion rights. I find that this issue is tangentially related to Ms. B's claim insofar as it pertains to US political and judicial views on reproductive choice and freedoms. However, with the exception of the draft decision in Dobbs and articles discussing that decision, I find the cases and articles focusing on abortion rights alone and the leak of the draft Dobbs decision24 add little relevant and probative information to the appeal. The articles and cases are not new (they pre-date the rejection of the claim), and insufficient explanation was given as to why they were not submitted at the time of perfecting the appeal. For these reasons, I decline to admit these documents as the requirements of Rule 29(4) have not been met.25\n[19] Ms. B also provided a copy of the Hartford Guidelines and several decisions of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia.26 She argues that these documents are relevant to establishing the constitutive elements of persecution. I disagree. My assessment is guided by Canadian law on the topic, and while international law is informative, I do not find it determinative in this case. The definition of persecution for the purposes of international criminal law is different from the definition applied in refugee law. I am assessing Ms. B's claim under Canadian refugee law. I therefore find that these documents do not bring relevant or probative evidence to the appeal. They are also not new (they pre-date the rejection of the claim), and insufficient explanation was given as to why they were not submitted at the time of perfecting the appeal. For these reasons, I decline to admit these documents as the requirements of Rule 29(4) have not been met.\n[20] Finally, Ms. B provided late submissions and evidence packages on August 28, 2022, and October 10, 2022. I decline to admit any of the August 28, 2022, documents. Although these documents (primarily news articles) relate to recent events in the US, they are essentially more of the same evidence on the hostility toward trans individuals in the media and in some US states. I find the evidence already in the record adequately speaks to these issues and, therefore, that this evidence is not new because it does not bring new information. Similarly, the information about the site \"Kiwi Farms\" was already presented to the RPD, and the recent articles about the site's targeting of a Canadian trans woman does not bring relevant or probative information regarding Ms. B's claim or personal experience. As a result, I decline to admit these documents as they add little relevant, new, and probative information to the appeal.\n[21] The October 10, 2022, documents are much like those in the August 28, 2022, package. Some of the documents are undated or pre-date the RPD decision.27 Insufficient explanation was given as to why they were not submitted at the time of perfecting the appeal. These documents are publicly available and were accessible to Ms. B. I find that they could have been provided with the appeal record. I therefore decline to admit these documents. Other documents are court decisions,28 news articles,29 and a public relations statement30 regarding the treatment of trans children and conditions in states other than Colorado and the proposed IFA location. They do not bring new information to the appeal that is not already present in the RPD record, the Appellant's Record, or in previous Rule 29 applications. Though new, in that they post-date the RPD decision, I find that these documents31 do not bring relevant or probative information to the appeal. With the exception of six articles which I discuss below, I decline to admit the documents in the October 10, 2022, package.\nThe remainder of Ms. B's evidence is admitted\n[22] The remainder of Ms. B's new evidence includes news articles,32 reports,33 journal articles,34 social media posts,35 and US legislation,36 legal\/political documents,37 and caselaw38. Although some of these documents pre-date39 the RPD decision, they are all admitted into evidence. I am mindful that Ms. B was self-represented at the RPD. While she is fairly sophisticated, her submissions reflect an unclear understanding of the legal tests and statutes that are applicable to the assessment of her claim. Therefore, I accept that she may not have known to produce relevant legislation, caselaw, and journal articles at the time the RPD decision was made. The documents that post-date the RPD decision could not have been provided before the decision was rendered. In terms of Ms. B's ability to have produced these documents with her perfected appeal record, I note that many of them post-date the perfection date, and I find Ms. B's failure to produce the documents that pre-date the appeal record's perfection is again explained by her status as a self-represented appellant before the RAD. I find that Ms. B would not have known the degree of proof she was required to muster in order to establish her case at the time of perfection and that this justifies the multiple voluminous submissions (nearly 8000 pages) of late evidence.\n[23] The documents provided with the appeal record must be new, credible and relevant to the appeal. The Rule 29 evidence must be probative as well. With the exception of the documents that I have declined to admit in paragraphs 15 to 20 of these reasons, I find that all of the documents in Ms. B's perfected Appellant's Record bring new, credible and relevant information to the issues in the appeal, particularly since the NDP for the US is very light, containing little information on the treatment of transgender individuals in the US. Similarly, I find that the Rule 29 documents that I have not already declined to admit, bring new, credible, relevant, and probative evidence to the appeal. The remaining Appellant's Record and Rule 29 documents include legislation, journal articles, human rights reports, and caselaw that speak to the way that politicians describe trans people and the way that their rights to equality and access to employment and public spaces are interpreted by the courts, law enforcement, and public policy groups. Other articles speak to the issue of internal flight alternatives, providing general information about the cost of living and housing in different cities or providing more specific information about the conditions in which trans individuals live in various cities and states across the US.40 I therefore find that the tests for the admissibility of new and late evidence have been met, and I allow these documents into evidence.\n[24] Ms. B provided twenty-one sets of her own written arguments41 with her Rule 29 applications between October 2021 and October 2022. These written submissions provide updates on the situation in the United States and explain the significance of recent landmark court decisions, as well as the articles and reports that she provided. Some of these submissions were provided in response to my Directions. I have already explained why I accept Ms. B's explanations for her late submission of evidence and written arguments. I find her submissions credible because they are prepared by her and, as such, presumed to be truthful. I further find the submissions relevant because they relate to new events and issues that Ms. B could not have been aware were relevant at the time she perfected her appeal record. In many cases, the submissions relate to contemporary events and incidents relating to the treatment of trans people in the US. Although there is some repetition to the submissions, I find that, overall, they satisfy the legal criteria of bringing new information to the appeal. Finally, I find the submissions probative because they address the determinative issues in the appeal. Consequently, the written submissions are all allowed into the record.\nAn oral hearing will not be held\n[25] I am not convening an oral hearing. The RAD may choose to hold an oral hearing only if there is new evidence that raises a serious issue about the Appellants' credibility, is central to the decision, and which, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim. I find that the new evidence does not raise a credibility issue for Ms. B. Therefore, it is not necessary to test the new evidence at an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[26] I have applied the standard of correctness while reviewing the RPD decision and have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence before me. This appeal was a difficult one. The issues are complex, and extra care is required because of Ms. B's status as an unrepresented appellant. Nevertheless, she has done an impressive job in corralling evidence to support her claim and in identifying errors in the RPD's decision. The evidence she produced for the RPD and RAD includes numerous country conditions documents, personal corroborating evidence of her attempts to gain state protection in America, police bodycam footage, statutes, legislative records, American and Canadian caselaw, and written submissions arguing the merits of her claim. I have reviewed all of these, and I have considered the Chairperson's SOGIESC Guidelines and the Gender Guidelines.42\n[27] I find that the RPD erred by failing to consider critical evidence on the events that took place after Ms. B's protection order was cancelled. Specifically, I find that the RPD failed to consider that Ms. B was denied police protection or investigation when she reported continued stalking by her ex-roommate near her residence seven separate times. The RPD also failed to consider how Colorado's open carry gun laws combined with the general climate of anti-trans hatred growing in the US could make Ms. B perpetually vulnerable and at risk to her life.\n[28] I further find that Ms. B does not have an IFA in the US because relocation for a person with her profile, in her circumstances, would be unreasonable. My reasons are as follows.\nTrans individuals face discrimination and significant risks to their lives in the US\n[29] It is clear from the country conditions evidence that trans individuals face considerable threats of physical, psychological, and social harm. \"Transgender people experience particularly high rates of discrimination in public places.\"43 Trans women of colour are especially targeted for violent hate crimes and killings.44 According to the Williams Institute, transgender people are \"over four times more likely than cisgender people to experience violent victimization, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple assault.\"45 The evidence shows that 2021 was the deadliest year for trans people in the US since 2013 and that 96 percent of those murdered in 2021 were trans women or trans feminine people.46 The extent of the violence that trans people face is also virtually unknown to the public. One report indicates that, despite 2021 being the deadliest year on record for trans people, transphobic violence received less than 45 minutes of collective reporting time by TV news stations during that year.47\n[30] Moreover, \"about half of all violent victimizations were not reported to police.\"48 This is consistent with the SOGIESC Guidelines, which note that \"under-reporting may be more pronounced for individuals who face marginalization.\"49 Country documents show that legal services and courts are among the essential services where trans people have reported experiences of discrimination.50 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights wrote the following in its 2021 report on human rights in the US:\n\"... the IACHR is concerned that actions were taken that limit the training of public employees in the protection of rights. In this regard, the IACHR notes that on September 4, the director of the Office of Budget Management sent an instruction to the heads of the various government agencies to end training related to equality and non-discrimination. Subsequently, on October 8, the Department of Justice suspended all training for its personnel on diversity and inclusion.\"51\nWhen crimes are reported, it is, therefore, doubtful whether the justice system workers that a victim encounters have had adequate anti-discrimination training and awareness to handle their complaints without bias.\n[31] Hateful rhetoric against the trans community has also flourished in recent years. There are many open calls for direct action against trans and gender-nonconforming individuals and their allies, which have resulted in street gangs disrupting Pride events and the engagement of far-right aligned individuals in \"targeted harassment, intimidation, and threats against trans people, drag shows, and other LGBTQ events with increased frequency in recent years. ... there have already been 33 incidents in 2022, putting it on track to be even worse than last year.\"52\n[32] Public accommodations laws, which protect the rights of trans people to access services and spaces open to the public do not exist throughout the US.53 While nearly half of US states have some protections in place, the degree of protection offered varies considerably.54 Progressive steps to expand anti-discrimination protections for trans individuals have been considerably hampered in recent years by movements for religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, attempts to repeal anti-discrimination laws, bathroom bans prohibiting trans people from using bathrooms that accord with their gender identity, and the passage of state laws prohibiting the passage or enforcement of local, municipal or county non-discrimination laws.55 As Ms. B's evidence shows, in the first three months of 2022 alone nearly 240 anti-LGBTQ bills were filed, most of them targeting trans people.56 This marks a considerable rise from the 41 bills that were filed just four years earlier in 2018.57 In addition, the Southern Poverty Law Center has warned that \"anti-LGBTQ appointments to the judiciary will likely threaten trans and queer Americans' civil rights for a generation.\"58\n[33] Despite this, on the whole, Americans, including transgender Americans, are able to run for and hold public office, freely assemble, and advocate for their political causes.59 Though the rights of trans individuals are under political and cultural assault, the evidence shows that there is also pushback. The report on public accommodations laws indicates that nationally, there is broad public support for inclusive anti-discrimination laws, and that only about one-quarter of Americans (though still a sizable number) oppose equal rights for trans people.60\n[34] The evidence, therefore, shows three things. Firstly, that the trans community is at heightened risk of experiencing violence, harassment, and discrimination that could, in certain circumstances, be considered persecutory. Secondly, that across most of the US, trans people are excluded from protections that would enforce their right to equal treatment in public settings and in accessing services available to the public. This exclusion from protection makes the trans community vulnerable to further assaults on their rights. Thirdly, the evidence shows that the trans community is already facing active and increasing efforts to deny and restrict their rights to live freely, openly, and as equals in public spaces, even though there is broad public support for equal treatment of trans individuals.\nCredibility and facts established through the evidence\n[35] The RPD found Ms. B credible in her testimony about her experiences in America. I agree with this finding. Through her testimony and her supporting documentary evidence, Ms. B has established the following facts on the standard of a balance of probabilities:\n(a) She was rejected by her family because of her gender non-conformity and subjected to various forms of abuse. Her parents forced intake of XXXX drugs and put her through the torture of conversion therapy and boot camp to correct her perceived deviance.\n(b) She experienced discrimination in employment prior to her corrective surgery and afterward;\n(c) She relocated to Colorado because of its laws and reputation as a safe state for trans people;\n(d) She has had her deadname61 published on an international anti-trans website;\n(e) Her former roommate placed a gun in the room, facing toward her while threatening her and making transphobic statements. The police responded to her request for protection and arrested her roommate. The District Attorney (DA) charged Ms. B's ex-roommate with felony menacing, and a mandatory protection order was issued. The DA later dropped the charges in the interests of justice and because they would not be able to establish all the elements of the offence. When this happened, Ms. B sought and was denied her application in civil court for a permanent protection order.\n(f) Following the dropped charges, Ms. B's former roommate began stalking her, showing up outside of her home on seven occasions, even after she relocated twice. Ms. B called the police but did not receive protection against the continued stalking.62\n(g) Ms. B's former landlord initiated a civil proceeding against her for unpaid rent and damages. The landlord was awarded the judgment, and Ms. B was ordered to pay nearly $XXXX. During the court proceedings, Ms. B's former landlord was accompanied by the roommate that had threatened and stalked Ms. B. The former landlord also applied to the court to have Ms. B's deadname utilized in the proceedings. Because of the judgment, Ms. B must disclose her address to her former landlord.\n(h) A debt collection agency has threatened to take legal action against Ms. B to recoup monies that they claim they are owed.\n[36] The evidence does not, in my view, establish that the debt collection agency or Ms. B's former landlord were acting in a persecutory way by threatening to take her to court or by actually doing so in order to reclaim money that they are owed.\n[37] I am aware of Ms. B's claim that her former landlord is a trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) and her argument that these political views motivated her former landlord to incite her former roommate to stalk her. I must make findings of fact on the standard of a balance of probabilities. I find the evidence that Ms. B has submitted is insufficient to impute a persecutory intent to her former landlord. I accept the possibility Ms. B's former landlord may hold anti-trans political views based on her insistence that Ms. B's deadname be used in court. However, it does not automatically follow that she actively wants to see Ms. B physically harmed or that she is making efforts to ensure that harm is directly inflicted. The evidence is simply too tenuous to establish that allegation as fact.\n[38] My findings lead me to conclude that Ms. B has experienced persecution in the past at the hands of her parents and that she has experienced considerable amounts of discrimination in her employment and relationships with housemates. On a forward-looking basis, I find that Ms. B faces a serious possibility of persecution by her former roommate based on her evidence of his threats against her, his stalking of her while openly carrying a gun, the police's refusal to act on her complaints of stalking, and the combination of general anti-trans violence and lax gun laws which elevate the risks that Ms. B faces of fatal violence by her former roommate. My reasons, therefore, focus on Ms. B's access to state protection against the threats and stalking by her former roommate and her ability to relocate elsewhere in the US to be protected against him.\nAdequate state protection is not available to trans individuals in most US states\n[39] It is generally accepted that the police are the primary source of state protection, and that states are not required to provide perfect protection in all instances.63\n[40] The evidence shows that trans individuals were able to go to the police to report incidents of violence and to seek protection. Some of the articles show that the police responded to these reports by arresting the trans victim rather than their assailants.64 Other evidence states that when a trans woman is a victim, police often assume that the trans woman instigated the violence or that the police dismiss or downplay the violence.65 A report on policing policies related to trans people shows that the vast majority of police departments in the US lack training and comprehensive policies on interactions with trans individuals.66 Other documents show that trans people are at higher risk of police violence,67 and \"law enforcement officials themselves are frequently perpetrators of anti-transgender violence.\"68 The Transgender Surveys indicate that across the country and regardless of state, very high percentages of trans individuals experience further abuse, victimization and abuse when they encounter police or go to them for help.69 These reports also reflect very high rates of unwillingness by trans individuals to approach the police for protection.70\n[41] However, that does not mean that every trans person in the US is reluctant to seek police help or that every trans person has experienced police abuse, harassment, or revictimization as a result.71 The evidence indicates that Ms. B was not afraid of approaching the police and that she was not abused or harassed by the police when she sought their help. But those facts alone do not establish that the protection Ms. B received was adequate. In assessing whether the protection Ms. B actually received was adequate, I am not assessing what is available to the general public; I am assessing the protection that was made available to her in the broader context of the risks she faces as a trans woman.\nUltimately, Ms. B did not receive adequate state protection\n[42] Ms. B has testified that she was discriminated against when she tried to access legal protection. She argues that the police informed her ex-roommate that his case would likely not go to trial and that neither the courts nor the police were interested in offering meaningful protection. In support, Ms. B provided police body camera footage, letters between her and the District Attorney (DA) addressing the DA's reasons for dropping the criminal charges, and the court reports related to her unsuccessful application for protection orders.\n[43] The RPD considered her evidence and found that the evidence demonstrated that Ms. B had, in fact, benefitted from state protection because the police responded to her call and arrested her ex-roommate; because the DA pursued the charges before deciding to drop them; and because the court had granted a mandatory protection order. The RPD also noted that the District of Columbia and nineteen states (including Colorado, where Ms. B lived) have enacted anti-discrimination laws to protect their LGBTQ+ residents.72 The RPD concluded that this meant that Ms. B had access to adequate protection going forward.\n[44] For the reasons that follow, I agree with the RPD's findings that Ms. B was not denied state protection when she first complained to the authorities about the threats from her husband, but I find that the RPD erred by failing to consider how Ms. B's subsequent complaints were handled by the police.\nProcedural fairness and the police response to threat by roommate in XXXX 2019\n[45] I have considered Ms. B's argument that the RPD breached her procedural fairness rights by willfully ignoring the video footage obtained from the body cams worn by police during the incident with her former roommate. In reviewing the RPD's reasons, I find that the RPD did consider this evidence but did not interpret its contents in the same way as Ms. B. Having viewed the footage and read the transcribed sections of the footage that Ms. B highlighted in her submissions to the RPD, I find the RPD's interpretation of the police interaction is correct. I find that the police officers were fair and respectful in their treatment of Ms. B. I do not see the police officer as having coached Ms. B's roommate on how to describe the incident. Nor do I find that the officer was dismissive of the facts. The officer's statements appear to be an attempt to explain to a scared man the legal process and charges that he would face. The officer was acknowledging that a gun was left pointed in Ms. B's direction intentionally by her roommate but also acknowledging the distinction that the gun was not in Ms. B's roommate's hands at that time and that this would lead to a lesser-used charge that did not often result in full criminal proceedings by the DA. In referring to a change in Ms. B's version of events, I understand the officer to be referring to her initial statement that the gun was in her roommate's hands when the threat was issued and the later clarification that it was not, as well as the difference between Ms. B's initial statement that her roommate made a gesture toward the gun and her later statement that he expressly referred to it but did not gesture.\n[46] I appreciate that Ms. B would have preferred for the police officer to have interacted differently with her roommate and to have accepted that the presence of the gun constituted a threat against her life. I also acknowledge the evidence stating that police often assume that trans women instigate the violence against them or that police dismiss or downplay the violence that trans women experience.73 But Ms. B's personal evidence does not demonstrate, in my view, any maliciousness on the part of the officers she encountered. In addition, the fact that multiple officers were present nearby but did not all appear inside the house does not reflect an unwillingness to enforce the law. Rather it reflects a measured response by the police, and the video indicates that they were concerned with making sure that they did not escalate a situation where they were aware that a weapon was present. All of this suggests to me that the officers were acting appropriately. As a result, I reject Ms. B's arguments that the RPD acted in bad faith or procedurally unfairly by ignoring her evidence. I also reject her argument that the evidence shows that the police in Colorado acted in bad faith when they responded to her call for help in XXXX 2019.\nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that the DA and the court were biased\n[47] Ms. B has argued that she was denied justice because her ex-roommate was not convicted even though there was enough evidence for conviction under the charge of felony menacing. She provided copies of the relevant statutes.74 On the surface, it would appear that Ms. B's argument has merit. But neither she, nor I, are experts in US law, and the statute alone does not tell me about the standard on which the charges need to be proved. Nor do I have the totality of the evidence that the DA and court would have had before them.\n[48] The evidence from Ms. B shows that the DA initially proceeded with the charges but, within two months, decided to drop them \"in the interests of justice.\"75 I am mindful of the evidence I cited earlier about the lack of continued anti-discrimination training for Justice Department employees and that it leaves open the possibility that some discrimination or bias had a hand in the DA's decision not to pursue the charges. But there are many factors that go into decisions to prosecute, not all of which are rooted in bias. There is no way, on the evidence before me, to know what \"in the interests of justice\" means, but the motion to dismiss the charges gives some indication. It states that the charges were withdrawn because \"the People do not believe that they have a reasonable likelihood of success at trial.\"76 Admittedly, this is vague because it does not explain why the likelihood of success is considered low, but it points to reasons other than bias for the dropped charges.\n[49] Similarly, the court minutes regarding Ms. B's application for a personal protection order after the charges were dismissed state that she \"has not proven her case\" and \"has not met the criteria for a finding of a PPO.\"77 While the court's and the DA's explanations are vague, I find I would be relying excessively on speculation and supposition to reach the same conclusion as Ms. B with the evidence that I have before me. For these reasons, I find that the DA and the court did not act unfairly on in a biased way toward her by dropping the charges against her former roommate.\nMs. B was denied adequate protection after the charges against her ex-roommate were dropped\n[50] I find the RPD erred by failing to consider whether Ms. B continued to receive adequate protection after the charges against her ex-roommate were dropped. As the court noted in Moran Gudiel,78 for the state protection test to be correctly applied, one must consider the particular situation of the claimant and look at whether the state protection that was offered actually worked and yielded concrete results.79\n[51] Ms. B consistently stated that, after the charges were dropped and a further protection order denied, her ex-roommate stood outside her home on several separate occasions while holding his shotgun.80 She also gave credible and consistent evidence regarding the anti-trans slurs that he used against her.81 She indicated that his presence was particularly noteworthy because she had moved residences at least twice out of fear. She further indicated that she called the police each of these seven times, including once going to the police station to report the stalking behaviour. Each time she was told that her ex-roommate had the right to open-carry a firearm and that there was nothing the police could do to protect her.\n[52] There is nothing inherently improper about the police response to Ms. B's reports. Colorado is an open-carry state. Her ex-roommate could not, therefore, be found in violation of any laws simply because he was carrying a weapon. And because there were no protection orders requiring that he keep his distance from Ms. B, he could not be found in breach of any conditions or legal requirements. Ms. B has not indicated that he said anything to her when she saw him. Consequently, I understand why the police would have been unable to treat his lawful presence and possession of a weapon as a threat. It may be hard for authorities to prove that a stalker has no right to be where they are or that their intent is to threaten and harass.\n[53] That said, it is possible that victims are aware that they are being stalked but are unable to obtain any kind of protection for these kinds of reasons. Consequently, women in these situations are left highly vulnerable and in a state of near-perpetual insecurity.\n[54] In this respect, I find the RPD's assessment of Ms. B's risk to be lacking. It is not sufficient to say simply that there was no crime for the authorities to act on. It is significant, in my view, that the ex-roommate appeared in Ms. B's vicinity on seven occasions, each time with his gun. I note that in the body camera footage, Ms. B testified that until the day that she filed the first police complaint, she had never seen the gun,82 and her ex-roommate's partner indicated that they usually kept the gun inside their bedroom because it was intended only to respond to home invaders.83 The presence of the gun in public and in close proximity to the various locations where Ms. B had moved to after the protection order was dropped is highly noteworthy. As a result, I give Ms. B's interpretation of her ex-roommate's presence considerable weight. I find that by repeatedly appearing near Ms. B's various residences in the months leading up to her flight to Canada, her ex-roommate was attempting to terrorize her. The country conditions evidence shows that in just about half of all instances where trans individuals were murdered, they were killed by someone they knew.84 In 32 percent of fatal incidents of anti-trans violence, the killer was unknown to the victim.85\n[55] I have already discussed the evidence establishing that trans individuals live in a general climate of insecurity about their physical and psychological safety. It cannot be doubted that the ability of individuals to freely and openly carry guns only heightens the risk and fear of fatal assault faced by trans individuals, who already face elevated risks of both random and targeted violence.\n[56] Amnesty International describes gun violence in the US as a human rights crisis.86 It further states that \"[i]n the face of clear evidence of persistent firearm violence, high rates of gun ownership, and ease of access to firearms by individuals likely to misuse them, the USA is failing to meet its obligation to protect and promote human rights pursuant to international law.\"87\n[57] The evidence indicates that rates of gun homicides have increased in recent years.88 Every single state and district in the US allows for some form of concealed carrying of a firearm in public.89 It must also be noted that in 65 percent of all fatal anti-trans violence occurring between 2013 and 2019, guns were involved.90\n[58] Considered in this context of violent anti-trans public and political discourse, general harassment and violence towards trans people, the prevalence of firearms, and the right to openly carry firearms in public, I find Ms. B's fear of her ex-roommate and of general anti-trans violence is logical and supported by the evidence.\n[59] I am also aware that there are some similarities between this case and the facts in Miller,91 a case that was recently decided by the Federal Court. In Miller, the court found that the RAD erred by finding that US state protection was inadequate in protecting a woman fleeing her abusive white nationalist husband. The court held that the RAD erred by demanding perfect rather than adequate protection.\n[60] Although the Federal Court found that US state protection was adequate in Miller, that finding of fact is not binding on me. I am entitled, and obligated, to make my own independent findings of fact based on the evidence before me. Each case must be assessed on its own merits. And facts, including the fact of the availability of adequate state protection, must be determined on the standard of a balance of probabilities.\n[61] The similarities between Ms. B's case and the facts in Miller are that they are both American, both sought and received to some extent a protective response from state authorities, and both ultimately fled to Canada because, despite the state's efforts to provide protection, the threats and fear of violence and death continued. But the similarities end there.\n[62] Firstly, unlike in Miller, Ms. B was not offered additional protection when she continued to report that her ex-roommate kept appearing near her home while holding a shotgun. The police responded to subsequent reports of stalking in Miller, but they did not do so in Ms. B's case. Her reports were not investigated, and incident reports not made.92 Secondly, because the Miller decision related to a cisgender white woman, the RAD's decision, in that case, did not address the gaps that appear in the system of protection available to trans women or the way that gun violence, ownership, and open-carry laws exacerbate the vulnerability of trans women. As a result, I find the decision in Miller is not determinative of the question of state protection in Ms. B's case.\n[63] The SOGIESC Guidelines state that, in the state protection analysis, focus must be on \"the personal circumstances of the claimant, in conjunction with a fact-based analysis of the operational adequacy and effectiveness of state protection in the country of reference.\"93 The Guidelines further stress the importance of considering that SOGIESC individuals may face differential protection or uneven access to state protection based on additional factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, faith or belief system, age, disability, health status, social class and education.\"94\n[64] Ms. B is a trans woman who has lived in several US states and experienced discrimination or persecution in each beginning in her youth.95 She most recently sought safety in one of the seven US states that offer full-ranging public accommodations laws.96 Despite this, she has encountered discrimination that led to her relocation to different cities within Colorado.97 She remained in Colorado for over a decade until she was met with police refusal to investigate her reports of continued stalking by a man whom the authorities knew possessed a gun and had uttered transphobic slurs against her. Again, I note that Colorado is an open carry state and, therefore, that Ms. B would not have recourse to any protection unless and until her ex-roommate escalated his behaviour. For this reason, the refusal by police to investigate Ms. B's repeated reports of stalking by her ex-roommate lead me to find that she was denied adequate protection.\n[65] There is little to no evidence before me about the policies that are actually in force at police stations in Colorado. I have no evidence to indicate whether local police have received training or any kind of advice on interacting with trans individuals and understanding the unique threats that the trans community faces. The evidence I do have indicates that, on a balance of probabilities, there are only weak policies, if any exist at all, and that training was likely never offered at all.98 The anecdotal evidence of trans individuals' encounters with police also suggests that police sometimes lose interest in responding to similar complaints by the same person.99 Considered alongside previously cited evidence of police tendencies to minimize the threats and harms faced by trans victims, as well as Ms. B's own experience of police dismissing her complaints about stalking, I find that Ms. B is more likely than not to be denied further protection in Colorado if she again reports threats from her ex-roommate. As a result, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection would not be forthcoming for Ms. B in Colorado. I further accept Ms. B's evidence that her repeated experience of having her complaints dismissed without investigation or action have caused her to be reluctant to approach the police for help in the future.\nInternal flight alternatives are not viable\n[66] The test100 to determine whether refugee claimants should be required to seek safety elsewhere in their country of origin is two-pronged. The first prong asks whether there are any parts of the country where the refugee claimant may live without facing a serious possibility of persecution. That assessment involves considering how motivated the agents of persecution are in finding the claimant and their capacity to reach them. If a safe location can be identified, then the decision-maker must consider the second prong of the test, which asks whether it would be reasonable under the circumstances to ask a person to relocate to that place.\n[67] In identifying potential IFA locations, I was mindful that the willingness of the state to enact preventative laws--those that prohibit the discrimination that builds to, encourages, and normalizes violence--is important in ensuring the right of trans people to a free and dignified life.\n[68] The SOGIESC Guidelines highlight that \"decriminalization of same-sex relations or sexual or gender non-conforming behaviours, or the introduction of a new law, program or other government action designed to improve the situation of SOGIESC individuals in a country, need to be carefully assessed to determine whether state protection is adequate at the operational level. In these cases, members need to examine the degree of actual implementation, the effectiveness, and the durability of these legislative or other improvements in light of how state actors and general society continue to treat SOGIESC individuals.\"101\n[69] To this end, I have considered the network of public accommodations laws in the US. Public accommodations relate to access to public spaces such as places of business, worship, transit, medical care, restaurants, etc. These laws are important because they are meant to enforce the rights of marginalized groups to access public spaces and services and because they allow equity-seeking groups to seek redress when discriminated against or denied access to services and spaces because of their identity.\n[70] The LGBT Policy Spotlight report indicates that the majority of states do not offer broad protection against discrimination in public accommodations. The report breaks down the protections available in each of the states where anti-discrimination laws have been enacted and assesses whether the laws prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, whether the law explicitly includes restaurants, hotels and similar businesses, and whether the law explicitly includes schools, public transportation and hospitals.102 Only seven states (Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York) provide protection on all of those grounds.103 The remainder of the US-the vast majority-endorses by omission some form of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. I find that, for trans individuals, this means that there are only seven US states where their rights are theoretically fully protected and where they have the greatest chance of living a free and dignified life.\n[71] I have also considered the possibility that President Biden's Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation (\"Executive Order\")104 might positively impact the access that trans women have to protection generally. The Executive Order is currently being challenged, but not by the seven states that I have found to have comprehensive public accommodations protections. That said, I have no information on which to assess its efficacy in creating tangible change for trans individuals in these locations.\n[72] The RPD suggested IFAs of Los Angeles and San Francisco in California, the city of New York in New York state, and the cities of Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. Based on my review of the evidence, I find that the states of Oregon, Washington and California do not have comprehensive accommodations laws that would protect Ms. B's right to equal treatment and access to public spaces and services.105 As a result, I am not considering those states in my IFA analysis.\n[73] As I noted earlier in my reasons, only seven states offer comprehensive accommodations laws. Colorado was one of them. Ms. B resided there, and I have found that it is not likely to offer adequate state protection to her in the future. In my Directions to Ms. B and the Minister, I considered whether any of the remaining six states: Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, Illinois, Nevada, and New York, could be suitable IFAs.\n[74] I have found that the state of Delaware is not a suitable IFA location because of the lack of information about the treatment of transgender individuals living there. I also determined that Maine, New Jersey, Illinois and Nevada are not suitable IFA locations because of the high rates of discrimination and violence experienced by transgender individuals there.106\n[75] For the purposes of these reasons, my assessment focuses on an IFA in New York City since it was canvassed in some detail by the RPD.\nFirst prong - There is no serious possibility of persecution in New York\n[76] I have considered whether Ms. B's former roommate has the motivation and the means to pursue Ms. B to New York City in order to harm her there. I find the evidence does not show that he has either.\n[77] Ms. B speculated that her ex-roommate was able to obtain her up-to-date address information from her former landlord to whom Ms. B was required to provide that information because of the court order in the civil judgment against her. Although Ms. B agreed that she was speculating that her former landlord was sending her ex-roommate to harass her, I find it less speculative that Ms. B's ex-roommate was getting her address information because of the court's requirement for disclosure. As a result, I find that Ms. B's ex-roommate has access to her address information if she does disclose it to the courts. I agree with the RPD's finding that it was too speculative to find that Ms. B's former landlord was using the ex-roommate as a debt collector. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that Ms. B's ex-roommate was accessing her address information through the former landlord but for his own purposes. However, I find the evidence is insufficient to establish that Ms. B's ex-roommate has the financial means or the motivation to locate her in New York all these years later. Although there is evidence that he pursued her to various addresses within the state of Colorado,107 I find the evidence insufficient to establish that he is motivated to look for her if she moved outside of the state. I note that there is no evidence of any attempts to contact Ms. B or anyone she knows in either the US or Canada. I find Ms. B does not face a serious possibility of persecution by her ex-roommate in New York City.\nSecond prong - relocation is unreasonable\n[78] In order for an IFA to be reasonable, it must be a place where the appellant will not encounter great physical danger or undue hardship in travelling to or living there.108 The appellant cannot be sent to live under conditions that would jeopardize their life or safety. Although the Federal Court has established a high threshold109 to demonstrate the unreasonableness of an IFA, it has also acknowledged that mental health,110 personal characteristics such as gender and age,111 and the availability of family support112 can impact the life and security of an individual.\n[79] The SOGIESC Guidelines warn that reliable and up-to-date country conditions information, particularly for trans individuals, can be scarce, incomplete, or general in nature.113 The Guidelines further advise that the lack of information may be caused by fears of reporting and marginalization.114 I find this relevant to the state of the country conditions information available regarding trans individuals in the US. Most of the country documents focus on efforts to curtail the rights of trans people in the US. Fewer documents examine the living conditions of trans individuals, and, as I have noted, little broadcast time is given to reporting on the violence that trans individuals experience. As a result, my assessment relies heavily on the results of the 2015 Transgender Surveys and NDP Items 6.1 and 6.2. Although the Transgender Survey is dated 2015, it remains one of the most current sources of information on the daily living conditions of trans individuals since no other similar surveys appear to exist.\n[80] I have considered whether Ms. B faces a degree of discrimination in the IFA locations that would make relocation unreasonable under all of the circumstances. The evidence before me is that transphobia is a nationwide problem and that New York City is no exception.\n[81] The Transgender Survey results show that there is a high rate of employment and housing discrimination in New York. In New York, the poverty rate among trans individuals was 37 percent,115 with 26 percent of respondents reporting that they had lost their jobs, been denied work, or been denied promotions because of their gender identity or expression.116 In New York, 21 percent of respondents experienced housing discrimination.117 Despite the existence of public accommodations laws, in the year prior to the survey, 35 percent of respondents had experienced some type of mistreatment-denial of equal treatment or service, verbal harassment, physical attack-at a place of public accommodation when the staff or employees of that place knew the person was transgender.118 More than half of respondents (58 percent) indicated that they avoided using public bathrooms because of the fear of confrontation.119 More than one third of respondents (32 percent) experienced some form of discriminatory treatment by a healthcare provider.120 On the subject of police protection, 61 percent of trans respondents to the survey in New York indicated that they experienced harassment and mistreatment by police, and 58 percent stated that would be uncomfortable seeking help from the police.121\n[82] The evidence on discrimination is troubling and demonstrates that trans individuals are likely to encounter various forms of discrimination. However, I see no evidence that the government in New York is creating an atmosphere of intolerance. I note again that trans individuals are able to advocate for their rights and to freely express themselves. While discrimination exists, it appears to be largely informal. Considered as a whole, I find that the evidence does not establish that Ms. B would experience a serious possibility of discrimination rising cumulatively to the level of persecution in New York City. Nor do I find that she faces a serious possibility of persecution by the general public there.\n[83] The rates of discrimination in New York, though not rising to the level of persecution, nevertheless inform my finding that relocation would be unreasonable for Ms. B. I note the evidence that poverty is a \"strong risk factor for violence in the United States\"122 and that poverty is widespread within transgender communities.123 One in five New Yorkers live in poverty, and one-quarter of all New Yorkers pay more than half of their income in rent.124 This situation has been aggravated by Covid-19.125 Notably, although only 18 percent of the Transgender Survey respondents were unemployed in New York, 37 percent were living in poverty.\n[84] Poverty rates are important to consider because poverty exacerbates other risk factors like access to safe, stable and adequate housing.126 Homelessness for transgender people increased by 88 percent between 2016 and 2019, an increase that is markedly higher than the 11.5 percent increase in homelessness for Americans generally.127 This increase also reflects a period not considered in the Transgender surveys, which were conducted in 2015. I therefore have good reason to infer that the rate of homelessness in the trans community is very high now.\n[85] Ms. B's immigration forms indicate that she has attended a number of different colleges and universities, but she has not completed any degrees.128 Her narrative states that her primary and secondary school education was hampered by bullying and beatings because of her SOGIESC identity,129 and that her post-secondary education was frequently interrupted due to housing and income problems.130\n[86] I note that Ms. B is not wealthy. Although she is well-educated, this has not, historically, translated into reliable and well-paying jobs for her. Her evidence is that she has lost her employment multiple times because of discriminatory practices by her employers. She appears to have almost always lived with roommates, which indicates to me that her income has not been enough to support her independent access to housing. The fact that Ms. B has been subjected to debt collection, lawsuits by former landlords, and her filing for bankruptcy in 2017131 are further evidence of her lack of access to a stable and\/or adequate income. In addition, Ms. B has indicated that, between 2012 and 2013, she was extorted by a roommate and forced to live in homeless shelters in order to avoid the abuse by that roommate and her family members.132 In 2018, after losing her employment, Ms. B lost her apartment as well and had to seek refuge in the homes of others until she was able to get another job that unfortunately only lasted two weeks.133 Her subsequent employment was for similarly short durations.134 I therefore find that Ms. B already has a history of experiencing vulnerability, unstable employment leading to poverty, and homelessness as a result of her trans identity and that this supports a finding that she is at risk of experiencing the same in New York, where she currently does not appear to have any social network supports.\n[87] All of these factors lead me to conclude that Ms. B would be vulnerable in New York City, where the cost of living is terribly high. Even in cheaper neighbourhoods like the Bronx, the risk of violence is high,135 which, given the fact that trans women are more likely to experience violence than cisgender individuals, means that the risks of violence are also much greater.136 Based on the results of the Transgender Survey, I find that reporting these incidents to the police may expose Ms. B to further harassment and discrimination.\n[88] The evidence on discrimination in access to healthcare indicates that Ms. B is likely to encounter some mistreatment while attempting to access healthcare.137 This is concerning because the evidence shows that more than one-quarter of all of the New York respondents to the Transgender Survey indicated that they had not seen a doctor because of fear of being mistreated.138 In fact, 32 percent reported having at least one negative experience related to being transgender in the previous year, including experiences of being refused treatment, getting verbally harassed, being physically or sexually assaulted, or having to teach the provider about transgender people in order to get appropriate care.139 Many survey respondents (28 percent) indicated that they did not seek medical attention because the cost was prohibitive.140 I find echoes of this in Ms. B's narrative since she travelled to Thailand in order to access sex reassignment surgery that she could afford.141\n[89] I am aware that not all medical care in the US has to be paid for privately. Insurance is available through employers and through the government. The evidence indicates that 88 percent of LGBTQ Americans have either private insurance or coverage through government exchange or Medicaid,142 but this number does not mean that the majority of trans individuals in the US have health insurance. According to the Transgender Survey for New York, 26 percent of respondents reported experiencing a problem with their insurance within the previous year, such as being denied coverage for care related to gender transition or being denied coverage for routine care because they were transgender.143 Given this evidence, I find that Ms. B may be denied coverage for routine care by her insurer simply because she is transgender and that this risk increases the burden on her to privately finance her access to care.\n[90] Again, I find that Ms. B's employment and housing history lead to a well-founded inference that, by relocating to New York City, she may be unable to independently afford the costs of medical care that are not covered by insurance. Although she has accessed medical care in the past, I also find that Ms. B would not be immune to the fears or risks of mistreatment by medical practitioners because of her trans status. By relocating, she will, after all, have to find new sources of care when necessary.\n[91] The country documents show that fear and uncertainty around how one will be treated-whether entry, service, or use of bathroom facilities will be denied and whether they will be harassed-affects the way many trans individuals interact with the world and communities around them. These experiences push trans people out of public life by making it difficult or unsafe for them to do everyday things like go to stores, use public transportation, access healthcare and other essential services, or simply go to a restaurant to eat.144 Ms. B's experiences in different states in the US demonstrate that, despite her relative position of privilege as a white woman, she has nevertheless experienced many of the problems described in the evidence on the situation of trans people in the US.\n[92] Considered collectively, I find the evidence shows that trans individuals in New York continue to face high levels of discrimination, harassment and physical violence that affect their ability to live freely and with dignity. I find the evidence also shows that Ms. B would be at a disadvantage in establishing herself since there is no evidence that she has any existing social networks in New York City to help her find the housing and employment necessary for successful integration into the community. I find, for all of the above reasons, that relocation is unreasonable for Ms. B, given her particular profile and circumstances.\n[93] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that Ms. B is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nDilani Mohan\nDilani Mohan\nOctober 27, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit RAD-1, Notice to Appellant and Minister, dated March 2, 2022.\n2 Exhibit RAD-2, National Documentation Package (NDP) for the United States (February 3, 2022); Sarah Repucci, Freedom House, From Crisis to Reform A Call to Strengthen America's Battered Democracy, March 2021, US_Democracy_Report_FINAL_03222021.pdf (freedomhouse.org).\n3 Pursuant to Section 110(4), Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c.21, as amended.\n4 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration v.

XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of Rwanda.\n[2] The Appellant tried to seek justice for the death of her father and husband, who were both killed by the Rwandan army.\n[3] In 1996, the Appellant's family fled the DRC and sought refuge in Rwanda.\n[4] In 1998, the Appellant's father was killed by the Rwandan army because he was accused of working as a spy for the Mobutu regime in the DRC.\n[5] The Appellant tried to seek help from the police, without success.\n[6] In 2002, the Appellant obtained her Rwandan citizenship through her marriage to a soldier in the Rwandan army.\n[7] In 2011, the Appellant's husband refused to go to war. He was detained and killed because he was looking into her father's death. The Appellant's properties were seized, and she also received death threats.\n[8] In 2013, the Appellant left for Uganda and claimed asylum. She got deported back to Rwanda.\n[9] In 2016, the Appellant left Rwanda for Kenya for a month and returned to Rwanda.\n[10] In 2019, fearing the individuals that killed her father and husband, she came to Canada and filed a refugee claim.\n[11] On July 19, 2021, the RPD rejected the Appellant's asylum claim.\n[12] The determinative issue at the RAD is credibility.\nDECISION\n[13] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[14] On appeal, the Appellant submits Exhibits J, K, L, being two internet articles and a letter to support her credibility regarding the issue of her failure to claim asylum in Uganda, in Kenya and her re-availment which affected the RPD's credibility assessment, central to the RPD decision. The Appellant states in her supporting affidavit that she did not know that her asylum claims in Uganda and Kenya and her re-availment to Rwanda would be issues to be assessed at the RPD.\n[15] According to the Law, I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[16] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.\n[17] In considering whether the evidence arose after the rejection of the claim, the RAD will not restrict its analysis to date on the proposed new evidence. In the RAD's view, a document's \"newness\" cannot be tested solely by the date of its creation; what is important is the event or circumstance sought to be proved by the evidence.1 Old evidence remains old evidence, even if it is placed in a new document with a recent date.\n[18] The Appellant asks the RAD to admit the following evidence in this appeal:\n1. Exhibit J is an internet article: Abuses against Rwandan refugees in Uganda: Has time come for accountability dated on the 27th of August 2018 and Exhibit K is another internet article: Kenya: Global compact on refugees must be quickly anchored in national polity dated December 24, 2018.\n2. Exhibit L: Letter from daughter regarding the incident on XXXX XXXX, 2021. This document is dated XXXX XXXX, 2021.\nExhibit J and Exhibit K are rejected:\n[19] I note that these two internet articles are dated before the RPD decision dated July 19, 2021. These documents contain information about incidents that occurred before the hearing and the RPD decision. Thus, it is not about events that have occurred since the claim was rejected, but about the circumstances known at the time of the rejection of the decision dated July 19, 2021.\n[20] The Appellant submits in her supporting affidavit that she did not know that her asylum claims in Uganda and Kenya and her re-availment to Rwanda would be issues to be assessed at the RPD. I am of the view that the Appellant could reasonably have been expected to provide this information to the RPD, where she was represented by Counsel and where it was clear that her credibility and subjective fear were at issue. She has not established that these two articles were not reasonably available for presentation to the RPD.\n[21] As her credibility was clearly at issue, she could reasonably have been expected, in her circumstances, to provide evidence to corroborate the fact that she went back on two different occasions to the country she feared for her life. Moreover, the Appellant was also questioned regarding the asylum claims in Uganda and Kenya and her re-availment to Rwanda. Given the RPD's concern and questions regarding the discrepancy at the hearing, the Appellant ought to have known that the RPD may assess this evidence and make a finding that would be reflected in the reasons for its decision. Furthermore, the Appellant's Counsel addressed the discrepancy in her submissions before the RPD and the RPD rendered its decision and reasons approximately one month after the hearing.\n[22] The Appellant has not demonstrated that the documents proposed as new evidence could not have been provided to the RPD before her hearing or between the time of her hearing and the time the decision was rendered. Considering the above, the RAD finds that the Appellant could reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the document at the time of the rejection and thus will not be accepted as new evidence in this appeal. These documents do not meet the test in section 110(4). Therefore, these articles are rejected.\nExhibit L is rejected\n[23] I note the letter from the Appellant's daughter is regarding an incident that took place on XXXX XXXX, 2021, which arose after the RPD decision which is sufficient to meet the requirements for admissibility under s. 110(4). I have further analyzed the affidavit to assess the credibility, relevance and newness of the evidence.\n[24] I find that the documents must be rejected on the basis of credibility. The Federal Court has outlined the following test for determining the credibility of new evidence: \"Is the evidence credible, considering its sources and the circumstances in which it came into existence? If not, the new evidence need not be considered.\"2 To begin, I find that the timing of the alleged incident just over two weeks after the Appellant's claim was rejected calls into question her credibility. The Appellant's daughter states that there were previous incidents in which her sister and herself were threatened at gun point by people who were demanding the whereabouts of the Appellant, however corroborating evidence was not submitting to the RPD to this affect nor were the other previous incidents involving her daughters stated in her BOC. I note that the RPD attempted to understand if her children encountered issues, but the answers were vague and difficult to follow.\n[25] There was no credible allegation of any armed gun point incident involving her daughters. In certain circumstances, evidence that is the result of a \"suspiciously convenient\" \"extraordinary coincidence\" may be found to be implausible.3 While I am mindful that plausibility findings are to be reserved for the clearest of cases, I am also to consider whether new evidence is credible, considering its source and the circumstances in which it came into existence.4 I find that the timing of the alleged armed visit in this case is so suspiciously convenient as to undermine the credibility of the letter. I find that the evidence described above is not admissible.\nANALYSIS\n[26] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.5\n[27] After conducting my own analysis of the record, I am satisfied that the RPD was correct in finding that core aspects of Appellant's evidence lacked credibility, which is determinative of the appeal.\n[28] I note that the RPD reviewed and applied the IRB Chairperson's Guidelines No. 4 on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Gender Guidelines). The RPD did not accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant:\n* sought justice beyond making inquiries about her father's death between 1998 and 2002;\n* was pursued by the Rwandan state;\n* her husband was killed by the Rwandan army because he made inquiries about her father's death;\n* her properties were seized to silence her.\n[29] The RPD found that her return to Rwanda on two occasions undermined her allegations of ongoing threats by the government and her subjective fear. The RPD also found that the claimant provided insufficient evidence to support a finding that she is of interest to the authorities based on her ongoing search of justice for the death of her husband and father.\nProcedural fairness - Risks in Rwanda for seeking justice\n[30] The Appellant alleges that the RPD breached the rules of procedural fairness by not questioning her with respect to the inconsistencies regarding her risks in Rwanda for seeking justice for her father and husband's death.\n[31] I do not agree with the Appellant's submission.\n[32] Like the RPD, I note that the Appellant's BOC indicates that she sought justice for her father and her husband. In order to understand that statement, the RPD asked more specifically what she did to seek justice.6 She replied that she could not seek justice because \"the same people who had done the same thing are the same people that I was going to complain to or tell the issue to.\"7 The RPD member asked the Appellant to confirm that she took no steps to seek justice, she answered yes and explained that she did not take steps to seek justice because after her husband's death she encountered a lot of problems. Upon comparing what is written in her BOC and her testimony, one must recognize that the two versions are different and contradictory. Therefore, I draw a negative credibility inference.\n[33] Moreover, the RPD attempted to understand why the Appellant feared the Rwandan authorities given the fact that she obtained multiple government issued documents from them. The Appellant replied that she was lucky because a man who was a friend of her husband helped her out but was killed after. The RPD asked how she knew this man was killed, she replied that she was told.8 On a balance of probabilities, without more evidence establishing the death of the alleged man that helped her, I am of the opinion that this is speculation on her part.\n[34] In addition, The RPD questioned the Appellant about when she went to Uganda. The Appellant explained that she went to Uganda and sought asylum but was extradited back to Rwanda six months later following an agreement by Uganda and Rwanda. She also testified that when she learned that they were going to repatriate them again, she knew that if it happened again, she might face death. Questioned by the RPD as to why she thought she might face death, she replied that \"that's how the system works\".9 The objective documentation package indicates that Uganda has asylum policies and structures in place, therefore on a balance of probabilities, I am of the view the Appellant's explanation that she thought she might die based on how the system works is a conjecture on her part. I have insufficient evidence before me to establish that she might face death based on how the system works.\n[35] Moreover, the RPD, attempted to understand why if the Appellant feared the Rwandan government she returned to Rwanda from Kenya. The Appellant testifies that she stayed in Kenya for one month in 2016 and returned to Rwanda. Questioned by the RPD as to why she would return to Rwanda she indicated that someone told her that the Kenyan government was thinking of repatriating refugees. Given that the Appellant fears the Rwandan authorities for her life, I would have expected the Appellant to take further steps and attempt to make further inquiries about the information she heard from an acquaintance before deciding to return to a country where she fears for her life. Like the RPD. I find that the Appellant's return to Rwandan on two occasions, once in 2013 and once in 2016, undermines her subjective fear.\n[36] I also note that the Appellant renewed her Rwandan passport in 2016 and travelled in and out of Rwanda multiple times according to the stamps in her passport. By entering and leaving Rwanda, the Appellant encountered various Rwandan authorities but did not indicate that she had encountered any problems. Like the RPD indicated in its decision, there is no indication that the state ever restricted her movements which further undermine the Appellant's subjective fear.\n[37] Consequently, I am of the view that the RPD did not breach the rules of procedural fairness as the Appellant was questioned in various ways regarding her risks in Rwanda for seeking justice for her father and husband's death, but the Appellant did not provide satisfactory explanations to establish that she was of interest to Rwandan authorities.\n[38] The Appellant submits that the RPD breached the rules of procedural fairness by not giving her an opportunity to respond to its concern about having resided in the same neighbourhood and worked without problems.\n[39] I note that the RPD questioned the Appellant about living in the same neighbourhood, she replied that yes, she lived in the same area but had to find another home that was less expensive.10 I do not find that the Appellant's argument regarding the \"failure to give an opportunity to respond\" is an accurate construction of what happened at the RPD. I am of the view that the RPD construed that the neighbourhood as insufficiency of evidence that the Rwandan state is pursuing the Appellant, rather than an inconsistency or a credibility problem. Consequently, in my view the RPD did not commit an error of procedural fairness.\nPsychological Report\n[40] The Appellant argues that the RPD failed to give psychological report a meaningful consideration considering her depression and poor concentration problems.\n[41] I do not agree with the Appellant's submission.\n[42] A psychological report cannot be used to establish the credibility of the allegations of a person seeking asylum.11 In this respect, it should be stressed that it is not necessary to be a victim of post-traumatic stress disorder or to have been exposed to torture to be recognized as a refugee or as a person in need of protection. In other words, a psychological report cannot be used as an instrument to assess the truth of an asylum seeker's story. But the psychological state of health of that person, including the suffering he or she may be experiencing, must be considered in assessing the credibility of his or her story and his or her fear of persecution, torture, or threat to life, if he or she were to return to his or her country of origin.\n[43] I listened carefully to the recording of the hearing and found that the Member used a calm tone in her questioning and a trauma-sensitive manner in addressing the Appellant. She also ensured that breaks were taken at appropriate times. I also note that the RPD applied the Gender Guidelines, took in consideration the report by the psychotherapist that found that the Appellant's symptoms were consistent with depression. I also note that no accommodation request was made by her Counsel nor stated in the submitted psychological report. The question is ultimately whether the contradictions between the Appellant's testimony at the hearing and what she wrote in her BOC undermine her credibility, considering the psychological report.\n[44] According to the jurisprudence, it is well understood that a claimant can explain contradictions, inconsistencies, and gaps in his or her version of events. That being said, the decision-maker remains free to assess the answers given and to say whether they are adequate or not. Furthermore, it is well recognized that a decision maker is permitted to assess the credibility of a claimant by comparing the evidence produced by the claimant in various interviews, the BOC and the testimony given at the hearing. Moreover, even where there is a psychological report that establishes the existence of a condition that makes the claimant vulnerable, disoriented, or anxious when interviewed, this does not explain glaring contradictions or significant discrepancies between the various pieces of evidence. When faced with a series of documents, the decision maker may give more weight to some of them than to others.\n[45] In this regard, I find it useful to recall that, according to the case law, it is permissible for an administrative tribunal decision maker to reject or give no probative value to evidence that merely repeats a version of the facts that he or she has previously found to be implausible. I note that the RPD showed sensitivity to the Appellant's situation and was gentle and tactful in her questioning. I also note, having listened to the recording of the hearing that there is no suggestion that the Appellant did not understand the nature of the proceedings.\n[46] I would have expected there to be satisfactory explanations for her return to Rwanda on two occasions, the fact that she indicates in her BOC that she sought justice, the documents obtained by the Rwandan government, for the reason why she thought the Rwandan government was the agent of persecution, but she did not. For these reasons, I draw a negative inference as to the credibility of her alleged fear.\nThe RPD was not overzealous\n[47] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in being overzealous about the problems she experienced between 2013 and 2018.\n[48] I do not agree with the Appellant's submission.\n[49] Having listened carefully to the recording of the hearing and read the transcript, I did not find that the RPD was overly harsh and scrutinized, giving undue weight to certain immaterial elements. I note that the RPD did indicate in paragraph 54 of its decision that it had analysed all the evidence. I also note that throughout the hearing, the RPD asked several questions regarding the alleges threats received between 2013 and 2018 and asked the Appellant to be specific but her answers were vague, contradictory, and difficult to follow. For example, when the RPD asked when the last time she received a threat was, the claimant testified that it was at the end of 2012 beginning of 2013 while later in the hearing she stated that the problems never stopped, and the threats continued until 2018. The RPD confronted the Appellant on this contradiction, she then stated that the threats did not stop in 2013 they became worse. When we compare the Appellant's answers once must recognize that two versions are different. Consequently, like the RPD, I am of the opinion that the Appellant provided contradictory testimony which affects her credibility.\n[50] Moreover, when the RPD asked if her children had any issues in Rwandan since 2013 the claimant was vague in her response stating that every problem that she encountered had an effect on them. Again, I note that the RPD asked the Appellant to be more specific, but she did not provide more specific information regarding the problems encountered by her children.\n[51] In addition, the RPD questioned the Appellant about the event occurred in 2018 or 2019 that led to the claimant seeking asylum in Canada she testified that she was not at peace. When the Appellant's Counsel questioned the claimant regarding the threats, she allegedly received she testified that the first threat was after her father died and that it got worse after her husband died. She stated that the threats stopped sometime in 2018. She also testified that men with guns came to her home in 20l8 and told her to keep quiet or she would encounter a lot of problems. When the RPD asked why this was not in her BOC, the Appellant explained that she referred to threats in her BOC and that she could explain what the threats were at the hearing.\n[52] In my view, the omission is problematic, considering that the RPD is noted on the record to have encouraged the Appellant to make any amendments to her BOC at the beginning of the hearing. Furthermore, she affirmed at the outset of the hearing that she had no amendments to bring to the BOC with respect to her claim. I do not find the answer satisfactory as being threatened with a gun at her house are all central elements of her claim. The Appellant's failure to include this information in her BOC undermines her credibility. I would have expected the appellant to mention the most recent threat and remember if the threats started after her father was killed or after her husband died or if they had been ongoing. In my view, the three different versions of when the threats started and ended undermine the Appellant's credibility.\n[53] Therefore, I consider that it was incumbent upon the Appellant and her Counsel to support her allegations with evidence that could have confirmed that her life is in danger. I am of the opinion that the RPD considered all of the evidence in the record as well as the testimony in order to weigh the facts and evidence in the case at bar.\n[54] There is no evidence on the record that allows me to conclude that the RPD acted lightly, was overly harsh, and scrutinized her testimony by giving undue weight to certain unimportant elements. Accordingly, the RPD did not err in drawing a negative inference about its credibility with respect to her subjective fear.\nCountry conditions\n[55] The Appellant submits that the RPD failed to take into consideration the behaviour of the regime in targeting those perceived as opponents and failed to properly consider the country conditions documentation.\n[56] The RPD is presumed to have considered all of the evidence before it, and there is no requirement for the panel to refer to each document in the record.12 The RPD did not dispute the regime in targeting those perceived as opponents in Rwanda. It simply did not believe that the Appellant was of interest to the authorities based on her ongoing search of justice for the death of her husband and father. As such, even objective evidence about persecution of people perceived as opponents in Rwanda could not have led to a different determination of the claim. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant failed to establish she was similarly situated to the people who suffer the persecution described in the independent documentary evidence.\nFear as a single woman.\n[57] The RPD analyzed the Appellant's prospective risk as a woman and concluded that the evidence did not support a finding of a serious possibility of persecution in the event of a return to Rwanda. In her submission, the Appellant does not challenge the RPD's finding in this regard. Having assessed all of the documentary evidence, taking into account the Appellant's personal and family circumstances, her education and the IRB Chairperson's Guidelines No. 4 on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Guidelines), I agree with the RPD that the Appellant has not established a serious possibility of persecution in the event of return to Rwanda because of her gender.\nCONCLUSION\n[58] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPascale Aubin\nPascale Aubin\nJanuary 18, 2022\nDate\n1 Raza v.

They appeal the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their claim for refugee protection. The Appellants ask that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) substitute a finding that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Alternatively, the Appellants ask that the RAD refer the matter back to a differently constituted panel of the RPD for redetermination.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The determinative issue is the availability of an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Port Harcourt.\n[3] In addition to Port Harcourt, the RPD also considered Benin City, Abuja and Ibadan as viable IFAs, but I find that it is not necessary to consider these locations as Port Harcourt is a more suitable IFA and only one is necessary. In addition, the RPD made several adverse credibility findings regarding re-availment, a lack of subjective fear, and several omissions from the Appellants' Basis of Claim form (BOC).\n[4] It is well established that \"in general, it is not an error to move immediately to an IFA analysis provided that analysis considers a claimant's particular situation, and the testamentary and documentary evidence before the tribunal.\"1 I find it unnecessary to assess the credibility of the Appellants in this instance because, on a balance of probabilities, the IFA is available to them in any case. Without making a finding and for the purposes of the IFA analysis I consider the Appellants' evidence credible except where I make specific findings to the contrary.\n[5] Similarly, the Appellants raised several issues of procedural fairness including a lack of questioning by the RPD regarding the Principal Appellant's sibling's ability to care for his ailing father, a lack of questions regarding the relationship between the friend (Mr. XXXX) and the law firm that represented the Principal Appellant in Nigeria, and a lack of questioning regarding omissions from the BOC. However, these matters do not impact the determinative issue of an IFA. The procedural fairness issues raised are related to credibility findings and are therefore not addressed in this decision.\nBACKGROUND\n[6] The Appellants allege that they fear returning to Nigeria because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the traditionalists) will force them to participate in a rite or ritual because the Principal Appellant was responsible for their arrest and brief detention in 2017.\n[7] Against his wishes, the Principal Appellant's daughter underwent Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) at the hands of the traditionalists. After this, and because of this, she became ill and died in September 2017. The Principal Appellant reported the traditionalists that were responsible to the police in a neighboring region. They were arrested and detained but released shortly thereafter. The police took no further action.\n[8] The Appellants allege a fear of retribution by the traditionalists as a result of their detention and arrest. Specifically, the Principal Appellant alleges that he was told he must submit to a ritual or rite by way of atonement.\n[9] The Appellants submit no new evidence and do not request an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[10] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2\nInternal flight alternative\n[11] I find that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Port Harcourt.\n[12] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Rasaratnam.3\n(1) The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.\n[13] Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellants to show that there is no IFA. The finding of an IFA must be based on a distinct evaluation of the region for that purpose taking into account the Appellants' personal circumstances.\nThe Appellants did not Establish that they face a Section 96 or 97 risk in Port Harcourt\n[14] Having identified an IFA, the burden is on the Appellants to show that either of the two prongs of the Rasaratnam test are not met. I find that there is insufficient evidence on the record to suggest that the traditionalists would have the reach or influence to locate the Appellants in Port Harcourt, or that they would be able to enlist the police or other political sources to conduct a national search for the Appellants.\n[15] The Appellants allege that the RPD did not properly address the evidence regarding the ability of the traditionalists to locate them in Port Harcourt. The Appellants argue that they would face a serious possibility of persecution in all of the IFAs identified by the RPD, including Port Harcourt.\n[16] More specifically, the Appellants state that the traditionalists have demonstrated their means and motivation to find the Appellants wherever they may relocate because their home in Lagos was ransacked by \"thugs\" engaged by the traditionalists. This is addressed in the affidavit of Mr. XXXX4 and the letter from the law firm.\n[17] In addition, the Appellants argue that the traditionalists have demonstrated control over the police in their ability to be released after their arrest without any additional action or prosecution. The Appellants rely on country documentary evidence that states that corruption is widespread in Nigeria,5 and make the argument that it is therefore \"obvious\" that the traditionalists will be capable of bribing officials by rendering \"spiritual services in exchange for\" favours allowing the traditionalists unrestricted influence, including the ability to locate and persecute them in any city.6\n[18] I do not agree that the evidence makes it obvious that the traditionalists wield such influence. After the traditionalists' release from police custody, the Appellants returned to Nigeria from XXXX to XXXX 2018. The traditionalists approached him and expressed that he must engage in a rite or ritual. No other action was taken against him or his family at that time.\n[19] The traditionalists took no action until January 2020 when Mr. XXXX confronted the traditionalists, for which time he was beaten and his life was threatened.7 After this confrontation, Mr. XXXX fled to the Appellants' residence in Lagos. According to his affidavit, he was \"traced\" to this location.8 That is, it was not until the traditionalists were directly confronted that they became alerted to the Appellants' other residence and sought to confront the Principal Appellant at that location. When they attended the Lagos residence, seeking the Appellants, Mr. XXXX informed the traditionalists that they were in Canada. There is no evidence of any additional attempt to locate or contact the Appellants after this interaction.\n[20] The Appellants stress that the traditionalists demonstrated their means and motivation by pursuing the Principal Appellant to Lagos, having crossed three states to arrive there.9 However, as outlined above, I find that this action was triggered by Mr. XXXX confrontation and was not undertaken spontaneously. The incident appears to have been a reaction to Mr. XXXX engagement as described in his affidavit.\n[21] The Appellants also argue that the traditionalists' resolve to find the Principal Appellant is renewed following the death of his father, who was able to keep a relative peace. However, there is no indication that any further action has been taken to locate or persecute the Appellants after the incident in Lagos involving Mr. XXXX.\n[22] Mr. XXXX also attested that \"the Nigerian police would be unable to protect\" the Appellants,10 and the Appellants argue that this information ought to be taken at face value, especially because there were no arrests made following the ransacking at the Lagos residence. However, I find this irreconcilable with the fact that the police in a neighbouring district arrested the traditionalists at the Principal Appellant's request. I find that any influence that the traditionalists have on police or public officials is localized.\n[23] In addition, I note that Mr. XXXX and the law firm indicate that the individuals involved in the ransacking at the Lagos residence were \"unknown\". Though they also indicate that \"investigations\" resulted in a connection to the traditionalists there were no details provided of any detail of any investigation. It is unclear what basis the police would have had to pursue any charges against unknown individuals. I do not agree with the Appellants that the lack of arrest following this incident establishes an inability or unwillingness of the police to act.\n[24] The lawyer retained by the Appellants also provided an affidavit and indicated that the traditionalists \"may not be easily apprehended... as they were well connected to prominent politicians\".11 However, the Appellants were not able to name, or identify by position, any politician associated with the traditionalists. When the Principal Appellant asked for intervention and arrest of the traditionalists from a neighbouring district's police, they were arrested. While they were released locally, this suggests their influence is limited geographically.\n[25] Therefore, I agree with the RPD's conclusion that, provided the Appellants do not return to their residences in Ado-Ekiti or Lagos, the traditionalists lack the means or motivation to locate the Appellants on a balance of probabilities. I find that the Appellants provided insufficient evidence to establish the means and motivation of the traditionalists.\nNature of the Appellants' business\n[26] The Appellants also assert that they will be easily located because of the nature of their businesses, in that they deal with the public, and that the popularity of the Principal Appellant's father before his death, make them more easily locatable. The Principal Appellant's father is now deceased. The evidence does not establish that his popularity was so great nationally as to make his family easily identifiable. The evidence also does not establish that the Appellants' must continue in the same business as previously, nor that doing so will expose them to any greater harm from the traditionalists.\nImpact of social media\n[27] The Appellants also argue that the RPD erred in failing to consider the impact of social media to their safety in any IFA. Because they may make posts to social media, they argue that they may be tracked by the traditionalists to any place they might relocate. Social media may be controlled by its author and kept private if necessary. This issue has been addressed by the Federal Court who upheld the RPD's decision that an individual could keep social media information private and that this \"was not akin to living as a fugitive\".12 It follows that I do not consider this tantamount to requiring the Appellants to go into hiding or to be unduly harsh or unreasonable.\nThe Appellants did not establish that it is objectively unreasonable for them to relocate to Port Harcourt\n[28] In the former Jurisprudential Guide, which continues to be a Decision of interest with respect to the framework of analysis for an IFA, the RAD held \"there are several very large, multilingual, multiethnic cities in south and central Nigeria\"13, including Port Harcourt, where individuals fearing non-state actors may safely relocate depending upon their circumstances. The Court has held that there is a high threshold for the unreasonableness test, requiring nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant, and concrete evidence of such conditions.14\n[29] There are a range of issues that impact the reasonableness of a proposed IFA with respect to any particular appellant, including: transportation and travel, language, education and employment, accommodation, religion, indigeneship status, and the availability of medical and mental healthcare. The National Documentation Package (NDP) indicates that \"internal migration within Nigeria is the norm\" and large cities are more ethnically and religiously diverse.15\n[30] The Appellants and the RPD raised the application of the Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Gender Guidelines) in the claim. The Gender Guidelines specifically instructs that decision-makers should \"take into account factors including religious, economic and cultural factors, and consider whether and how these factors affect women in the IFA.\"16 I have considered the Gender Guidelines in making this decision. I will review the factors above as they relate to the Appellants' specific circumstances in Port Harcourt.\nTransportation and travel\n[31] In analyzing the viability of the proposed IFA, consideration was given to the Gender Guidelines, which states:\nIn determining the reasonableness of a woman's recourse to an internal flight alternative (IFA), decision-makers should consider the ability of women, because of their gender, to travel safely to the IFA and to stay there without facing undue hardship.\nThe Associate Appellant will be accompanied by a male family member, the Principal Appellant. Further, Nigeria is a large country with an area of over 900,000 square kilometres and a population greater than 200 million people. The documentary evidence shows that all main centres are linked by road; in addition, Port Harcourt has an international airport so that travel to Port Harcourt could be completed directly. All of which mitigates in favour of the viability of the proposed IFA in terms of transit and travel for a given appellant without facing undue hardship.17\nLanguage\n[32] English is the official language in Nigeria, and the European Union's European Asylum Support Office (EASO) indicates that there is no language barrier in cities such as Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt unless the person is not English-speaking.18 The Appellants are fluent in English and Yoruba. Given that the Appellants are fluent in two languages spoken in Port Harcourt, this is not a factor that suggests the IFA is unreasonable.\nEducation and employment\n[33] The documentary evidence indicates that there is a high rate of unemployment in Nigeria generally, and that obtaining employment can be difficult. The total years of education completed on average for Nigerian men is nine years, whereas for women it is eight years.19 Both the Principal Appellant and Associate Appellant have completed post-secondary education and have meaningful work experience. The Principal Appellant completed an XXXX XXXX and worked in XXXX and had a XXXX XXXX in Nigeria. While in Canada he has been employed in a factory, demonstrating adaptability and transference of skills. The Associate Appellant completed a diploma in XXXX and worked in XXXX in Nigeria. I find that the Appellants are likely in a better position in terms of securing employment, where such opportunities exist, than the average Nigerian based on their education and work experience. Thus, I find that the Appellants' personal circumstances do not fall below the standard of \"undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life\" which the Federal Court identified.20\nAccommodation\n[34] The Appellants mentioned two residences in the RPD hearing. The first in Ado-Ekiti, where the traditionalists are based. The second in Lagos, a larger city. The Principal Appellant testified that this was an apartment he kept. The RPD determined that the Appellants kept two residences. This finding was not challenged by the Appellants in appeal. The documentary evidence is mixed on the impact of idegeneship on accommodation, noting that \"non-indegeneity does not necessarily influence access to housing\", but also that \"accommodation is a 'major obstacle' if the person is not 'financially strong'\".21 I find that the Appellants previously located accommodation when necessary in another city (Lagos) and therefore find it likely that they are able to do so again if necessary. The Appellants did not demonstrate that locating or securing accommodation in the proposed IFA is unreasonable or unduly harsh in their particular case.\nReligion\n[35] Religious affiliation in Nigeria is \"roughly evenly divided between Muslims and Christians\".22 The Appellants are Christian. The Appellants would therefore not be in a minority religious group in Port Harcourt and would likely have access to places of worship and other people who share their religious values. This factor does not weigh against the reasonableness of the IFA.\nIndigeneship\n[36] The Appellants argue that indigeneship is a strong factor weighing against their ability to move to Port Harcourt. Specifically, because they are not indigenes of the state and that their Yoruba ethnicity would not only be apparent but would preclude employment opportunities and create undue hardship. The Appellants argue that the RPD ignored indigeneity issues and correctly noted that the documentation shows an ethnic group can be identified by locals of another area as an outsider. Not only this, but employment can be more difficult for migrants.\n[37] However, I find that the RPD was not incorrect in its assessment of the IFA. While there is an ability to recognize outsiders and the documentation indicates this can lead to some limits, the documentation also includes a report cited by EASO concluding that \"'[i]n most cosmopolitan and urban Nigerian cities, issues of indigeneity [are]... nonexistent'\" except in local government opportunities or the \"'political arena'\".23 The Appellants are not engaged in these pursuits.\n[38] Non-indigenes are entitled to access essential public services. Although the evidence is mixed, it is clear that due to significant migration to large, urban cities, indigeneship is not a significant barrier to relocation in these cities. Again, the Appellants bear the onus to show that they would face discrimination in Port Harcourt on the basis of their ethnicity or non-indigeneship rising to the level that it would render the proposed IFA unreasonable or unduly harsh. This is a high threshold established by the Court. I find they did not do so on a balance of probabilities.\nMedical and mental health care\n[39] The Appellants did not raise the issue of access to medical or mental health care. The documentation indicates that access to health care in the southern region, like Port Harcourt, may be privatized and costly.24 I do not consider this as evidence that the IFA is unreasonable in the Appellants' particular circumstances.\nCrime rate\n[40] The Appellants also raised the issue that it is unsafe in Nigeria as a result of elevated crime and an inability or unwillingness of the police to protect them including a lack of response to complaints of domestic violence against female complainants, for example.25 The RPD held that similar issues (high crime rate, kidnapping, corruption and fear of violence) amount to generalized risk faced by most of the population and are not specific to the Appellants.26 I note also that there is no indication that the Associate Appellant will in this instance be subjected to domestic violence by the other Appellants. Though the Appellants argue that the traditionalists may be treated as \"tribesmen\" no evidence was provided to show that this amounts to domestic violence from a police perspective nor that violence against the Appellants as a group would be trivialized or disregarded as some violence against women may be. As described above, neighbouring police showed no hesitation in acting against the traditionalists previously.\n[41] The concept of an IFA is an inherent part of the Convention refugee definition because a claimant must be a refugee from a country, not from a particular region of a country. The presence of an IFA is therefore fatal to a refugee claim.\n[42] Having reviewed the entire record, including the Appellants' testimony, the documentary evidence and the information available in the NDP and the documents filed by the Appellants, I agree with the RPD that Port Harcourt offers the Appellants a viable IFA within Nigeria; the Appellants' claim fails on this basis.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nNathan Ferguson\nNathan Ferguson\nJanuary 6, 2022\nDate\n1 Dakpokpo v.

The appellant, XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Russia and originally from the city of Lesnoy in the Ural federal district. Before leaving Russia, she was living and working in the city of Perm, also located in the Ural federal district. The appellant says that if she returns to Russia, she fears being killed by unknown persons who she believes are linked to the police after she witnessed an altercation that led to a man's death in XXXX 2017.\n* Findings of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD)\n[2] The RPD held that the appellant had an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Vladivostok. More specifically, it found that the appellant had failed to discharge her burden of proving that the agents of harm were linked to the police or that they had the means to find her. It also found that the proposed IFA would be reasonable, given her specific circumstances.\n* Reasons for appeal\n[3] The appellant is contesting the RPD's conclusions as to the viability of an IFA in Vladivostok. The RPD's main arguments can be summarized as follows:1\n- The RPD erred in its conclusion as to the identity of the agents of harm by deeming them to be not linked to the police, given the appellant's testimony, which was deemed to be credible, to the effect that she purportedly saw one of the them at liberty at the police station and in a discussion with a police officer after having committed a crime for which he was being sought after.\n- The RPD erred in refusing to consider the evidence concerning corruption in Russia, since it is an important element because, according to the documentary evidence, the Russian government is corrupt at all levels.\n- It is very easy to track any citizen in Russia by using the registration system in effect.\n* Notice of new issues raised on appeal\n[4] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) notified the appellant as well as the Minister that new issues pertaining to credibility would be reviewed in the course of the appeal. This notice provided an opportunity to make additional submissions.2 The appellant's written submissions were received in response to the credibility issue,3 and I took them into account in this decision.\n* Determinative issues\n[5] The determinative issues before the RAD concern credibility and the existence of a viable IFA in Vladivostok.\nBACKGROUND\n[6] The appellant, her spouse and their children have their related files before the RPD, but the application from other family members who arrived in Canada through the United States could not be included in an appeal before the RAD, pursuant to paragraph 110(2)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[7] The appellant alleges having witnessed an altercation between unknown persons that led to the death of a man in XXXX 2017. She alleges that she was in front of a restaurant with a co-worker named XXXX, who she did not know very well, and that they both saw a man getting beaten. She then purportedly heard that he had died.\n[8] Shortly after, she was called into the police station to make a witness statement. She says that at the police station, she saw one of the men involved in the altercation at the police station talking with one of the police officers.\n[9] She alleges that she later received threats on the telephone in which she was told to withdraw her statement, and that in XXXX 2017, an unknown man purportedly came to her home for the same reason, and he purportedly hit her. When she tried to file a complaint, the police officer purportedly came to her home in a state of inebriation, and she abandoned the filing of a complaint.\n[10] Afterwards, the appellant took steps to visit her friend in Canada and left permanently in XXXX 2017. After her departure, she also learned that her co-worker XXXX, who had disappeared, had been found dead.\n[11] Following her departure, her spouse, who had stayed in Russia with their two children, purportedly began receiving numerous threats by telephone.\n[12] He eventually moved to another address in Perm, then to one in Lesnoy, where he is also from, after an unknown man asked their daughter where her mother was.\n[13] Also, in Lesnoy, two unknown men purportedly questioned the appellant's spouse aggressively to find out where she was in XXXX 2019, and their son purportedly suffered an arm injury during this incident.\n[14] Lastly, in XXXX 2019, the appellant's spouse and her daughter went to Israel to apply for visas to the United States, which they obtained. They then returned to Russia before leaving permanently in XXXX 2019.\nTHE RAD'S ROLE\n[15] The standard of review applied in this appeal is the correctness standard.4 I carried out an independent review of the evidence, including the recording of the hearing before the RPD and the appellant's file. The appellant did not submit new evidence or request a hearing before the RAD.\nANALYSIS\ni. The RPD correctly concluded that the agents of harm are not linked to the police.\na) The appellant failed to establish that she saw one of the agents of harm again at the police station in XXXX 2017\n[16] The appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of the identity of the agents of harm because the evidence demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that they were police officers or persons with links to police officers. The appellant said that, although it is true that she cannot prove that the agents of harm are police officers, the fact that she saw at the police station one of the men involved in the incident in XXXX 2017 and the manner in which he addressed the police officer was sufficient to establish this link. The RPD erred in concluding otherwise. As a result, the RPD erred in believing that there were several other ways in which the appellant could be found, and that it was not necessarily by police officers.\n[17] In the course of my own independent analysis of the evidence in the record, I noted that there were several discrepancies with respect to the alleged events at the police station in XXXX 2017.\n[18] First of all, the appellant stated in the written narrative appended to her initial Basis of Claim (BOC) form, dated in December 2018, that she had noticed her agent of harm in the corridor of the police station, that he was dressed in civilian clothes and that he was speaking rudely to one of the police officers.5\n[19] Then, in item 2(b) on her amended BOC form, dated in December 2019, the appellant says that she and the other witness recognized the agent of harm at the police station and that he \"was wearing the insignia of a higher rank.\"6\n[20] Lastly, during her testimony, the appellant stated that she was alone in the corridor when she noticed her agent of harm, who was not dressed in a police officer's uniform, speaking rudely to one of the police officers.7\n[21] A Notice of New Issues was sent to the appellant, which gave her an opportunity to make additional submissions regarding these inconsistencies. In these additional submissions, the appellant argues that she went to the police station and recognized one of the men in the corridor. He was dressed in civilian clothes and not in a police officer's uniform. However, he was acting in such a way that he clearly seemed to be higher ranking than the police officers to whom he was speaking. The appellant was not at the police station with her co-worker, but they spoke afterwards and said to each other that they had the same impression of this man.\n[22] I do not find this to be a sufficient or a convincing explanation.\n[23] On the one hand, the appellant simply reiterated her testimony before the RPD, without providing an explanation about the fact that she had submitted an amendment, one year after her initial written narrative, stating contradictory information as to the way in which her agent of harm was dressed (he \"was wearing the insignia of a higher rank.\"), as well as the fact that she and the other witness (her co-worker, XXXX) purportedly saw and recognized him at the police station. She was assisted by her counsel's interpreter when she submitted this amended BOC form.8\n[24] On the other hand, she now explains that she talked to her co-worker with whom she shared her impression of the agent of harm after she had been in the police station. However, this directly contradicts her testimony that she did not communicate with her co-worker after the night of the altercation.9 I therefore cannot accept this explanation.\n[25] In light of all of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the appellant failed to establish in a credible manner, on a balance of probabilities, that she saw one of her agents of harm at the police station.\n[26] In brief, I am of the opinion that the facts that would have enabled the appellant to conclude that her agents of harm were police officers or linked to the police were not established in a credible manner.\nb) The facts linked to the attack on the appellant's son, after her departure, were not established as alleged\n[27] The RPD also concluded that the absence of a link between the agents of harm and the police was supplemented by the lack of credibility of the allegations of the appellant's spouse that a police officer was purportedly involved in the violent attack on her young son in XXXX 2019, after the appellant's departure. In particular, in paragraphs 19 to 21 of her reasons, the RPD notes several inconsistencies between the testimony and the appellant's spouse's BOC form regarding the events that occurred following this incident, when he tried to file a complaint.\n[28] The RPD concluded, based on paragraphs 24 and 25 of her reasons, that the appellant and her spouse had tried to embellish their testimony in order to establish a link between their agents of harm and the police. The RPD considered the agents of harm to be unknown persons with no established link with the police. I agree with this conclusion for the same reasons as those of the RPD. I have not identified any error and I note that the appellant is not specifically contesting the RPD's conclusions regarding the attack on her son in XXXX 2019.\n[29] In my opinion, the many inconsistencies noted in this regard render this incident not credible, especially given that the appellant had testified that this incident purportedly took place in XXXX 2019 and that it was the date of the last contact between her spouse and the agents of harm10-as also stated on her spouse's BOC form11-when the medical report provided as evidence demonstrating that her son suffered an arm injury states instead that the injury was sustained in XXXX 2019 without stating the circumstances of the injury.12 In my opinion, this report only demonstrates that the appellant's son sustained an arm injury in XXXX 2019, just like the photo submitted as evidence showing him with a cast on his arm.\n[30] Although this additional inconsistency with the medical report was not mentioned during the hearing before the RPD, I believe that the appellant was familiar with the content of the documents that she herself submitted as evidence.13 14 In any case, this inconsistency simply supplements those already identified by the RPD. My conclusion is that the incident in XXXX 2019 has not been established in a credible manner.\nc) Conclusion as to the absence of a link with the police\n[31] In addition, the presumption of truthfulness does not extend to simple subjective statements linking the persecutors to an expanded network that is not in any way supported by the evidence.15\n[32] In that regard, the RPD had concluded that the fact that the agents of harm could have found her address in order to threaten her in order to get her to withdraw her testimony or the fact that one of the police officers who came to deal with her subsequent complaint was in a state of inebriation were not sufficient indications to establish a link between the agents of harm and the police, and that there were several possible explanations. I agree.\n[33] It is possible that she was followed after the incident or when leaving the police station or that this information was obtained by asking other people (e.g., her co-workers in the restaurant on the evening of the incident).\n[34] I also note that the death of her co-worker, XXXX, is reported in the article submitted as evidence as being related to a quarrel with her lover,16 and the appellant has no information or evidence indicating the contrary, other than her subjective belief that the circumstances of her death are related to this matter.\n[35] In Azzam,17 Justice Grammond states that \"Evidence is said to be sufficient if it meets the burden of proof. Given that, in immigration matters, that burden is on a balance of probabilities standard, evidence will only be deemed sufficient if makes the existence of the fact at issue \"more likely than not\" - which is the definition of the balance of probabilities standard.\" Like the RPD, I am of the opinion that the appellant did not submit sufficient, credible evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, a possible involvement of the agents of harm with the police to find her.\n[36] To sum up, in the light of the foregoing, the RPD did not err in concluding that there was no link between the agents of harm and the police.\nii. The RPD correctly concluded that there is a viable IFA in Vladivostok.\n[37] I am of the opinion that the existence of a viable IFA in Vladivostok is determinative.\n[38] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test in the review of the IFA in Rasaratnam:18\n- Part 1: Absence of a serious possibility of persecution or of being personally subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a threat to one's life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the locations proposed as IFAs (a); and\n- Part 2: The reasonableness of the IFA given all of the circumstances (b).\na) Part 1 of the IFA test: The appellant failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or a future risk of harm\n[39] In addition to the arguments linked to the fact that the agents of harm were linked to the police, which I dismissed for the previously cited reasons, the appellant argues that the RPD erred in refusing to consider the evidence concerning corruption in Russia, because it is an important element since the documentary evidence demonstrates that the Russian government is corrupt at all levels. She argues that it is very easy to track any citizen in Russia by using the registration system in effect and that anyone can obtain information on the appellant and her family members, whether they are police officers, persons linked to police officers or any other person who can easily corrupt the Russian government.\n[40] I agree with the appellant that the documentary evidence demonstrates that corruption is indeed an endemic problem in Russia and that the RPD should have taken a closer look at this issue in its reasons. I have taken the relevant documentary evidence into account.\n[41] However, I do not believe, on a balance of probabilities, that nearly five years after the alleged facts and more than two years after the departure of her spouse and children, the agents of harm would still be looking for the appellant and that for that purpose, they would still try to bribe and corrupt public servants in order to find her through the registry kept by the federal migration service (FMS) of the Ministry of the Interior or that they would be alerted of her return to Russia through the use of these same methods.\n[42] The RPD had noted that Vladivostok is a city located more than 5,000 km from Perm, and the appellant had confirmed that she had no previous link or family in that city. Nothing suggests that the agents of harm would think to look for her there either, several years after her departure.\n[43] This is also supported by the fact that the appellant owns an apartment in the city of Lesnoy (located 300 to 400 km from Perm) and several members of her family also live in that city, but to her knowledge, the agents of harm did not try to go there to look for her. The appellant had explained this by saying that the agents of harm did not have any information to contact her family, which was in a city other than theirs.19 The RPD felt that this was an indication instead that the agents of harm did not have access to information related to the registration of addresses and I agree.\n[44] I have already explained why I did not accept the non-credible allegations that the appellant's spouse was found and threatened by the agents of harm in XXXX 2019, after having moved to Lesnoy (see above: i.(b)). It is therefore not established that the agents of harm had the means to find the appellant and her family in another city or region in Russia.\n[45] There is also no indication either that an investigation of the incident in XXXX 2017 was still underway or that the police had followed up on the matter further since she submitted her witness statement in XXXX 2017.\n[46] Indeed, the documentary evidence cited by the appellant says that crime investigators accept bribes to open or close criminal investigations, free inmates or detain people temporarily.20 This evidence also says that the settlement of a matter with bribes, particularly criminal matters, can be \"resolved\" through negotiations with the investigators and the prosecutor before the matter goes to court.21\n[47] In these circumstances, it is difficult to see the agents of harm waiting for five years for the appellant to return by bribing public servants to obtain access to her new address without having looked for her in the city of her birth or having approached her family living in Russia, and at the same time, not having taken any steps to get the criminal investigation file closed.\n[48] Given the profile of the wrongdoers, who are not themselves established as persons in positions of considerable influence, I believe that the evidence demonstrates instead that the passage of time would have significantly reduced the risk of reprisals for the appellant.\n[49] I therefore believe that the evidence is insufficient to establish that the agents of harm have both the means and the motivation to look for the appellant as far as Vladivostok today or that they would be alerted of her return to Russia or motivated to look for her if she returns.\n[50] Like the RPD, I therefore conclude that the appellant failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, of being harmed in Vladivostok within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. This conclusion was correct.\n[51] For all of these reasons, I believe that Part 1 of the IFA test is satisfied because it has not been established that there was a serious possibility of persecution or that the appellant might personally face a threat to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, on a balance of probabilities, in Vladivostok.\nb) Part 2: The IFA is not unreasonable\n[52] The Federal Court of Appeal has established a very high threshold for determining what is unreasonable.22 Nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the appellant's life and safety is required. Actual, concrete evidence of such conditions is required.23\n[53] In this case, the RPD believed that it would not be unreasonable for the appellant to move to Vladivostok, given the evidence demonstrating that the law gives citizens the right to chose where they live. However, adult citizens must have an internal passport issued by the government and must register with the local authorities after their arrival in another location. The RPD also believed that the appellant would be able to find a job and a place to live and be able to support herself once she had registered with the authorities. I agree and I have not identified any error.\n[54] The appellant argues in her memorandum that she and her spouse are young parents and that they will be required to register in order to function within the system, rent an apartment, work, send their children to school and obtain medical and other services.\n[55] I have already explained above that registering with the local authorities in Vladivostok would not put the appellant at risk of being found by her agents of harm today. In addition, the appellant did not submit any additional argument on appeal to demonstrate that she would be unable to provide for her basic needs in the IFA. There is no \"actual, concrete\" evidence in the record to demonstrate otherwise.\n[56] For these reasons, I am of the opinion that, based on the evidence, the conclusion cannot be drawn that there are conditions that would imperil the appellant's life or safety in Vladivostok.\n[57] My conclusion is that the appellant failed to establish that she would face a serious possibility of persecution or be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if she moved to Vladivostok and that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for the claimant to seek refuge there.\nCONCLUSION\n[58] For all of these reasons, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant had a viable IFA in Vladivostok if she returned to Russia.\nDECISION\n[59] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the appellant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nFebruary 7, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 E-2, Appellants' File, Appeal Memorandum, para. 10-53.\n2 RPD-1, Notice of New Issues, dated January 21, 2022.\n3 P-3, Appellant's additional submissions, dated February 4, 2022.\n4 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They fear being seriously harmed or killed by the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (CJNG) if they return to Mexico.\n[2] On XXXX XXXX XXXX2019, the Appellants' brother was kidnapped by the CJNG.1 A ransom demand was sent to the brother's recent telephone contacts, which included the Appellants, their mother, her common-law partner, and their mother's parents (also referred to as the \"grandparents\"). The mother and her common-law partner sought the assistance of the police, but the youngest brother managed to escape through his own efforts. The escape was reported to the police. The ransom was not paid. The brother, mother, and her common-law partner made the decision to stay with the grandparents until they fled to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX2019.2 At the time of the kidnapping, the Appellants were already in Canada, having arrived on XXXX XXXX XXXX2018, and XXXX XXXX XXXX2018, respectively, as visitors.3\n[3] The Appellants' claims were heard jointly with the claims of their mother, brother, and their mother's common-law partner (the \"successful claimants\"), whose claims were allowed under section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Appellants' claims were denied on the basis that they have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Yucatan.\nDECISION\n[4] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The determinative issue is IFA.\nANALYSIS\n[5] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.4\n[6] The RPD found, and the Appellants did not challenge, that the Appellants' allegations, as set out in their mother's Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative, are credible; that their claims are properly assessed under section 97(1) of the IRPA; and that the agent of harm is the CJNG. I agree with these findings.\n[7] The RPD denied the Appellants' claims on the basis that they have a viable IFA in Yucatan. Specifically, the RPD found that the Appellants failed to adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the agent of harm has the motivation to locate and harm them in Yucatan.\n[8] Counsel submits that the RPD erred by failing to consider in its reasons evidence that points to a contrary conclusion, citing the Federal Court decision in Cepeda-Gutierrez.5 Counsel submits that the RPD did not consider (i) the common-law partner's evidence that the cartel asked \"what have your other kids told you because they also saw the video,\"6 and (ii) the Principal Appellant's testimony that he feared they would be targeted to force his mother, her common-law partner, and youngest brother to return to Mexico.7 They submit that the cartel would rely on the closeness a mother has to her sons to convey that they were aware of the Appellants in part to increase the pressure on the parents and in part to indicate that they saw the Appellants as a source of payment.8 Counsel submits that no similar mention was made by the cartel about the grandparents having received the video.9 Counsel also submits that the RPD placed a greater evidentiary hurdle on the Appellants in its assessment of the motivation of the cartel to pursue them in the IFA.10 In particular, it is submitted that the country condition evidence which supports that the cartel would be motivated to pursue the successful claimants due to their perceived \"betrayal\" ought to support a positive determination for the Appellants who also betrayed the cartel by not paying the ransom demand. The Appellants submit that it is an error to differentiate between the risk faced by his mother, who reported the kidnapping to the police, and the risk the Appellants face as a result of not paying the ransom demand.\n[9] Turning to the first argument, Counsel is correct to note that these two pieces of evidence are not explicitly mentioned in the RPD's reasons. However, it is well established that decision-makers are not required to refer to every piece of evidence that they receive that is contrary to their finding and to explain how they dealt with it.11 In my view, the RPD did not err in failing to include consideration of this evidence in its reasons because the evidence does not squarely contradict the RPD's finding of fact that the Appellants were similarly situated to the grandparents in terms of their risk profile. The fact that the agent of harm knew the Appellants to be the \"other children\" does not directly rebut the finding that the Appellants are similarly situated to the grandparents in terms of their risk profile, nor does it have the effect of establishing that the Appellants hold a closer personal relationship with the mother.\n[10] After an independent assessment of these two pieces of evidence, I find that RPD did not err in its assessment of the Appellants' risk profile.\n[11] In my view, the RPD's analysis was correctly focused on the factors that tend to prove and disprove the motivation of the agent of harm, and specifically in this case, whether the Appellants have a profile that puts them at risk. On my independent assessment, I find that the positive risk factors are as follows:\n(a) The Appellants were direct recipients of the ransom demands.12\n(b) The ransom demands were not paid, and country evidence indicates that refusing to pay a debt could motivate a cartel to pursue the person outside of the cartel's area of operation.13\n(c) The Appellants' mother received a subsequent threatening message approximately one year after fleeing Mexico.14\n[12] These positive risk factors are to be balanced against the negative risk factors in the case:\n(a) The Appellants were never directly threatened by the agent of harm.\n(b) The Appellants did not receive any further threats after their youngest brother escaped.\n(c) The Appellants did not receive any further threats, through any means, after their mother and her common-law partner went to the police.15 I note that the threat received by the mother while in Canada was received through her Instagram account, and not via the same phone number she had while she was in Mexico. I also note that, contrary to counsel's submission, I do not have evidence that the Appellants got rid of their phones or changed their phone numbers after receiving the ransom demands in XXXX2019; there is only evidence from both Appellants that they blocked their brother's number from which the cartel was communicating during the course of their brother's kidnapping.16\n(d) The Appellants themselves did not go to the police.\n[13] The RPD also considered the Appellants' argument that their \"close blood relations\" to the successful claimants put them at greater risk than their grandparents.17 The evidence establishes that the grandparents, who also received the ransom demand and who also did not pay, continue to live and work in Mexico without incident. The Appellants rely on country condition evidence which states that those who betray a cartel would be killed,18 and evidence which indicates that gangs may routinely target family members as an act of retaliation or to exert pressure on other members of the family to succumb to recruitment attempts or extortion demands.19 The RPD found that the CJNG would not differentiate between the maternal grandparents or the Appellants if they were motivated to send a message to the successful claimants for not meeting their demands.\n[14] I agree with the RPD. I find that having \"close blood relations\" does not increase the Appellants' particular risk profile in the specific circumstances of this case. In my view, general country condition evidence about risks potentially faced by family members who betray a cartel does not assist the Appellants, because in this case, there is specific evidence about the experience of other family members which suggests the opposite: the grandparents have not received any further threats despite having directly received the ransom demand and despite not having paid.\n[15] I acknowledge that there is no evidence that the cartel was aware of the blood relations of the grandparents and their \"closeness\" to the mother or the brother who was kidnapped. I also acknowledge that, in contrast, the cartel's statement to the common-law partner - \"what have your other kids told you because they also saw the video\" - does, in fact, demonstrate that the cartel was aware of the blood relation of the Appellants. However, this comment cannot be looked at in isolation.\n[16] Determining whether the Appellants face a forward-looking section 97 risk in the IFA requires looking at all of the evidence. The evidence establishes that Appellants have not been threatened in any way beyond the ransom demands made on XXXX XXXX XXXX2019, even though the ransom demands were not met. I decline to give more weight to general country condition evidence which suggests the Appellants may be at risk due to a perceived betrayal when there is specific evidence that speaks to the agent of harm's lack of motivation in this particular case, namely, that the Appellants' lives have never been directly threatened; they have not received any further threats from the cartel after their brother was kidnapped in XXXX2019 or after their mother and her partner went to the police; they have not personally made any police complaint against the cartel, and the threat received by their mother after she was in Canada did not name or otherwise engage the Appellants. In my view, the evidence specific to this case supports a finding that the Appellants have not been targeted for retaliation. I, therefore, agree with the RPD's finding that the Appellants are similarly situated to the grandparents in terms of their risk profile. While the closeness of blood relations may be a factor to consider in analyzing a claimant's risk profile, in this case, it is not a determinative factor when looking at the evidence as a whole. The Appellants have not discharged their burden to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the cartel would be motivated to seek out and harm them if they were to relocate to Yucatan.\n[17] It follows that I agree with the RPD that the Appellants have failed to prove that they would be at risk in Yucatan under the first prong of the IFA test. Even if I were to find that the cartel likely has the means to find the Appellants in Yucatan, which is noted to be the most peaceful state in Mexico,20 they have not discharged their burden to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the cartel has the motivation to do so.\n[18] I note that the Appellants did not challenge the RPD's findings under the second prong, namely, that it would be reasonable in the Appellants' circumstances to move there. I find that the Appellants would be well placed to obtain employment in the IFA, having some high school education and work experiences in both Mexico and Canada. They speak the language of the majority, and there is no evidence of obstacles in obtaining employment, housing, and social services in the IFA. I note, also, that the Appellants travelled to Canada when they were 19 and 20 years old, where they lived without their mother for over a year. I agree with the RPD that it is objectively reasonable, in all of the Appellants' circumstances, for them to relocate to Yucatan.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nRosemary Basa\nRosemary Basa\nMarch 25, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, RPD Reasons, at p. 4, para 3.\n2 Ibid., at p. 4, para 4.\n3 Ibid., at pp. 12-13, para 42.\n4 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He alleges that XXXX was imprisoned for XXXX and that upon his release from prison in XXXX 2018, he threatened the male appellant again.\n[7] The appellants left Lebanon on XXXX XXXX, 2018, for Canada where they claimed refugee protection.\n[8] Following a hearing on January 15, 2021, the RPD rejected the refugee protection claim on the grounds that the appellants have an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Lebanon, in the city of Tripoli.\n[9] Before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), the appellants submit that the RPD erred in its assessment of the IFA for reasons that will be detailed below in the \"Analysis\" section, if necessary.\n[10] For these reasons, the appellants are asking the RAD to set aside the RPD's determination and grant them refugee protection or, alternatively, to refer the matter to the RPD for redetermination.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW AND ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[11] The role of the RAD is to review RPD decisions by applying the correctness standard of review after conducting its own analysis of the record in order to determine whether the RPD erred, as submitted by the appellants.\nANALYSIS\n[12] The issue in this case is whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the IFA for the appellants in Lebanon.\n[13] After analyzing all the evidence presented, including reviewing the transcript of the RPD hearing and the latter's reasons as well as the appellants' memorandum, I consider, for the following reasons, that it did not.\n[14] First, in this case, the RPD writes in its reasons that, with some exceptions, the appellants' allegations are generally credible.\n[15] In its analysis of the IFA, however, the RPD found that the following allegations were not credible:\n* The allegation that XXXX is affiliated or has ties to Hezbollah or Amal militias, as the male appellant testified, since he failed to mention these militias in his BOC Form, in which he only wrote that XXXX has ties to politicians and militias in South Lebanon, without naming them.\n* The allegation that XXXX has a criminal and violent past, since the only evidence to that effect is that he had been convicted in 2009 for XXXX.\n* The allegation that the XXXX refused to take the appellant's complaint in 2018 on the grounds that XXXX was well connected with politicians, since XXXX was allegedly convicted and imprisoned for XXXX.\n[16] In any event, the criteria to apply in assessing IFAs were defined by the Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam1 and Thirunavukkarasu,2 and these cases clearly demonstrate that the test to be applied in determining whether there is an IFA is two-pronged:\ni. ... the Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.\nii. Second, conditions in that part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.\n[17] Both prongs must be established to conclude that an IFA exists.\n[18] For the first prong of the analysis, the RPD determined that an IFA is available for the appellants in the city of Tripoli, located in northern Lebanon, because the evidence presented does not show that XXXX would have the ability to find them in that city, namely by bribing social services where the male appellant, as a XXXX XXXX XXXX, should be registered, as he alleges.\n[19] The RPD also considered that the evidence presented does not demonstrate that XXXX would have the motivation to pursue the appellants in Tripoli, because his dispute with the male appellant dates back to 2009, and the appellants had no issues between 2010 and 2018, and because the male appellant did not testify against XXXX when he was allegedly convicted of XXXX.\n[20] In their memorandum, the appellants first submit that the RPD's conclusion regarding XXXX alleged ties to the Hezbollah militia is erroneous because the male appellant testified that XXXX chased him in a car, in 2018, with individuals displaying Hezbollah-related signs. They also state that the RPD's conclusion that the evidence does not show that XXXX has a criminal history is erroneous since it was the male appellant himself, as a XXXX XXXX, who checked his criminal background.\n[21] It is my view that these RPD conclusions, whether erroneous or not, do not, in any case, affect the RPD's conclusion with respect to the IFA.\n[22] While the evidence presented may suggest that XXXX has ties to Hezbollah, particularly in that he allegedly displayed signs of that militia in 2018, the evidence nonetheless demonstrates that these ties do not make XXXX untouchable or powerful, since he was reportedly convicted and imprisoned despite these alleged ties. Which is why, like the RPD, I find that it is not credible that the police refused to register the male appellant's complaint in 2018.\n[23] As for XXXX criminal past-which the male appellant alleges he noted in 2009-I first note that the male appellant's testimony is imprecise in that he was unable to specify what crimes XXXX allegedly committed in the past, which can only undermine the credibility of this allegation. And in any case, as stated above, I am of the opinion that this detail does not affect the issue of the IFA for the appellants.\n[24] After analyzing all the evidence presented, I am of the opinion that it does not demonstrate that XXXX would have the motivation to pursue the appellants in the city of Tripoli.\n[25] While XXXX might want to threaten the male appellant in the city of XXXX, where apparently both live, I do not see why he would do so in the city of Tripoli, located some XXXX kilometres from XXXX.\n[26] The appellants had no problems with XXXX between 2010 and 2018 when they were still living in XXXX. Even though XXXX was imprisoned during this period, it would appear that he never called on his [translation] \"contacts\" in militias or criminal organizations to attack the appellants, which, in my opinion, already demonstrates a lack of motivation on XXXX part.\n[27] In their memorandum, the appellants submit that it is XXXX ties to militias and his criminal past that would motivate him to pursue them in Tripoli, because he holds the male appellant responsible for his imprisonment and financial losses.\n[28] I note that this is not what the evidence presented shows, on a balance of probabilities. The male appellant testified that he did not know for which XXXX XXXX had been convicted. Nothing in the evidence provided demonstrates that XXXX conviction was related to the case in which the male appellant had been allegedly involved in 2009.\n[29] While I do not consider that the appellants should have to explain the actions of others, it seems implausible to me, to say the least, that XXXX would consider the male appellant to be responsible for his misfortunes. Several other people were likely much more involved in XXXX conviction than the male appellant, including police officers, prosecutors and witnesses. And XXXX financial losses are likely the result of his imprisonment, which, according to the male appellant, lasted several years, much more than his actions in 2009.\n[30] Also, the appellants have several family members who still live in the city of XXXX, and nothing in the evidence presented shows that they were questioned, harassed or threatened by XXXX, who is allegedly looking for the appellants. In my opinion, this is an additional element that demonstrates XXXX lack of motivation to find the appellants, let alone find them in a remote city like Tripoli.\n[31] Moreover, the city of Tripoli, located in the north of Lebanon, is not under the influence of the militias and politicians of southern Lebanon, dominated by the Lebanese Shia Muslims. It is entirely reasonable to believe that XXXX would have no influence in Tripoli, which is another reason for the determination that he would not have the ability or motivation to find the appellants in that city.\n[32] As a result of the foregoing, I come to the same conclusion as the RPD, namely, that there is neither a serious possibility that the appellants would be persecuted nor a probability that they would be subjected to a danger of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to settle in Tripoli.\n[33] As for the second prong of the IFA analysis, namely, the reasonableness of the IFA, the RPD concluded that nothing in the evidence provided demonstrates that it would be objectively unreasonable for the appellants to settle in Tripoli.\n[34] The RPD was of the opinion that the appellants have not demonstrated that they would not be able to work in Tripoli, the second most populous city in Lebanon, given their work experience and education.\n[35] In their memorandum, the appellants submit that the RPD failed to consider the religious factor in its assessment, and refer to the documentary evidence contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Lebanon (document included in the most recent package, dated September 29, 2021), at Tab 12.2.3\n[36] I have reviewed this document and I am of the opinion that the information contained in it does not demonstrate that the IFA for the appellants in Tripoli would be unreasonable. It states that Christians in Lebanon are not subject to targeted violence because of their religious affiliation, and although there may have been incidents in Tripoli, these would be rather due to the professional activities of the individuals targeted.\n[37] In fact, the documentary evidence indicates that in Lebanon, relations between religious communities are usually friendly (see tabs 1.34 and 12.15 of the NDP on Lebanon of September 29, 2021, in particular).\n[38] Political instability and economic problems in Lebanon, while they may make settlement in Tripoli more difficult, do not make it unreasonable.\n[39] Considering the appellants' personal characteristics, including their work experience, nothing suggests that they would be unable to find employment and housing there. There is also no evidence that the minor appellants and the female appellant, XXXX, if she so desires, would not be able to study in Tripoli.\n[40] Consequently, in light of the foregoing, I conclude that the appellants did not demonstrate that the RPD committed errors that would justify the RAD's intervention.\nREMEDY\n[41] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD determination that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are neither \"Convention refugees\" pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) nor \"persons in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[42] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nMarch 29, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Rasaratnam v.

He is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) that he is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the PA is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The PA alleges that his father had a dispute with his brother (the PA's uncle) regarding agricultural land. The PA's Basis of Claim (BOC) reports that this dispute worsened to the point that the PA's uncle and cousins attacked the PA's house and family. The PA and his brother were subsequently threatened with death, and the PA's parents then sent him to another city in India and eventually to Canada because of these threats.\n[4] In XXXX 2019, the PA's father was attacked in India. After this attack, the PA made plans to return to India to assist his father; however, his father dissuaded him from returning. The PA reports that he was attacked in XXXX 2019 in Canada in an incident which he presumes is related to his father's land dispute. The PA also fears returning to India because he has protested the Indian government while in Canada.\n[5] The RPD found that the PA's evidence lacked credibility because of several inconsistencies in his evidence. The PA argues that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment. However, I agree with the RPD that credibility is the determinative issue in this case.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The PA wishes to enter an affidavit into the appeal record.\nThe evidence presented by the Appellant is accepted\n[7] According to the law, I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the Appellant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision. 1\n[8] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.2\n[9] I find that the PA's affidavit was created after the RPD decision and deals directly with credibility findings of the RPD. As such, I find that the PA could not have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before its decision. Moreover, I find that this evidence is new given that it deals directly with the RPD's credibility findings, and relevant because it seeks to provide some context for the RPD's credibility findings. Finally, I find that the affidavit is credible since there is no reason-on the face of the document-to doubt its credibility. For these reasons, I find that the PA's affidavit is accepted into the appeal record.\nOral hearing\n[10] Given that I have admitted new evidence on appeal, I must consider whether an oral hearing is necessary under s. 110(6) of IRPA. Having reviewed the new evidence and the record, I find that an oral hearing is not required in this appeal because the new evidence does not raise a serious issue about the PA's credibility that is central to the decision and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim.\nANALYSIS\n[11] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.3 I find that the RPD was correct in determining that the PA's allegations lack credibility.\nCredibility\n[12] Sworn evidence is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness.4 Reasons to doubt the credibility of sworn evidence include inconsistencies and omissions. Furthermore, even if they may be insufficient when considered in isolation, the accumulation of contradictions, inconsistencies, and omissions regarding crucial elements of a refugee claim can support a negative conclusion about an applicant's credibility.5 For the reasons that follow, I find that this is an instance where the accumulation of significant inconsistencies in the PA's evidence results in a negative conclusion about his credibility.\nRPD's findings\n[13] The RPD found that the PA's BOC and testimony were inconsistent as to whether his family and\/or home were attacked while he was in India. The PA's BOC indicated that his family and home were attacked while he was still in India. However, the PA testified that his uncle and cousins had never attacked his home and family while he was there. The RPD put this to the PA and found that he did not explain the contradiction. Rather, when this contradiction was put to him, the PA stated that there were small skirmishes and his father was pushed around, but no one was ever injured. The PA then testified that his father and family had not been attacked while he was in India, but that this occurred after he came to Canada. The RPD found that the PA failed to provide an explanation for the inconsistent evidence about when his family was attacked. Similarly, the RPD noted that the PA's BOC said that his home was attacked while he was in India but that in his testimony, he \"admitted that the house was never attacked by anyone, including the claimant's uncles and sons.\" The PA did not explain this contradiction.\n[14] The RPD also noted that the PA's BOC and testimony were inconsistent as to whether he was aware that his life had been threatened prior to him leaving India. It noted that the PA's BOC stated that his life had been threatened which was why he was sent to Canada. However, the RPD noted that the PA testified several times that he did not know of the threat to his life until after he came to Canada. Furthermore, the RPD noted that the PA did not provide an explanation for the material contradiction between his testimony and his BOC narrative on this point.\nAppellant's arguments\n[15] The PA argues that the inconsistencies between his BOC and testimony occurred because much of the information about the land dispute in India was provided to the PA by his father after he already filed his BOC. As such, he argues that the resulting inconsistencies and contradictions between the PA's BOC and testimony were because of the additional details he received from his father after submitting his BOC. The PA also argues that he was young when the central persecutory events occurred, and his memory of these events is not perfect. Furthermore, the PA argues that he is unsophisticated, and during the hearing he became confused, disoriented, and anxious and was unable to answer the RPD's questions comprehensively.\nMy findings\n[16] I find that there are significant credibility issues with the PA's evidence. I note that the PA does not deny that he provided inconsistent evidence on significant issues, including whether his family and\/or home were ever attacked while he was in India, and whether he was aware that his life had been threatened prior to leaving India. Furthermore, I note that the PA did not provide explanations for these contradictions or inconsistencies before the RPD.\n[17] The PA explains on appeal that any such inconsistencies between his BOC and his testimony occurred because he received additional details from his father after submitting his BOC. However, this does not explain the significant discrepancies at issue. Indeed, the PA stated in his BOC that his home and family were both attacked-and his life was threatened-while he was in India which is why he came to Canada. However, his testimony before the RPD provides contradictory information-that his father and home were only attacked after he left India, and that he was not aware of the threat to his life until he came to Canada. I find that these significant contradictions are not reasonably explained by the PA receiving new information from his father-indeed, it would make little sense that the PA only came to realize after coming to Canada and getting additional information from his father that the attacks and threats he reported in his BOC did not occur in India while he was there as alleged.\n[18] Furthermore, I do not find that the PA's age reasonably explains why he reported these events occurred while he was in India in his BOC but not in his testimony. Indeed, I note that the PA has still not provided an explanation as to why his BOC is very clear about an attack having occurred on his family and his home while he was in India, but that his testimony denied that such an attack occurred against his family and home while he was in India. Similarly, the PA has not reasonably explained why his BOC states that he fled to Canada after being the subject of death threats, but he then testified that he was unaware of these threats until after he came to Canada. Moreover, while the PA also explains that these inconsistencies are a result of his confusion and anxiety during the RPD hearing, I note that there is no medical evidence before me to suggest that the PA has any mental health issues that may have affected his testimony before the RPD.\n[19] Rather, I find that the PA has not reasonably explained the significant contradictions in his evidence about whether his family and\/or home were attacked while he was in India, and whether he had knowledge of the death threat against him at the time he came to Canada. As such, I draw a significant negative credibility inference regarding the PA's allegations on this basis.\nCorroborating evidence\nRPD's findings\n[20] The RPD also considered the supporting evidence put forward by the PA. The RPD found that the evidence about his father being attacked in India proved that this attack had occurred, but noted that it did not serve to corroborate the PA's own allegations of risk. The RPD noted that the First Information Report (FIR) regarding the PA's father's attack indicated that the PA's father was assaulted in XXXX 2019, but it did not provide any context for the attack and did not corroborate the PA's allegations of his own risk. Indeed, the RPD noted that the FIR did not mention that the attack had anything to do with the land dispute in question, or that it occurred on the order of the PA's uncle as alleged. The RPD also considered the letter from the PA's father, but noted that it did not state that the men who attacked him threatened his son's life. The RPD found it not credible that the father's letter did not reference threats against the PA's life that were allegedly made during the XXXX 2019 attack. The RPD also found that this letter was inconsistent with the PA's own evidence about the attack on the PA's house and family.\nAppellant's arguments\n[21] The PA argues that his testimony and the corroborating evidence supports his claim, despite the inconsistencies in his testimony at the RPD hearing.\nMy findings\n[22] I note that the PA did not make any arguments about the RPD's findings that the FIR did not provide any context for the attack on his father and did not corroborate his narrative. Nor did the PA provide any additional arguments about the RPD's finding that the PA's father's letter failed to reference threats against the PA's life, nor the inconsistency between the letter and the PA's evidence about the alleged attack on the PA's family and home. I see no reason to intervene with the RPD's unchallenged findings on this point. Based on these unchallenged findings, I find that this evidence deserves no weight in proving the PA's allegations.\nAttack in Canada\nRPD's findings\n[23] The RPD also found that there was no definitive connection between the attack on the PA in Canada and his family's issues in India. The RPD noted that the PA could only speculate that the events were connected as the assailants in Canada did not give any reasons for the attack.\nAppellant's arguments\n[24] The PA argues that the RPD erred in finding that the attack he faced in Canada was not orchestrated by his uncle and the renter of the disputed land as alleged.\nMy findings\n[25] I find that there is insufficient evidence before me linking the attack the PA experienced in Canada to the alleged threat he faces in India. Indeed, while the PA speculated in his testimony that the attack had to do with his family's ongoing property dispute in India, I find that this is simply speculative and that a connection between the two has not been proven on a balance of probabilities. Indeed, the PA testified that he had no idea why he was attacked, and he was assuming it was orchestrated by his uncle and cousins. While I acknowledge the PA's testimony that he was threatened against returning to India during this attack, I do not find that this is sufficient evidence to link the attack faced by the PA in Canada to his family's land dispute in India. Rather, I find that there is insufficient evidence in this instance to find that the attack the PA experienced in Canada is related to the alleged threat facing him in India.\nCredibility summary\n[26] I find that the PA has failed to reasonably explain the significant discrepancies between his BOC and his testimony about his allegations, and I find that this is an instance where the accumulation of significant inconsistencies in the PA's evidence results in a negative conclusion about his credibility. Moreover, while I have considered the documentary evidence provided by the PA to corroborate his claim, I do not find that this evidence is sufficient to offset the significant credibility concerns regarding the PA's claim noted above, especially given the additional credibility concerns related to the PA's father letter which were unchallenged by the PA on appeal. Rather, based on these inconsistencies, I find that the PA has failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he was ever threatened in India because of a land dispute as alleged. As such, I do not find that the PA has shown that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk of torture, a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returns to India as alleged.\nParticipation in Canadian protests\n[27] In his updated BOC, the PA also provided evidence about attending two protests while Canada in support of farmers' protests in India. He is alleging that he faces a serious possibility of persecution on this basis upon his return to India.\nRPD's findings\n[28] The RPD considered the PA's attendance at protests against the Indian government in Canada; however, it found that the PA did not have a sufficient profile to warrant his being targeted by the government upon his return to India. Furthermore, the RPD also noted that the PA never attended protests in India, nor did he indicate that he would in the future.\nAppellant's arguments\n[29] While he has no plan to protest in India, the PA alleges that he is nevertheless afraid that his name or his picture may have been passed to the government of India by the people targeting his family, which may have resulted in him being placed on the government's wanted list. The PA notes that Punjabi Sikhs have been on the forefront of the farmers' protests and are being targeted by the police as a result. Furthermore, the PA notes that they are being detained upon entry into the country, as per the article he put into evidence. The PA argues that the RPD failed to consider this article when making its decision.\nMy findings\n[30] I am mindful of the PA's concern that his name and\/or his picture may have been given to the government of India by those who wish to target his family and that this may have resulted in him being placed on the government's wanted list. However, I note that the PA's concerns in this instance are once again speculative given that the PA has not provided any evidence to demonstrate that his attendance at these protests has been noted by his uncle or cousins, or that this information was subsequently given to the government. As such, I do not find he faces a serious possibility of persecution on this basis.\n[31] Moreover, I note that the documentary evidence suggests that many there are hundreds of thousands of farmers who have been protesting in India, and that most of the protests have been peaceful. I do note that the evidence speaks to the government arresting some high-profile people involved with these protests in India, including the media and protest organizers. However, the PA has not provided any evidence that he has an increased profile-such as that of a journalist, a protest organizer, a farmers' union leader, a prominent social activist, or a member of Sikhs for Justice-such that he would be at risk of attracting the government's attention on this basis.6\n[32] Furthermore, while the PA alleges that the RPD failed to consider the article he submitted into evidence about a person supporting the farmers' protest not being able to enter India, I note that the person about whom the article was written is reported to be an \"Indian-American billionaire ... who had been helping the cause of farmers\" and who has been \"running a langar at Singhu\" over a long period of time. 7 I note that this description suggests that the person in the article provided by the PA could reasonably be described as a prominent Sikh and\/or a social activist, which I find suggests that he has an increased profile. I find that this distinguishes him from the PA who has not demonstrated such a profile.\n[33] Having considered the evidence before me, I do not find that the PA has demonstrated that he faces a serious possibility of persecution or a s. 97 risk in India because of his attendance at political protests in Canada.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the PA is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAlison Kennedy\nAlison Kennedy\nMay 11, 2022\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, subsection 110(4).\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

You have stated that you fear persecution from your family and community by reason of your conversion to the Hindu religion.1\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) determined that you had an internal flight alternative (IFA) by relocating to Bengaluru or Indore.2\n[3] On appeal, you submitted that the RPD breached your right to procedural fairness by failing to explain, as it should have, your burden with respect to an IFA, and that it erred in concluding that you had such an IFA.3\n[4] After analyzing your record, I conclude that the RPD did not err as you allege. Your appeal is therefore dismissed.\nANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\n[5] The role of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.4 The RAD is entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the RPD when the RPD was wrong.5 Except in the circumstances described in subsection 111(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD makes the final call, subject to a judicial review, as it is intended to promote finality in the refugee protection claims process.6\n[6] I have conducted an analysis of your record7 and responded to the central issues raised by your appeal,8 particularly by reading the transcript of the RPD hearing9 and the documentary evidence. I also applied the principle of responsive justification. In other words, I have ensured that my decision is justified in light of the facts and the law and takes into account the consequences that may impact your life, liberty and dignity.10 I conclude that the correctness standard of review must be applied to the RPD's decision.11\nA. The errors you allege the Refugee Protection Division made\n[7] The RAD Rules set out that you must specify: (i) the errors that are the grounds of the appeal, and (ii) where the errors are located in the RPD's decision or in the transcript or in any recording of the hearing.12\n[8] In your memorandum, you submit that the RPD breached your right to procedural fairness by failing to explain, as it should have, your burden with respect to an IFA and that it erred in concluding that you had such an IFA.13\n[9] With respect to procedural fairness, your arguments are summarized as follows.\n[10] Since no consultant or lawyer represented you before the RPD, the RPD had a greater obligation to explain to you the issues to be addressed and what you needed to establish for your refugee protection claim to be allowed. The test to be applied in determining whether there is an IFA is highly technical and has two prongs. Although the RPD raised the issue of an IFA, in either Bengaluru or Indore, it did not adequately explain what the test in question is, which resulted in you failing to understand what burden of proof was required in the circumstances.14\n[11] With respect to the errors made by the RPD in its analysis of the IFA, your arguments are summarized as follows.\n[12] The RPD concluded that there was no evidence that anyone would be able to find you in Bengaluru or in Indore, yet during your testimony you stated that your cousin had been able to find you in Canada and had caused you to lose your job. Furthermore, even though your cousins had not found you when you lived in Kolkota, they had kept looking for you and asking your brother and your mother for information to find you anyway.\n[13] Furthermore, even if you were not physically assaulted while living there, you were nevertheless threatened and prevented from working by the Sikh community. This testimony is not at all speculative. As for the RPD's statement that you did not testify that you had lived in hiding in Kolkota, it is inappropriate and indicates that the RPD expected you to behave in an unreasonable manner, given that you did not have to live in hiding or hide your religion. If there was any ambiguity in your answers, the RPD had to clarify it all.\n[14] In short, the RPD's conclusion is based on a misapprehension of your testimony about the identity of your agents of persecution and their motivation in targeting you, including while you were in Canada.15\nB. Refugee Protection Division's decision\n[15] The RPD summarized your allegations in its decision.16 It stated that the determinative issue was that you had an IFA by going to relocate in Bengaluru or Indore. It also stated that it was analyzing your refugee protection claim under section 96 of the IRPA; your fear of persecution was related to your religion.17\n[16] I am of the opinion that it is useful here to reproduce the paragraphs of its decision, which contain the main aspects of its reasoning with respect to the first prong of the IFA analysis:\n7. When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary. However, this presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation for which there is no evidentiary basis. I have found the claimant to be a genuine and credible witness with regards to the circumstances surrounding his religious conversion, and the various attacks against him in his home village. However, I find the claimant to be speculative with regards to the agents of persecution and their means and motivation in pursuing him outside of his home village. It is the uncertainty with regards to the agents of persecution that has led to my ultimate finding with regards to IFA which I will address later in this decision....\n18. The agents of persecution in this case are the claimant's cousins and the local community in his village, including the police. The claimant alleges that he will not be safe in any other part of India because the Sikh community is everywhere and that once they are determined to ruin someone, they will pursue them. As an example, the claimant cited how his cousin was able to have him fired from his job in Canada. However, upon further questioning, the claimant stated that he does not know that the agents of harm would be interested in him, and that it is quite possible that they would have forgotten about him. He states that if this were the case, their interest would be renewed if they saw him, however he was unable to say why or how the agents of harm would know he was in Bengaluru or Indore.\n19. There is no evidence that the agents of persecution would have the means or motivation to track the claimant to either of the proposed IFA locations. Bengaluru is a large city with a population between 8.5 and 11.5 million. Indore is the largest city in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The agents of persecution did not find the claimant when he was living with his aunt in Kolkata. While the claimant testified that individuals from his village were asking about him and he was worried that they would find him, no one ever came to look for him while he lived there for two months. The claimant did not testify that he was living in hiding while he was in Kolkata, stating that he would go out with the whole family when they were there. Considering that the claimant was living with family at the time and some of the agents of persecution were his cousins, it would not have been difficult for them to locate and harm the claimant had they wished to do so.\n20. The clamant [sic] provided no evidence as to how someone would be able to find him in either of the proposed IFAs. His comments that the Sikh community is everywhere, the whole community is there and would find him are vague and speculative. While the claimant cites as an example his belief that his cousin was able to have him fired because he was friends [sic] with the owner he worked for in Canada, he was unable to provide any evidence that this was more than a coincidence. Further, if his cousin in Canada were [sic] able to get him fired from his job, he would have known where the claimant was located and had the opportunity to pursue him in Canada. This did not occur; the claimant has testified that he is not in contact with any of his cousins in Canada.18\n[17] The RPD continued a broader analysis of the possibility of your persecution in both of the cities identified as IFAs because of your religious conversion or the allegations that you eat beef. After analyzing the documentary evidence and your testimony about your experiences while living in Kolkata, the RPD concluded that you would not be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution by relocating there.19\n[18] As for the second prong of the IFA, after analyzing your testimony as well as the documentary evidence, the RPD concluded that, given your personal characteristics, it was not unreasonable for you to relocate to either Bengaluru or Indore.20\nC. The Refugee Protection Division did not err as you allege\n[19] After conducting my own analysis of your record, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err as you allege. Before analyzing the issue of the IFA, I will consider whether the RPD complied with the principles of procedural fairness.\nThe Refugee Protection Division complied with procedural fairness\n[20] A refugee protection claimant is free to represent themself or to use the services of an immigration consultant or lawyer. A hearing before the RPD is fair if the refugee protection claimant understands the nature of the proceeding, is prepared to represent themself, and is able to participate meaningfully in the hearing, which means that the claimant has whatever leeway is reasonably possible to allow them to present their case in its entirety.21 When a person represents themself, the RPD must encourage them to state what they fear and present evidence of that fear, explain the process and clarify the nature of the decision being made. The consequences of the decision and the complexity of the matter can have an impact in determining whether a hearing is fair.22\n[21] After carefully reading the transcript of your hearing, I conclude that you were given the right to a fair hearing. The reasons are as follows.\n[22] While the consequences of the RPD's decision are obviously significant to you, I am of the opinion that at the time of the hearing you were prepared to proceed without representation, you understood the nature of the questions and the principles involved in the decision as to whether your claim should be allowed or rejected.\n[23] At the outset of the hearing, the RPD referred to the documents included in your record. It asked if you had any concerns in this regard. You answered no.23\n[24] The RPD then asked if the information included in your Basis of Claim Form was complete, true and correct.24 You confirmed that it was. In response to question 9 of this form, you answered that you did not have a consultant; for instance, a lawyer, an immigration consultant, a family member or other person who could help you with your refugee protection claim.25\n[25] The RPD also identified the three issues to be analyzed during the hearing, namely, your credibility, state protection and IFA. It then explained that this last issue was whether there was a safe place for you to live in India and whether it was reasonable for you to live there. It then identified two locations: Bengaluru and Indore.\n[26] The RPD then explained how the hearing would proceed. It indicated that if you needed a break at any time, you should say so and that it was possible to take one. It asked if you had any questions before it started its own questioning. You answered no.26\n[27] During the hearing, the RPD asked you questions regarding the possibility for you to live safely in Bengaluru. You replied that the entire Sikh community is there, and that you did not think you would be safe. The RPD also asked you why you thought the Sikh community in Bengaluru would show interest in you. You replied that you could not be sure because you had not lived there for quite some time. You also stated that you know that the Sikh community could ruin someone if they had a mind to, and that if you were somewhere and someone found you, they would certainly cause you harm. The RPD asked you how they would be able to find you. You replied that you had not told anyone where you were except your sister and that they had found you. You added that when they have a reason to find someone, they will find them. The RPD asked why they had decided to find you. You replied that you did not know whether they had decided to find you, that it was possible that they had forgotten, but that if someone were to see you, they would recall to their mind what you look like and realize that you were the one that they had beaten and the one they had to kill. Lastly, the RPD asked if you would be able to live in Bengaluru, if no one was looking for you there. You replied that if they wanted to find you, they would, but if you had to live there or anywhere else, nothing would stop you from doing so.27\n[28] Afterwards, the RPD asked if you would be able to live safely in Indore. You answered that you did not know anything about Indore. The RPD then asked if you thought the people you feared would be able to find you in Indore. You replied that you did not know. However, you added that you knew that if they were to find out where you were, they would approach you. Lastly, the RPD finally asked how they would be able to know that you are in Indore, if they themselves were not there. You replied that no one knew you were in Canada, but it so happened that the person you worked with was your cousin's friend.28\n[29] At that point in the hearing, the RPD indicated that it had no further questions for you. It asked if you wanted to discuss the issues you considered important and were not asked about. The RPD also invited you to present your arguments; in other words, why it should allow your refugee protection claim. You replied that you felt safe in Canada, but that in India, the government has no power over any of the things people want to do, so one does not feel safe there. You also stated that you had reported everything and had nothing more to add. The RPD then stated that it could not render a decision right away, that it would take the time to review all the evidence and analyze your claim and that it would prepare a written decision that would be mailed to you. It then asked you if you had any other questions. You answered no.29\n[30] In light of the case law, I am of the opinion that the RPD's actions complied with procedural fairness. In other words, it encouraged you to state what you feared in India, to present your testimony and your arguments. It used simple terms to address the issue of whether you could live safely in the two cities identified as IFAs. It also asked you to indicate whether it would be reasonable for you to relocate there. In its decision, the RPD explained to you why it concluded that you had an IFA in either Bengaluru or Indore. Therefore, I see no breach of the principles of a fair hearing for a person representing themself.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in its analysis of the internal flight alternative\n[31] To determine whether an IFA exists, the RPD or the RAD must be satisfied that the refugee protection claimant would not be subjected to a risk of persecution or to a risk to life in that part of the country and that the situation in that part of the country is such that it would not be unreasonable for the refugee protection claimant to seek refuge there. The existence of an IFA is a determinative factor. The onus is on the refugee protection claimant to prove that they are at risk of being persecuted or subjected to a risk to their life in the part of the country identified as an IFA, or that it would be unreasonable for them to relocate in that part of their country.30\n[32] At paragraphs 27, 28, and 29 of this decision, I have identified the exchanges between the RPD and you regarding an IFA in your country. In conducting my own analysis of your record, I have also considered the decision of my colleague, Julie Corry, which has been identified as constituting reasons of interest regarding an IFA in India.31 Overall, I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that you had an IFA in either Bengaluru or Indore. In other words, and I state this with all due respect, your argument that the RPD's conclusion is based on a misapprehension of your testimony about the identity of your agents of persecution and their motivation to target you is unfounded. The reasons are as follows.\n[33] With respect to the first prong of the IFA analysis, contrary to your argument, it is clear to me that the RPD understood your testimony. The testimony remained vague, speculative and contradictory as to the means and the willingness of people from your village to find you and go after you in Bengaluru or Indore. I am therefore of the view that you have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the people around you, living in your village, would have the means or the willingness to find you in either Bengaluru or Indore or hunt you down for betraying them by converting to Hinduism. I am also of the opinion that you have not established, again on a balance of probabilities, that members of the Sikh community living in either of these cities would have the means or the willingness to come after you because you converted to Hinduism. Your testimony was also very vague in this regard.\n[34] With respect to the second prong of the IFA, the hardship associated with dislocation and relocation is not the kind of undue hardship that makes an IFA unreasonable. The standard is high and requires evidence demonstrating the existence of conditions that would jeopardize your life and safety in travelling to and living there.32 Based on my own analysis of your record, you have not presented any such evidence.\n[35] From your own testimony, it is clear that you have not established that it would be unreasonable for you to relocate in Bengaluru or Indore, if you were to return to India. What is certain is that the RPD considered your personal situation in its decision. Based on my own analysis of your record, it did not err in its analysis of the second prong of the IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] For these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely, that you failed to establish that you have a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA or that, on a balance of probabilities, you would be subjected to a risk within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA if you were to return to live in India and relocate to Bengaluru or Indore.\n[37] Your appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nAlain Bissonnette\nAlain Bissonnette\nMay 26, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Your Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) is reproduced at pages 14 to 23, and the consolidated list of documents is reproduced at page 24 of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) record.\n2 RPD reasons and decision, January 10, 2022, pages 3 to 13 of the RPD record.\n3 Your memorandum, pages 19 to 30 of your appeal record.\n4 Dahal v.

This rejection was confirmed by the RAD on February 16, 2021. The Minister had requested that the ID suspend consideration of the appellant's refugee protection claim because he had participated in activities with a criminal clan pursuant to paragraph 37(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[13] The ID refused the Minister. The Minister appealed to the IAD, which confirmed the ID's decision.\n[14] The Minister was forced to intervene again before the RPD, arguing that the appellant should be excluded from the Convention for having committed serious non-political crimes before arriving in Canada.\nMinister's intervention before the Refugee Appeal Division\n[15] On May 13, 2022, the Minister submitted a Respondent Minister's Intervention Record consisting of a nine-page factum and annexes relating to the file.\n[16] In response to the appellant's memorandum, signed April 4, 2022, the Minister submitted that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the RPD had erred and presented his arguments to that effect.\n[17] The Minister asks that the RAD confirm the RPD's determination.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[18] The RAD reviews RPD decisions, applying the correctness standard of review after conducting its own analysis of the record. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage with respect to the credibility assessment.3 That said, the RAD's role is to determine whether, as argued by the appellant, the RPD did indeed err.\n[19] The RAD applied the correctness standard in this case.\nANALYSIS\n[20] The RPD concluded that there are serious reasons to consider that the provisions of Article 1F(b) of the Convention apply in this case, that is, that there are serious reasons to believe that the claimant committed a serious non-political crime before entering Canada. Consequently, he is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 98 of the IRPA.4\n[21] In reaching this conclusion, the RPD analyzed each of the aspects proposed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Jayasekara.\n[22] The appellant is not specifically challenging the RPD's various conclusions nor responding to submissions and arguments presented by the Minister to the RAD. He focuses his memorandum exclusively on the allegation that the RPD violated the principle of judicial comity in not following the findings of the IAD and the ID.\nFailure to take into consideration the Immigration Appeal Division's decision, which upheld the Immigration Division's decision that the appellant was not inadmissible to Canada by reason of his membership in a criminal organization.\n[23] The appellant submits that the RPD erred in not taking into consideration the decision of the IAD, which upheld the ID's decision that he was not inadmissible to Canada by reason of his membership in a criminal organization.5\n[24] The appellant added that following the IAD's decision, the Minister, who did not apply for judicial review, intervened before the RPD by requesting that he be excluded on the ground of non-political crimes before arriving in Canada.6\n[25] The appellant criticizes the RPD for not following the IAD's decision, thereby violating the principle of judicial comity.\n[26] The Minister submits that the RPD did not disregard the proceedings or hearings held before the ID or IAD because the RPD made reference to them in paragraphs 49 and 50 of its decision;7 that the same Minister's counsel participated in the hearings before the ID, the IAD and the RPD; and that the Minister's submissions\/responses to the RPD (dated December 14, 2021) included8 the following:\n(a) The various issues related to the appellant's criminality were decided by the RPD, the ID and the IAD;\n(b) The appellant's testimony regarding his involvement with organized crime in the United Kingdom was not the same before the RPD and the ID.\n[27] Therefore, judicial comity does not apply, according to the Minister, to the decisions of the RPD, ID and IAD regarding the appellant's involvement with organized crime because the RPD, ID and IAD decided different issues and the appellant's testimony was inconsistent between the ID and RPD hearings.9\n[28] The Minister explained that the correctness standard applies for questions of law and questions of mixed law and fact:\n- The RPD is not bound by the ID decision.\n- The RPD correctly explained in paragraph 50 of its decision that it made findings of fact that were distinct from those made by the IAD.\n- In paragraph 10 of his memorandum, the appellant distorts the issue and the conclusions of the ID and IAD in writing the following: \"Immigration Appeal Division Member Kingma, who upheld a decision of the Immigration Division finding that XXXX XXXX XXXX was not inadmissible to Canada due to his membership in a criminal organization.\" The Minister never alleged to the ID, IAD or RPD that the appellant was a member of a criminal organization. The Minister's submissions to the RPD included the following: \"The Minister compelled XXXX XXXX XXXX to Admissibility Hearing, as it is believed that his criminal activity forms part of a pattern of crimes that were perpetrated by the Clan.\"\n[29] The Minister submits that the questions related to the appellant's participation in drug trafficking in the United Kingdom must be decided pursuant to section 98 of the IRPA and Article 1F(b), which is different from the questions on inadmissibility for organized criminality pursuant to paragraph 37(1)(a) of the IRPA. Under Article 1F(b), exclusion for criminality requires only a relatively simple factual scenario, as opposed to the rather convoluted factors required under paragraph 37(1)(a).10\n[30] Finally, the Minister cites Almrei,11 which lists in paragraph 62 the exceptions to the principle of judicial comity, under which this case falls:\n1. The existence of a different factual matrix or evidentiary basis between the two cases;\n2. Where the issue to be decided is different;\n3. Where the previous condition failed to consider legislation or binding authorities that would have produced a different result, i.e., was manifestly wrong; and\n4. The decision it followed would create an injustice.\n[31] The RAD is of the opinion that the RPD properly analyzed all factors to consider in its assessment of the exclusion under Article 1F(b), the range of sentences under Canadian criminal law with the evidence presented before it by the parties, and the Jayasekara factors as presented by the parties.\n[32] In addition, the appellant's testimony at the hearing before the RPD reveals an awareness of his involvement in significant drug trafficking crimes-an involvement which repeated between 60 and 80 times, and in which the appellant was directly contacted and paid in cash by the criminals.\n[33] The appellant bears the onus of providing full and detailed submissions regarding the errors he alleges were made by the RPD. Rule 3(3)(g) of the RAD specifically requires that the appellant's record include the following:\na memorandum that includes full and detailed submissions regarding\n(i) the errors that are the grounds of the appeal\n(ii) where the errors are located in the written reasons for the Refugee Protection Division's decision that the appellant is appealing or in the transcript or in any audio or other electronic recording of the Refugee Protection Division hearing\n[34] The appellant did not do so. Rather, the appellant made submissions that dealt only with the issue of judicial comity and not with the RPD's analysis of the evidence before it regarding exclusion. It is not for the RAD to speculate on the RPD's errors and\/or to undertake a microscopic search for errors. Moreover, the role of the RAD is not to give the appellant a [translation] \"second chance\" to file a claim.\n[35] The RAD, like the RPD and the Minister, is of the view that sections 37(1)(a) and 98 of the IRPA and Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention are different in scope despite being part of the same Act. Therefore, the RPD did not violate the principle of judicial comity.\n[36] The legal issue to be determined is not the same. For 37(1)(a), the ID and the IAD had to determine whether the appellant was inadmissible by reason of his membership in an organization which-there were reasonable grounds to believe-engaged in criminal activity for the purpose of committing a criminal offence outside Canada that would also constitute an offence in Canada. However, under Article 1F(b) of the Convention, the issue to be determined was whether he committed a serious non-political crime outside the host country.\n[37] The RAD is not bound by the previous decisions of the other divisions and is free to decide the case before it on the basis of the evidence presented to it. In addition, the RPD made appropriate distinctions regarding the evidence before it.\n[38] The RAD is of the view that the main purpose of Article 1F(b) of the Convention is to ensure that those who commit serious non-political crimes prior to their arrival cannot obtain Canada's protection.\n[39] The Minister has the burden of proving that a refugee protection claimant is excluded under Article 1F(b) of the Convention and section 98 of the IRPA; the Minister filed evidence in this case, both with the RPD and the RAD, and established that there are serious reasons to consider that the appellant committed serious non-political crimes.\n[40] The RPD was also clear in its explanation of the differences between the scopes of paragraph 37(1)(a) and Article 1F(b) by referring to Okolo12 in paragraph 28:\nThe test for serious reasons to consider is lower than the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that would apply in a criminal proceeding and is lower than the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities that would apply in a civil proceeding. However, the standard is higher than mere suspicion.\n[41] Finally, the appellant did not challenge the RPD's analysis of the various exclusion factors. The RAD, after conducting its own independent analysis, agrees with the RPD's analysis and with the Minister's arguments submitted to the RAD. Therefore, the RPD's decision is correct.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] For all the above reasons, the RAD concludes that there are serious reasons to believe that XXXX XXXX has committed a serious non-political crime outside Canada and that he must, consequently, be excluded from the protection provided by the IRPA in accordance with Article 1F(b) of the Convention.\n[43] As a person described by Article 1F(b) of the Convention, the appellant cannot be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[44] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nMokhtar Lamani\nMokhtar Lamani\nAugust 2, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's memorandum, paras. 10 and 17.\n2 Ibid.\n3 Canada (MCI) v.

Kang\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] These are my reasons for dismissing the Minister Appellant's appeal concerning XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Respondent) and confirming the Refugee Protection Division's (RPD) decision, for other reasons, that he is a Convention refugee.\n[2] The Respondent is a Ukrainian citizen. He left Ukraine as a minor with his parents, and he lived in the United States (US) as a Permanent Resident (PR) until XXXX 2014. His US PR card expired in XXXX 2017.1 He was self-represented when he wrote his Basis of Claim (BOC) form in April 2021. In February 2022, the Russian state launched a full-scale unilateral invasion of Ukraine. At his June 2022 RPD hearing, the Respondent continued to be self-represented. He alleged a fear of returning to Ukraine based on his conscientious objection to military service.2\n[3] The RPD issued a positive decision, accepting the Respondent's claim. The RPD found that the Respondent no longer has PR in the US, and he is not excluded under Article 1E. The RPD accepted that the Respondent is credible, and that he has a nexus based on his religion. The RPD also found that the Respondent is a conscientious objector, he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine, and he does not have access to state protection or an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Ukraine. On appeal, the Minister Appellant argues that the RPD's assessment of the Respondent's status as a conscientious objector is incorrect. The Respondent continues to be self-represented on appeal. I raised a new issue on appeal, and I invited submissions on whether the Respondent has established a claim based on his nationality.\n[4] The Refugee Appeal Division's (RAD) role is to decide if the RPD made the correct decision.3 Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the new issue is determinative. I find that the Respondent faces a serious possibility of persecution based on his Ukrainian nationality, he does not have access to operationally adequate state protection or an IFA in Ukraine, and he is a Convention refugee.\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD, for other reasons, that the Respondent is a Convention refugee.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES AT THE RAD\n[6] The Minister Appellant's Record was received by the RAD on July 15, 2022, accompanied by proof of service on the Respondent.4 According to RAD Rule 10(6), the Respondent must provide a written notice of intent to respond, together with the Respondent's Record, no later than 15 days after the Respondent received the Minister Appellant's Record.5 The Respondent did not provide any correspondence by this deadline, or by the date of these Reasons.\n[7] On October 25, 2022, I provided notice of the following new issues:\n* Whether the Respondent has a nexus to a Convention ground based on his Ukrainian nationality, and whether he faces a forward-looking serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine on this basis.\n* Whether the Respondent has established a personal risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, upon return to Ukraine.6\n[8] The notice also advised that I would consider the most recent National Documentation Package (NDP) for Ukraine from June 30, 2022.7 The Minister Appellant disclosed part of the United Kingdom (UK) Home Office Country Policy and Information Note Ukraine: Military service Version 8.0 June 2022. I disclosed the complete report.8 I also disclosed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Guidelines on International Protection No. 12: Claims for refugee status related to situations of armed conflict and violence.9\n[9] The Minister Appellant provided the following response:\nThe Minister would like to amend his submission in paragraph 17 of his Memorandum of Argument, which reads:\n\"17. The Minister submits that the risk of violence and even human rights violations by Russian forces are risks of a general nature, and therefore are not grounds to find that the Respondent is a person referred to in section 96 or in section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\"\nAccordingly, the Minister submits that there is a nexus to a Convention ground referred to in section 96 of IRPA based on the Respondent's Ukrainian nationality, as Russia has targeted Ukrainians.\nAccording to National Documentation Package (NDP) items 1.37 and 2.8, invading Russian military forces have committed war crimes against Ukrainians, particularly in Ukrainian territories under siege or occupation.\nAccording to NDP item 1.13, there is evidence that the atrocities committed by the Russian military against Ukrainians are motivated by genocidal intent [emphases added].10\n[10] I appreciate the Minister Appellant's openness to revisiting their position given the rapidly evolving conditions on the ground in Ukraine. I agree with the Minister Appellant's assessment.\n[11] The Minister Appellant also argues that state protection is a live issue in this appeal because Ukraine controls most of its territory.11 They also acknowledge that the state protection evidence is mixed and they are \"open to the RAD's assessment on whether or not the Respondent faces a forward-looking serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine due to his nationality.\"12 I have considered the issues of state protection and well-founded fear in my Reasons, below.\nNEW EVIDENCE IS ADMITTED BUT DOES NOT JUSTIFY HOLDING A HEARING\n[12] The Minister Appellant has provided the following new evidence on appeal:\na. UK Home Office, Country Policy and Information Note Ukraine: Military service Version 8.0 June 2022, partial excerpt; and\nb. UK National Offender Management Service, List of definitions used by the United Kingdom's National Offender Management Service, April 2013.13\n[13] The Respondent has not submitted any new evidence on appeal.\n[14] While the IRPA contains restrictions on the nature of evidence submitted to the RAD by a person who is the subject of an appeal,14 no such restrictions apply to the Minister,15 nor do they apply to evidence submitted in response to the Minister's evidence.16 The key consideration is whether the evidence can be considered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances.17\n[15] I may only hold an oral hearing where the accepted new evidence:\ni. Raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal; and\nii. Is central to the decision of the claim; and\niii. If accepted, justifies allowing or rejecting the claim.18\n[16] I find that Items (a) and (b) are admissible but do not require a hearing.\nThe evidence in Items (a) and (b) is admissible but does not require a hearing\n[17] Item (a) is an excerpt of the UK Home Office Country Policy and Information Note Ukraine: Military service Version 8.0 June 2022.19 An older version of this report appears in the NDP for Ukraine that was before the RPD.20 The Minister Appellant argues that this updated report demonstrates that \"despite the changed situation in Ukraine due to the war, it remains highly unlikely that a draft evader avoiding conscription or mobilization in Ukraine would face criminal or administrative proceedings for that act, even though prison sentences are provided for in law.\"21 Item (b) is the UK National Offender Management Service, List of definitions used by the United Kingdom's National Offender Management Service.22 The Minister Appellant argues that few draft evaders in Ukraine are imprisoned, and those who are jailed are sent to semi-open prisons \"where prisoners may undertake community or paid work.\"23\n[18] The Respondent has not replied to the Minister's appeal and does not challenge the credibility or trustworthiness of the Minister Appellant's evidence. I find that this evidence is from a reliable and trustworthy source, namely the UK government. Items (a) and (b) are admissible.\n[19] The Minister Appellant does not request a hearing.24 In my view, Items (a) and (b) do not require a hearing as they do not justify allowing or rejecting the claim. In addition, none of the new evidence on appeal raises a serious issue with respect to the Respondent's credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIssues on appeal\n[20] The Minister Appellant argues that the RPD incorrectly determined that the Respondent's religiously motivated objection to compulsory military service in Ukraine is grounds to establish that he has a well-founded fear of persecution. They argue that the RPD erred, as follows:\n* In finding that \"conscientious objectors are included in the Convention refugee definition\", contrary to the Federal Court of Appeal's (FCA) decision in Ates;25\n* In finding that the Respondent's religion, rather than his refusal to serve, would be the motive for the Ukrainian government's actions; and\n* In finding that the Respondent faces persecution due to the harsh and life-threatening conditions in Ukrainian prisons. The new evidence establishes that \"out of 295 draft evaders in Ukraine in 2021, none were imprisoned, 8 persons were sent to \"semi-open\" prisons, 175 persons were given suspended sentences, and 73 were fined\" and therefore \"the Respondent's risk of imprisonment, and thereby his risk of ill treatment amounting to persecution, is demonstrably minimal and far below the balance of probabilities threshold required for the granting of Convention refugee status.\"26\n[21] Considering the Minister Appellant's updated submission that the Respondent does have a nexus to the Convention based on his Ukrainian nationality,27 I find that the Respondent's well-founded fear on this Convention ground is the determinative issue on appeal. Even accepting, without finding, that the RPD erred in determining that the Respondent faces a serious possibility of persecution as a conscientious objector, I find that the Respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution upon return to Ukraine based on his nationality.\nThe Respondent established his identity, and he is not excluded under Article 1E\n[22] The RPD found that the Respondent established his personal and national identity as a citizen of Ukraine.28 The RPD also found that the Respondent is no longer a PR in the US, he has no ability to return to the US, and he is not excluded under Article 1E.29 The Minister Appellant has also not identified any error in these findings. Having reviewed the entire Record, I have no reason to find otherwise on appeal. I find that the Respondent has established his personal and national identity, and he is not excluded under Article 1E.\nThe Respondent is a credible witness\n[23] The RPD found that the Respondent is generally credible.30 The Minister Appellant has not identified any error in this finding, or any reason to doubt the Respondent's credibility. Having reviewed the entire Record, I have no reason to find otherwise on appeal. I find that the Respondent is credible and that he is subjectively fearful of returning to Ukraine.\nThe Respondent has established a nexus to a Convention ground\n[24] In my independent assessment, I find that the Respondent has established a nexus based on his Ukrainian nationality. I agree with the Minister Appellant's position that Ukrainians are being targeted based on their Ukrainian nationality and that \"there is evidence that the atrocities committed by the Russian military against Ukrainians are motivated by genocidal intent.\"31\n[25] The Respondent was born in Ukraine, he speaks Ukrainian, and he is a Ukrainian national. In determining whether the Respondent has a nexus to the Convention ground of nationality, I have considered the perspective of his persecutors, the Russian state and its military agents in Ukraine.32 In March 2022, the International Criminal Court prosecutor indicated that he is prepared to investigate whether genocide had taken place during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.33 The objective evidence indicates that the Russian state is targeting Ukrainians based on their nationality and that there is a \"pattern of atrocities from which an inference of intent to destroy the Ukrainian national group in part can be drawn.\"34 Specifically:\nThe Ukrainian people share an internationally recognized nationality and a common identity. In fact, according to recent studies, the vast majority of Ukrainians self-identify as Ukrainian [...] Ukrainians are defined as a national group domestically and internationally, and thus constitute a protected group under the Genocide Convention. [...]\nThe official Russian propaganda denying the existence of a Ukrainian national group implicitly designates those who consider themselves distinctly Ukrainian as deserving of punishment, either by threatening the unity of Russia, and thus guilty of treason, which Putin declared to be \"the gravest crime possible\" [...]\nAs the invasion continues, high-level officials, and State-run media commentators are painting Ukrainians more broadly in dehumanizing terms to justify atrocities. On March 17, 2022, [State Duma Deputy Chairman Pyotr] Tolstoy appeared on Channel One and argued that Russia had \"lost at least one generation of Ukrainians. The youth have been zombified.\" On March 26, 2022, the influential propagandist Margarita Simonyan asserted, \"it's no accident we call them Nazis ... What makes you a Nazi is your bestial nature, your bestial hatred and your bestial willingness to tear out the eyes of children on the basis of nationality,\" adding that \"a significant part of Ukraine, of the Ukrainian people, turned out to be in the grip of a Nazi frenzy.\"\nIncreasingly, such propaganda is being used to justify atrocities beyond the battlefield. The Ukrainian civilian population and elites are being described to Russians as their mortal enemies, some of whom must be \"liquidated\" [...]\n... \"Ukrainism is ... a subordinate element of a different and alien civilization\" [...] [emphases added]35\n[26] This dehumanizing rhetoric is significant. It indicates that, in the minds of the Russian state and its military agents, Ukrainian nationals are targeted by reason of their nationality. This objective evidence distinguishes the facts before me from the facts in Sherriff, where the Federal Court found that there was \"no bases to support the contention that [the Applicant] are being persecuted because of their 'nationality'.\"36 In the Respondent's case, there is recent, credible, and compelling objective evidence establishing that Ukrainians are being targeted based on their nationality.\n[27] In the UNHCR's Guidelines on International Protection No. 12: Claims for refugee status related to situations of armed conflict and violence, the UNHCR indicates that armed conflicts which initially appear indiscriminate may be targeted at identifiable groups.37 This is the case where \"entire groups or populations may be at risk of persecution, leaving each member of the group at risk.\"38 Specifically:\nSituations of armed conflict and violence may be rooted in, motivated or driven by, and\/or conducted along lines of race, ethnicity, religion, politics, gender or social group divides, or may impact people based on these factors. In fact, what may appear to be indiscriminate conduct (i.e. conduct whereby the persecutor is not seeking to target particular individuals), may in reality be aimed at whole communities or areas whose inhabitants are actual or perceived supporters of one of the sides in the situation of armed conflict and violence. Rarely are modern-day situations of armed conflict and violence characterised by violence that is not in one way or another aimed at particular populations, or which does not have a disproportionate effect on a particular population, establishing a causal link with one or more of the Convention grounds [emphasis added].39\n[28] I acknowledge that many Ukrainians share the Respondent's risk. However, this does not mean that the Respondent has not established a nexus, or that his claim should instead be assessed under subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.40 While generalized risk defeats a 97(1)(b) claim, it should not be imported into the analysis of section 96 claims or limit the scope of Convention refugee protection. There is no requirement for the Respondent to show that he is more at risk than others who are also at risk by reason of their nationality, a Convention ground. In Salibian the FCA held:\nIn the context of claims derived from situations of generalized oppression, therefore, the issue is not whether the claimant is more at risk than anyone else in her country, but rather whether the broadly based harassment or abuse is sufficiently serious to substantiate a claim to refugee status. If persons like the applicant may face serious harm for which the state is accountable, and if that risk is grounded in their civil or political status, then she is properly considered to be a Convention refugee [emphasis added].41\n[29] Having independently assessed the evidence, I find there is a nexus between the harm feared and the Respondent's Ukrainian nationality. He is not just a victim of indiscriminate armed conflict.\nThe Respondent faces a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine\n[30] Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the Respondent faces a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine, and that his claim is well-founded.\n[31] In Salibian, the FCA held:\n(1) the applicant does not have to show that he had himself been persecuted in the past or would himself be persecuted in the future;\n(2) the applicant can show that the fear he had resulted not from reprehensible acts committed or likely to be committed directly against him but from reprehensible acts committed or likely to be committed against members of a group to which he belonged;\n(3) situation of civil war in a given country is not an obstacle to a claim provided the fear felt is not that felt indiscriminately by all citizens as a consequence of the civil war, but that felt by the applicant himself, by a group with which he is associated, or, even, by all citizens on account of a risk of persecution based on one of the reasons stated in the definition; and\n(4) the fear felt is that of a reasonable possibility that the applicant will be persecuted if he returns to his country of origin ... [emphasis added].42\n[32] The conflict in Ukraine is a large-scale military invasion of a sovereign state by a foreign country in violation of international law.43 The FCA's holding in Salibian indicates that a Claimant who fled their country because of armed conflict can, in some circumstances, satisfy the requirements for Convention refugee protection.44 I find this to be the case on the facts before me. The Respondent's claim is based on the treatment of similarly situated people in Ukraine who have been targeted by the Russian state based on their Ukrainian nationality. This fear is felt by a group to which he is associated (Ukrainian nationals) and based on a Convention ground (nationality).\n[33] In February 2022, the Russian government launched an armed attack on Ukraine, which has \"led to a grave deterioration in the human rights situation across the country.\"45 Russian armed forces have used \"explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, missile, and air strikes.\"46 There are \"strong indications that serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and gross violations of international human rights law have occurred in the course of the conflict.\"47 The documentary evidence establishes that Russian forces are engaging in war crimes by targeting the civilian population.48 In addition to the loss of civilian life, \"tens of thousands of civilian objects have been damaged or destroyed in Ukraine, including houses, multi-storey residential buildings, administrative buildings, penitentiary institutions, police stations, medical and education facilities, water stations and electricity systems, with disastrous direct and indirect effects on civilians.\"49 Russian forces have also disappeared and summarily executed Ukrainian civilians.50\n[34] Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the Respondent faces a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Ukraine, and that his claim is well-founded.\nThe Respondent does not have access to adequate state protection or a viable IFA in Ukraine\n[35] The RPD found that the Respondent does not have access to state protection or a viable IFA in Ukraine.51 On appeal, the Minister Appellant argues that Ukraine controls most of its territory and state protection is a live issue.52 However, they acknowledge that the evidence is mixed and that they are open to the RAD's assessment.53 In my independent assessment, I find that the Respondent does not have access to adequate state protection or a viable IFA in Ukraine.\n[36] Ukraine is \"a country at war, with military priorities taking precedence over others.\"54 Specifically, \"policing, investigative and forensic capacities are stretched to their limits given the scale of the crimes and their nature\" and \"peacetime capacities are just not sufficient.\"55 There are also \"challenges around collection of huge amounts of evidence compounded by the poor crime scene administration\" and \"no infrastructure for international forensic experts to carry out their work effectively.\"56 In addition, \"the Ukrainian legal framework may not be fit for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting war crimes and crimes under international law, including violations of international humanitarian law.\"57 The preponderance of the objective evidence indicates that the Ukrainian state is unable to protect its citizens due to the ongoing and extensive Russian invasion. I find that the presumption of operationally adequate state protection is rebutted.\n[37] I further find that the Respondent does not have access to a viable IFA in Ukraine. In its March 2022 Position on Returns to Ukraine, the UNHCR notes that the situation is volatile \"in the entire territory of Ukraine\" and that it \"does not consider it appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of an internal flight or relocation alternative.\"58 Having independently assessed all the evidence, I agree. I find that there is no viable IFA for the Respondent in Ukraine.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD, for other reasons, that the Respondent is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nJennifer Pollock\nJennifer Pollock\nNovember 24, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibit 1, at p. 129.\n2 RPD hearing transcript, June 24, 2022, at pp. 13-14.\n3 Canada (MCI) v.

He is claiming refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that he was not credible.\n[3] On appeal before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), the appellant argues that his counsel before the RPD was disbarred from the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec [Quebec bar] and that he represented the appellant illegally and incompetently before the RPD. This illegal representation allegedly resulted in a breach of the principles of natural justice.\n[4] The Minister did not intervene in this appeal.\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n[5] The RPD rejected Mr. XXXX XXXX refugee protection claim on November 26, 2019. The appellant instructed his counsel before the RPD to file an appeal before the RAD. Counsel did not file the appeal and did not notify the appellant of this. On XXXX XXXX, 2020, the appellant was summoned by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). During that interview, he found out that the appeal had not been filed and that he would be removed from Canada. The appellant was detained until XXXX XXXX, 2020. On February 28, he consulted a new counsel, who submitted an urgent application for an extension of time to file an appeal, along with an appeal, to the RAD Registry. Due to the tight time frame, the RAD did not receive this urgent application until March 3, two business days later. The appellant was deported to Cameroon on XXXX XXXX, 2020. Owing to administrative errors and difficulties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not until May 11, 2021, that the RAD ruled on and allowed the appellant's application for an extension of time filed on February 28, 2020, on the grounds that the appellant had reasonably explained the delay in filing his appeal, had acted diligently, and had established an arguable appeal alleging the incompetence of his counsel. The appeal was perfected on May 11, 2021.\n[6] The appellant's counsel argues in his additional submissions dated July 15, 2021, that although the appellant was deported to Cameroon, the RAD should review his case as if he were in Canada. The RAD asked the Minister to provide submissions on the issue of jurisdiction, but the Minister did not intervene in this matter; therefore, there is no representation from the Minister. I also note that the Minister received notice of the appellant's application for an extension of time to file the appeal, as well as a notice stating that an oral hearing was to be held and outlining the credibility issues that gave rise to this hearing.\n[7] The notice required by the Federal Court's decision in Alazar1 was not sent to the Minister's counsel in this case because, in my view, the issue is not new. In fact, the issue of the RAD's jurisdiction to decide Mr. XXXX XXXX appeal after he was removed to Cameroon was raised in his memoranda that were filed with the RAD. I note that the Minister was notified of the jurisdictional issue in Mr. XXXX XXXX case on November 6, 2020, and did not intervene.\nI. THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION HAS JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE APPEAL\nANALYSIS OF JURISDICTION\n[8] To begin, I will point out that one of the IRPA's objectives is to save lives.2 It should also be noted that the IRPA is silent on the issue of the RAD's jurisdiction to decide an appeal after the appellant has been deported and is no longer in Canada. The case law is not clear on this issue either. The appellant was removed from Canada and therefore left Canada involuntarily because his counsel failed to file a notice of appeal that would have statutorily stayed the enforcement of the removal order.3 Prior to his removal, the appellant filed an application for an extension of time to file an appeal, along with a notice of appeal. In the absence of legislative provisions or case law speaking to the issue, I examined, by analogy, the Federal Court's jurisprudence regarding the mootness of an application for judicial review when a claimant is no longer in Canada.\nCase law on the mootness of a proceeding\n[9] Most of the case law pertaining to mootness in immigration matters deals with pre-removal risk assessments (PRRAs). The case law can be distinguished from the appellant's case, in particular because a PRRA is intended to assess the risk of a removal itself, and a new PRRA following a removal will rarely have any tangible impact on the issue in dispute, unlike in the case of a refugee protection claimant who was unable to pursue his appeal rights.\n[10] In fact, the Federal Court's case law makes a distinction between a person who is outside Canada and is claiming refugee protection, and a person who has already had their status determined but has been deported. In Freitas,4 the claimant had been deported and was outside Canada. The Federal Court concluded that the appeal was not moot in those circumstances. The Court's conclusion was partly based on Canada's international obligations, the IRPA's objectives, and the fact that the claimant had been deported to Venezuela, his country of nationality, following an incorrect decision rendered by the RPD (the CRDD at that time) regarding the claimant's exclusion under Article 1F of the Convention. In that case, the failed refugee protection claimant had been deported from Canada, but the Court concluded that deportation did not deprive him of his right to pursue both the judicial review and his claim for refugee protection once the Court set aside the RPD's determination. Like Mr. XXXX XXXX, the appellant in Freitas had been involuntarily deported despite his intention to pursue his appeal.\n[11] In Molnar,5 in 2015, the Federal Court confirmed the Court's approach in Freitas (decided under the old Act) and Rosa,6 while reiterating the importance of the IRPA's underlying objectives, including granting fair consideration to those fleeing persecution, offering a safe haven to persons who are able to demonstrate that they are Convention refugees, and establishing fair and efficient procedures that maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system, while upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings. I note, however, the Federal Court of Appeal's comments in Kreishan7 regarding the exceptional nature of Freitas. These cases were referenced again in Mrda8 (2016), which involved failed refugee protection claimants who had been deported to either Serbia or Croatia. In that case, the judge noted the appellants' continued interest in their judicial review following their deportation, contrary to the applicant in Harvan,9 in which the judge concluded that the issue had disappeared and that the case had become moot given the lack of any communication or participation on the part of the applicant following his removal, which, in itself, distinguishes Harvan from this appeal. Along the same lines, the Court also dismissed applications for judicial review filed by applicants who returned to their country voluntarily.10\n[12] Therefore, I draw the following conclusions from my review of the Federal Court's jurisprudence. The determination of refugee protection does not necessarily become moot once the appellants have been deported from Canada, whether or not they have been deported to their country of citizenship, when certain factors are in place. The following factors are determinative in the Federal Court's jurisprudence:\na) A refugee protection claim was made in Canada.\nb) The departure was involuntary.\nc) The case is arguable.\nd) The person has taken steps to exercise their rights.\ne) The person's behaviour is consistent with the existence of an ongoing issue, even though they are no longer in Canada.\nMr. XXXX XXXX appeal is not moot and the Refugee Appeal Division has jurisdiction to decide the appeal\n[13] In the case at hand, the appellant's representative did not file an appeal with the RAD and did not inform the appellant of this. Therefore, the appellant found himself in a situation in which his time frame to file an appeal had expired and he did not benefit from the stay set out in the IRPA regarding the enforcement of a removal order that had become enforceable. Mr. XXXX XXXX was involuntarily deported from Canada and his appeal is arguable. As soon as Mr. XXXX XXXX realized that he had been represented illegally by someone who had presented himself as a lawyer and who had not filed a notice of appeal, he retained new counsel, sent an urgent letter to the RAD Registry prior to his removal, and diligently pursued his appeal before the RAD, despite the fact that he was now in Cameroon.\n[14] I will therefore render a decision in this appeal as though the appellant were in Canada, as recommended in Freitas.\n[15] I conclude that (I) the RAD has jurisdiction to hear the appeal despite the fact that the appellant is in Cameroon; (II) some of the evidence presented on appeal is admissible; (III) there are grounds to hold an oral hearing; (IV) there was a breach of the principles of natural justice and a breach of procedural fairness in light of the representation by an unauthorized representative who tainted the proceedings and the RPD's determination; and (V) based on the evidence and testimony provided during the hearing before the RAD, as well as the recent documentary evidence on Cameroon, the appellant has established that he is a refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA.\n[16] In the following paragraphs, I will explain why I have reached these conclusions. The appeal is allowed.\nII. NEW EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL\nEvidence presented by the appellant\n[17] The RAD may allow new evidence (i) that arose after the rejection of the claim, (ii) that was not reasonably available before the RPD rendered its decision, or (iii) that the appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection.11 New evidence that meets at least one of these criteria must then comply with the three jurisprudential criteria of relevance, credibility and newness.12\n[18] The appellant filed new evidence and requested an oral hearing. He initially submitted new evidence with his memorandum (items 1 to 4), then submitted additional documents under rule 29 (items 5 to 22).\n[19] The following new evidence was presented on appeal:\n1. Appellant's affidavit signed on March 2, 2020\n2. Statement concerning the facts underlying his refugee protection claim, signed by the appellant on March 2, 2020\n3. Appellant's complaint to the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec against XXXX XXXX dated March 2, 2020\n4. Amnesty International article dated February 21, 2019, and Human Rights Watch article dated March 7, 2019\n[20] With respect to these items, the memorandum fails to comply with subparagraph 3(3)(g)(iii), because it does not explain how the documentary evidence in question meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. Nonetheless, I have sufficient information in the record to address the admissibility of the new evidence without submissions, and I relieve the appellant of this procedural defect.\n[21] The following new evidence was contained in the application filed under rule 29:\n5. An email from the appellant's counsel to Mr. XXXX dated October 13, 2021, informing him of the complaint filed with the Barreau\n6. An acknowledgment of receipt of the complaint from the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec, dated March 17, 2020\n7. Subpoena from the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec concerning XXXX XXXX, dated March 30, 2021\n8. Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec decision dated June 4, 2019 in XXXXv. Barreau de Montr\u00e9al\n9. Court of Qu\u00e9bec decision in R v. XXXX13\n10.

Letter from Reverend XXXX XXXX XXXX dated October 13, 2021, regarding the appellant's life in Cameroon\n18. Letter from Reverend XXXX XXXX dated October 21, 2021\n19. United Nations Report - Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, dated December 18, 2017, on Cameroon\n20. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, November 30, 2017\n21. Article from a website, Amnesty International, Cameroon 2020 (not dated)\n22. Article from a website, Human Rights Watch, September 22, 2021\n[22] After considering the new evidence presented on appeal (items 1 to 4), I am of the opinion that documents 1 and 3 arose after the RPD rendered its decision. They concern events that arose after the appellant found out that he was being represented by an individual who was practising law illegally and who had failed to file a notice of appeal against the RPD's decision. Clearly, this evidence was not available at the time of the decision, as it was unknown to the appellant prior to February 25, 2020. As a result, it could not have been presented prior to the RPD's decision. The evidence is new, credible and relevant to the central issue of this appeal, that is, the breach of natural justice that resulted from the appellant's representation before the RPD.\n[23] Items 2 and 4 do not meet the legislative requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and will not be admitted as new evidence. The content of the appellant's statement (item 2) concerns information that arose prior to the rejection of the refugee protection claim. It is a rewording of the appellant's Basis of Claim Form. The internet articles in item 4 are two news articles on the situation in Cameroon that predate the dismissal of the appeal and that were written and available before the rejection of the claim. These articles could reasonably have been filed prior to the RPD's decision. I am therefore of the opinion that items 2 and 4 are not new.\n[24] The new evidence in items 5 to 22 was submitted by the appellant after the perfection of his appeal. I therefore considered the factors set out in subrule 29(4) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules). Here again, the appellant did not file any motion or written submissions regarding the admissibility of the new evidence, as required by the RAD Rules.14 On the basis of the record, I am able to rule on the admissibility of the evidence without additional submissions and I therefore relieve the appellant of the prescribed procedure. With respect to the relevance and probative value of these items, documents 5, 6, 7 and 9 are relevant to the appellant's allegation that there was a breach of natural justice that resulted in a breach of procedural fairness because his representative was not practising law legally. Item 8 is a Superior Court decision in the case between Mr. XXXX and the Barreau de Montr\u00e9al [Montr\u00e9al bar] that did not involve the appellant. The Court's decision in another case involving Mr. XXXX is not relevant or probative in Mr. XXXX XXXX appeal. Item 10 is a blog article on the illegal practice of law. The existence of this practice is not in dispute in this appeal, and I consider the article to be irrelevant to the central issues of the appeal. Items 19 to 22 are part of the RPD record and are included in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Cameroon. They are therefore already part of the appeal record and do not constitute new evidence. They are not admitted as new evidence in the appeal.\n[25] The requests concerning items 8, 10 and 19 to 22 are not allowed and these items are therefore not admitted.\n[26] Items 11 to 15 consist of relevant and probative written testimony regarding the appellant's fear, his life as a fugitive, and the efforts of the Cameroonian police and government agents to find him. These issues are central to this appeal. The appellant's living conditions in Cameroon were obviously not known when he filed his appeal, prior to his removal to Cameroon. These documents could not have been presented with the appellant's record. Items 16 and 17 provide new information regarding the psychological and medical condition of the appellant, who is living in hiding. This information is relevant, although its weight remains to be established. Item 18 is a reference and support letter from the appellant's pastor in Montr\u00e9al confirming the appellant's good reputation within his religious community. It is not relevant to the issues to be determined in the appeal. Therefore, the request concerning item 18 is rejected, and this item is not admissible. With respect to whether the appellant could reasonably have been expected to have presented these documents with the appeal record, I am of the opinion that, since documents 5 to 17 concern events that arose after the appeal was perfected, the appellant could not have submitted them with the original version of the appeal record.\n[27] After assessing the factors set out in rule 29, I am of the opinion that all of the evidence submitted after the appeal was perfected, with the exception of items 8, 10 and 18, meets the requirements of rule 29. Therefore, the application to use these documents is allowed. After considering the requirements set out in subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, I am of the opinion that, for the reasons I have described, all of the above documents, with the exception of items 8 and 10, arose after the rejection of the appellant's refugee protection claim. With respect to the factors set out in Singh, I am of the opinion that the evidence is relevant because, in general, it is central to the appellant's allegation regarding his fear of persecution by extremists. I also find that the appearance of the documents does not raise any credibility concerns: item 1 is a sworn affidavit, items 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 are formal or official documents concerning the disciplinary complaint against Mr. XXXX XXXX and items 11 to 16 and 18 are signed and dated statements from members of the appellant's family and community. These affiants provided identification documents with their statements. All of the items are relevant either to the issue of the actions of the appellant's counsel or to the risk to the appellant's life since his return to Cameroon. These issues are new and did not exist at the time of the RPD's decision. I will therefore admit items 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11 to 17.\nIII. ORAL HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[28] The appellant requested an oral hearing before the RAD. The onus rests with the RAD to determine whether or not the criteria under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA have been met.15 In my opinion, the evidence that I have found to be admissible, in particular the appellant's statement dated October 5, 2021, and that of his brother, XXXX XXXX XXXX, raises issues that are central to the decision in this appeal. The credibility of the affidavits is an important issue in terms of making a finding regarding the appellant's overall credibility, and the credibility of his allegations concerning the risk he faces since returning to Cameroon. If the evidence in these affidavits is credible, it will be central to deciding the risk the appellant faces in Cameroon and would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. The affidavits justify holding an oral hearing before the RAD.16 An oral hearing was held on December 3, 2021. The Minister was notified of the oral hearing but did not participate.\nANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\n[29] The role of the RAD is not to conduct a de novo consideration of a claim for refugee protection, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.17 I conducted my own analysis of the record applying the correctness standard.18 In his memorandum,19 the appellant states that he was represented incompetently and illegally by Mr. XXXX because (a) the latter accepted fees before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) when he had been disbarred, (b) he failed to file a notice of appeal when the appellant instructed him to do so, and (c) he failed to adequately represent the appellant's case before the RPD. The appellant also states that (d) his removal violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I will not address the constitutionality of the appellant's removal, as the RAD does not have jurisdiction to rule on the removal order. I conclude that Mr. XXXX was remunerated in this case. He was not authorized to act as a paid representative before the RPD. He identified himself to the appellant as Me XXXX (that is, as a lawyer), and his representation was inadequate. For these reasons, I conclude that the proceeding and hearing before the RPD were tainted, resulting in a breach of the principles of natural justice. Furthermore, while I consider that a breach of natural justice warranting the RAD's intervention vitiates both the proceeding before the RPD and its decision, I wish to add that Mr. XXXX's failures in the RAD record caused significant harm to the appellant.\nIV. There was a breach of the principles of natural justice before the Refugee Protection Division\nThe Practice Notice - Allegations Against Former Counsel does not apply\n[30] The IRB has a practice notice that allows counsel to respond to allegations of incompetence. The purpose of the practice notice is to support the administration of justice and procedural justice. The practice notice states that a party must give notice to their former counsel of the allegations of incompetence so as to give them an opportunity to respond.20\n[31] The practice notice does not apply to Mr. XXXX XXXX It applies in cases where the person's former counsel is a lawyer, immigration consultant, or other person who is entitled to represent a person for a fee or other consideration at an IRB proceeding.21 However, Mr. XXXX was an unauthorized paid representative.\n[32] However, in the spirit of the practice notice and to promote procedural fairness, the RAD followed the procedure in the practice notice. Therefore, in the decision dated May 11, 2021, concerning the extension of time to file the appeal, the appellant was instructed to notify Mr. XXXX of the allegations. The appellant followed the instructions he was given and sent the allegations and his memorandum to Mr. XXXX on October 13, 2021.22 Mr. XXXX has not responded. I also note that the allegations were the subject of a complaint to the Barreau and that a trial was held on August 31 and September 1, 2 and 3 in Montr\u00e9al (decision dated XXXX XXXX, 2021). Mr. XXXX was undoubtedly aware of the allegations against him, but he did not respond until the RAD gave him another opportunity to comment on the Court of Qu\u00e9bec decision via a letter dated December 8, 2021 (reply dated December 20, 2021).\nMr. XXXX was not authorized to represent the appellant before the Refugee Protection Division\n[33] Under the IRPA,23 the persons who may represent or advise others before the IRB include lawyers who are members in good standing of a law society of a province, notaries who are members in good standing of the Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec [order of notaries of Quebec], students-at-law acting under the supervision of a lawyer or notary; any other members in good standing of a law society of a province or the Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec, including paralegals; and members in good standing of the College, as defined in section 2 of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act.\n[34] The persons listed in the paragraph above may represent individuals before the IRB for a fee. A limited category of people may also represent others on a pro bono basis without a fee, for example, family members, a community group or a member of a religious establishment. Although the legislation does not define unpaid representatives, I conclude that the list in subsection 91(2) of the IRPA of persons who may represent individuals is exhaustive. A representative who is not included in that list cannot charge a fee. This interpretation is consistent with the Policy for Handling Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Complaints Regarding Unauthorized, Paid Representatives,24 which states that an unpaid representative is anyone who does not charge a fee or is not receiving other consideration for representing, advising or consulting with a person who is the subject of a proceeding before the IRB, also known as a pro bono representative. A representative who receives any payment for these services at any time is considered to be a paid representative under subsection 91(2) of the IRPA.\n[35] The appellant argues that Mr. XXXX was paid and states in his sworn affidavit25 that Mr. XXXX was paid $1,000.00 to represent him in his refugee protection claim before the RPD.\n[36] In the Court of Qu\u00e9bec judgment dated XXXX XXXX, 2021,26 the Court found Mr. XXXX guilty of unauthorized professional practice of law in his representation of Mr. XXXX XXXX refugee protection claim before the RPD, but did not comment on the issue of the appellant's payment of fees to Mr. XXXX. I note, however, that the prosecution's charges involving other individuals who appeared before the IRB27 confirmed a payment of fees by those individuals.\nMr. XXXX's response\n[37] I do not accept Mr. XXXXs submissions for the reasons that follow.\n[38] Mr. XXXX was notified of the appellant's allegations against him in May 2021 and, in December 2021, he was asked to comment on the Court's judgment regarding Mr. XXXX XXXX case. In his response, he states that he did not identify himself as a lawyer to Mr. XXXX XXXX or his family; he does not address the issue of a fee. In his comments, Mr. XXXX states that he is concerned about fraud in the immigration system and wants to expose the fraud committed by the appellant and his brother (his former clients).\n[39] The panel finds it remarkable that Mr. XXXX would respond to an allegation of illegal conduct with more illegal conduct, namely, reporting his client's fraud without regard for the confidentiality of the discussions between himself and his former clients. He also explains that the appellant's sister is aware of her brothers' fraud, and he bases his accusations on the fact that many documents from Cameroon are fraudulent. Mr. XXXX concerns regarding the integrity of the immigration system are not credible. It was only after the Court of Qu\u00e9bec rendered a judgment and a guilty verdict that he reported the fraud allegedly committed by Mr. XXXX XXXX and his brother, and after the family testified against Mr. XXXX before the Court of Qu\u00e9bec in that case. I also note that, if there was indeed fraud, Mr. XXXX apparently represented Mr. XXXX XXXX in full knowledge of this.\n[40] Mr. XXXX states that the appellant's family knew that he had not presented himself as a lawyer and that he had acted on a pro bono basis. He refers the panel to the representation form filed with the RPD. Upon verification, I note that the appellant and Mr. XXXX did indeed sign a statement on the day of the RPD hearing (November 9, 2019) to the effect that the representative was not being paid. The appellant also signed an affidavit on March 2, 2020, in which he contradicts this and states that he paid Mr. XXXX $1,000. I have listened to the RPD hearing and I note that the RPD member reviewed the Policy for Handling Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Complaints Regarding Unauthorized, Paid Representatives and verified certain points with Mr. XXXX XXXX and Mr. XXXX. At the start of the hearing, the RPD member asked the appellant whether he was being represented by Mr. XXXX, whose name did not appear on the record. Mr. XXXX XXXX replied spontaneously and at once that his sister, who knows Mr. XXXX, had recommended him as a representative. He confirmed that Mr. XXXX was his counsel and worked on a pro bono basis. The claimant sometimes referred to Mr. XXXX as Mr. XXXX and, at other times, as Ma\u00eetre XXXX, which led the member to ask Mr. XXXX if he was a lawyer. Mr. XXXX replied that he had been a lawyer but no longer was. The member then asked Mr. XXXX on what authority he was representing the claimant, to which Mr. XXXX replied that he had been inspired by the generosity of his parents and a desire to volunteer. I give little weight to these questions and responses.\n[41] To begin with, neither Mr. XXXX XXXX nor Mr. XXXX were under oath at the time of this discussion. Moreover, the member's questions were superficial formalities and not very thorough. They did not confront Mr. XXXX in any way and were asked in such a way that they did not seriously test the truthfulness of the responses and would not compel an individual to tell the truth in any way. It would have been preferable for Mr. XXXX XXXX and his representative to have been under oath and questioned in such a way as to truly shed light on the issue of a fee while testing the truthfulness of their responses. That said, in my opinion, Mr. XXXX XXXX response was memorized. I find it surprising and not very credible that Mr. XXXX XXXX spontaneously answered that Mr. XXXX was his representative and, in the same breath, that he represented him on a pro bono basis when the member had not asked about a fee.\n[42] In my opinion, the unsolicited details about the pro bono nature of the representation are not details that arise naturally from the question but instead reflect a learned and memorized response. For these reasons, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the representation form signed on the day of the hearing and the answers provided by Mr. XXXX and the appellant at the hearing are not credible, were memorized and are likely untrue. I therefore give greater weight to the appellant's affidavit, in which he states under oath that he paid Mr. XXXX the sum of $1,000.\n[43] Lastly, Mr. XXXX states that the appellant's sister knew that he was not a lawyer. I consider it unlikely that the appellant's sister, who worked with Mr. XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX for many years, would be mistaken regarding the fact that he was being referred to as \"Ma\u00eetre\" and was therefore presenting himself as a lawyer. The Court of Qu\u00e9bec did not accept Mr. XXXX's testimony on this subject, and I do not accept it either. I do not believe Mr. XXXX.\nConclusions, breach of natural justice\n[44] Mr. XXXX, who presented himself as Ma\u00eetre XXXX, was paid by the appellant's family to represent the appellant before the RPD, despite having been disbarred since 1998.28 He is not an immigration consultant and held no professional status that would allow him to accept fees. He had no authority to represent the appellant before the RPD. In fact, by representing the appellant, Mr. XXXX contravened the IRPA:29\n91(1) Subject to this section, no person shall knowingly, directly or indirectly, represent or advise a person for consideration - or offer to do so - in connection with the submission of an expression of interest under subsection 10.1(3) or a proceeding or application under this Act.\n...\nPenalties\n(9) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable\n(a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine of not more than $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years, or to both; or\n(b) on summary conviction, to a fine of not more than $40,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, or to both.\n[45] By representing the appellant in this manner, Mr. XXXX was an impostor in the appellant's case before the RPD and acted illegally. This inadequate and illegal representation vitiates the entire proceeding, as well as the hearing before the RPD, and results in a breach of natural justice and procedural fairness, which constitutes an error that justifies the RAD's intervention.\n[46] Despite my foregoing conclusion that the RAD's intervention is warranted, I find it important to note the harm suffered by the appellant as a result of Mr. XXXX's failure to act before the RAD. The record indicates that the RPD rejected Mr. XXXX XXXX refugee protection claim on November 26, 2019. The appellant instructed his counsel before the RPD to file an appeal before the RAD. The notice of appeal can be filed by sending a form that requires basic information, such as the appellant's name, date of birth, file number and address, along with counsel's names and addresses. This step is initially sufficient to preserve the right of appeal of a failed refugee protection claimant before the RPD. Mr. XXXX did not complete or submit this notice, nor did he notify Mr. XXXX XXXX that he did not intend to do so. It should also be noted that, if no notice of appeal has been filed with the RAD, there is no stay of removal; therefore, failed refugee protection claimants before the RPD may be summoned by the CBSA to prepare for departure from Canada. This is precisely what happened to the appellant; on XXXX XXXX, 2020, the appellant was summoned by the CBSA and detained until XXXX XXXX, 2020. The appellant was deported to Cameroon on XXXX XXXX, 2020. The Court of Qu\u00e9bec sentenced Mr. XXXX to pay a $10,000 fine for the charge30 involving Mr. XXXX XXXX.\n[47] In my view, Mr. XXXX's failure to act caused significant harm to the appellant, namely, the loss of his stay of removal, as well as the removal itself, and compromised his right to appeal the RPD's decision. The result is a risk to the appellant and a denial of his fundamental human rights.\nV. RISK ANALYSIS\n[48] The appellant's record is similar to that of a person claiming refugee protection following events that occurred in their home country since their departure,31 or as a result of a significant increase in pre-existing factors since their departure.32\n[49] The appellant alleges that he fears the state by reason of his political opposition to the Cameroonian government. He testified that he founded a youth combat troupe named \"Troupe XXXX XXXX.\" On the day the 13-person troupe was founded (XXXX XXXX, 2018), he was appointed commander, and two days later, he was arrested, detained, beaten and threatened with death because of his opposition to the government.\n[50] The appellant was eventually released after his uncle paid a bribe. The appellant claims that he remained in hiding from the day of his release until he left for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018 (he had already obtained a visa on XXXX XXXX, 2018). He remained in Canada until XXXX XXXX, 2020, when he was deported. During his oral hearing before the RAD on December 3, 2021, the appellant testified in particular about his arrest and detention upon arriving in Cameroon on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, about the abuse he suffered in detention, and the fact that he was beaten for tarnishing the image of Cameroon according to the police. He also testified about the bribe that was demanded for his release, his living conditions since returning to Cameroon, and the need to keep relocating to avoid being tracked down by the police. The appellant's brother, Mr. XXXX, also testified about the bribe, the exchange of money and the details of the appellant's release, as well as the appellant's relocations throughout Cameroon and how the police were attempting to track him down through his friends and family.\nSince his return to Cameroon\n[51] Upon arriving at the airport in Douala, he was taken to the police station at the airport where he was asked to remove his shoes and belt. He stated that he was held in the airport cell for two days and beaten: he was struck in the abdomen and back and slapped in the face. He was threatened and was reportedly told that he would suffer and be tortured for tarnishing the image of Cameroon's government. The police officers demanded the sum of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CFA (approximately $XXXX XXXX XXXX CDN) for his release. The appellant's brother eventually collected the money and paid the officers.\n[52] The appellant's brother was instructed to take the appellant out of the capital, and on XXXX XXXX, 2020, the appellant was therefore taken to his village to live with his older brother, where he stayed for four months. However, he had to leave the village because his older brother XXXX XXXX and could not provide sufficient security for him.\n[53] The appellant relocated to the village of XXXX, then to another village approximately an eight-hour drive from XXXX, to the home of his aunt and her husband. That is where the appellant is currently hiding. He is cut off from everything, including his child, and states that his physical and psychological health is deteriorating, which his doctor confirms in a medical note filed in evidence.33 I note that, while it is not an official medical report, the doctor's notes are sufficiently credible for me to give the document some weight.\n[54] The appellant receives occasional visits from family members. His sister, who visits him to bring him groceries, informed the appellant that she is still receiving threats from police officers who are looking for him. The appellant also testified that the police have approached his friends looking for him. The appellant's sister and his friend submitted letters confirming this.34\n[55] The appellant states that he has not heard from his wife, as she also left the country as a result of the appellant's actions.\n[56] The appellant's brother testified. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed that he found the money required for the appellant to be released when he was incarcerated upon his return. He explained that he had met the police officers in a shady neighbourhood and that was when the appellant was handed over to him. He saw that his brother was traumatized and had been beaten. He confirmed that the appellant is living in hiding and that the family is living in [translation] \"a state of panic.\" According to the witness, the appellant is wanted and cannot possibly live in the capital. The police have allegedly visited Mr. XXXX four times looking for the appellant since his return. The police have also visited (at night) the appellant's sister (XXXX). According to Mr. XXXX, the last police visit was in October 2021, when they questioned the appellant's aunt in XXXX.\n[57] The appellant fears that if the police find him, he will be incarcerated in a prison for dissidents where the conditions are inhumane and that he would suffer severe abuse. The objective documentary evidence corroborates this treatment of dissidents.35\nDetermination\n[58] The appellant has established his personal identity by means of his passport issued by the Cameroonian authorities.\n[59] He testified candidly during the RAD's virtual hearing. His testimony was detailed and precise. He clearly explained the abuse he suffered upon his arrival and the reasons given by the police officers who beat him. He provided details of the life he lives as a fugitive to avoid being found by the authorities. His statements were corroborated by his brother's testimony. Their testimony was compatible and consistent with the affidavits they filed on the record. There are also numerous letters from family and friends confirming that the police are looking for the appellant and these are consistent with and support the testimony given by the appellant and his brother. There are also letters from his doctor and his pastor. Moreover, the appellant's testimony and documentary evidence are consistent with the NDP. In its entirety, the evidence is coherent, credible and internally consistent. The appellant is credible.\n[60] The appellant has established that he was arrested and beaten by police officers in Cameroon after founding a dissident youth troupe in XXXX 2018. He left Cameroon with a visa in XXXX 2018 and claimed refugee protection in Canada. Since his removal to Cameroon, the appellant has been living in hiding. He was released after the police officers were paid a bribe; however, the authorities are actively looking for him. The evidence indicates that he is wanted by the police. While the appellant's fear initially involved a risk to his life owing to his involvement in the creation of the XXXX XXXX troupe, the situation has changed, and his fear now encompasses not only a risk to his life based on his being a dissident, but also the fact that he filed a refugee protection claim in Canada and made allegations tarnishing the reputation of the Cameroonian government. The appellant's refugee protection claim reinforces his position as a dissident and undermines Cameroon in the eyes of its government. In my opinion, in light of the police officers' comments that they had beaten the appellant for tarnishing Cameroon's image abroad, it is now primarily by reason of the appellant's refugee protection claim that he is wanted by the police in Cameroon.\n[61] The documentary evidence includes reports stating that Cameroonian authorities blame the diaspora for the outbreaks of violence that have plagued the country and do not hesitate to target Cameroonians who oppose the regime abroad.36\n[62] The same documentary evidence indicates that civilian authorities do not maintain effective control over the security forces and that the socio-political crisis that began in the northwest and southwest regions of the country in 2016 resulted in serious human rights violations and abuses committed by government forces. It confirms that Cameroonian authorities have intensified the crackdown against opponents. The documentary evidence refers to a massive government crackdown on demonstrations and political activities.\n[63] The current president's regime is clearly intolerant and does not respect the fundamental rights of its citizens. Crackdowns have increased in recent years, limiting the ability of political opponents to operate freely and banning private meetings based on restrictions associated with COVID-19. Individuals are not free to express or mount dissent against the current regime. Police officers arrest opponents, who are often arrested and incarcerated in unsanitary and overcrowded institutions.37\n[64] Mr. XXXX XXXX has established the existence of a reasonable chance or serious possibility of future persecution by reason of his political opinion, in addition to the fact that he tarnished the regime's image by speaking out against it in his refugee protection claim in Canada.\nThere is no adequate state protection or internal flight alternative\n[65] The passages from the NDP cited above confirm that the security forces and the police are closely linked to the government. They participate in cracking down on opponents and act with complete impunity throughout the country. Freedom of expression is restricted, and journalists and demonstrators are arrested. The creation of opposition parties is greatly restricted and their members are arrested by the police.38 The authorities have continued to crack down on peaceful dissent, banning demonstrations and arbitrarily arresting those who exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Amnesty International reports that four members of the Stand Up For Cameroon movement, a coalition of political parties, NGOs and others, were arrested by the gendarmerie in Douala after attending a meeting at the Cameroon People's Party headquarters. They were brought before a military court on false charges of attempted conspiracy, revolution and insurrection. The judge ordered their pre-trial detention in New Bell prison, where they remained at the end of the year.39 The police and the judicial system are instruments of repression.\n[66] The police force and the gendarmerie, which are struggling with various political crises in the country, do not have the resources to protect citizens at risk, and police presence is non-existent in many areas of the country.40 In addition, there are reports of widespread corruption and bribery among security forces. Police officers continue to abuse their position with complete impunity.41\n[67] The testimony and letters submitted by the appellant's family and friends42 support the claim that the police are continuing to actively search for the appellant in different areas of the country. I am not satisfied that Mr. XXXX XXXX does not face a serious risk of persecution in Cameroon. There is no internal flight alternative (IFA) in Cameroon for a political opponent or an individual who is perceived to have tarnished the government's image, and the state, as an agent of persecution, will not protect the appellant. I also note that the appellant is living in hiding and has relocated frequently. His physical and mental health is deteriorating. In my opinion, an IFA would not be reasonable in the appellant's particular circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[68] For the foregoing reasons and in light of the most recent documentary evidence, I set aside the RPD's determination and substitute the determination that, in my opinion, should have been made, namely, that the appellant is a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA.\n[69] The appeal is allowed.\n(signed)\nRoxane Vachon\nRoxane Vachon\nFebruary 23, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

After her true identity was discovered by customs officials, she made a claim for refugee protection under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c. 27 (IRPA). She claims that if she were to return to Serbia: i) her ex-boyfriend, who abducted her and trafficked her as a sex slave for three years, will kill or disfigure her; ii) her ex-husband will abuse or kill her; and iii) she will be \"marginalized, discriminated against, and otherwise unable to function\"1 because of her Albanian ethnicity if she is returned to the Serbian-speaking parts of Serbia.\n[2] The Appellant's claim was denied by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (Board) in a February 20, 2018 decision.\n[3] The procedural history of the Appellant's claim is long and complex. Consequently, I have set out that history in an Annex to this decision. The Appellant's testimony before the RPD was heard in four sittings that took place between June 2014 and February 2018. Numerous adjournments were requested, often to accommodate the Appellant's vulnerabilities (she has been designated as a vulnerable person under the Board's Guideline on Vulnerable Persons2) or in connection with her frequent change of counsel (during the course of her refugee claim and appeal, she has been advised by at least ten different lawyers). In addition, this appeal was delayed because the Appellant brought an Application to Reopen her claim before the RPD concurrently with this appeal. That Application was denied by the RPD, the RPD's decision was set aside by the Federal Court on judicial review, and a second such application was denied in 2021.3\n[4] For the reasons that follow, I deny this appeal.\nFACTS AND ALLEGATIONS\nClaim relating to abuse from the Appellant's ex-husband\n[5] The Appellant was born in XXXX in the village of XXXX,4 which was then part of the Republic of Serbia and is now part of Kosovo.5 She married in 1996 and moved to the village of XXXX XXXX which was (and continues to be) part of Serbia.6 She and her now ex-husband had a child in XXXX and their second child was born in XXXX.7 After the birth of their children, the Appellant's ex-husband became extremely abusive, physically, verbally, and emotionally.8 The abuse escalated between 2003 and 2009. The Appellant states that her ex-husband was also abusive to their children.9\n[6] In XXXXorXXXX XXXX 2009,10 the parties stopped living together after the Appellant's ex-husband drove her to her parents' home in XXXX and told her not to return.11 When she tried to return to the family home where the children continued to live, her ex-husband beat her and sent her away.12\n[7] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2009,13 the Appellant's husband filed for divorce and custody of the children. According to the Appellant, her husband lied to the Court and said that she had disappeared.14 However, she states that the real reason she did not show up for the divorce proceeding was because she was not notified. (She states that due to the political situation, mail was not being delivered from Serbia to Kosovo and, consequently, she did not receive the communications from the Court).15 She states that the law in Serbia provides that if a spouse does not answer three letters sent by the court, a divorce proceeding is considered uncontested.16\n[8] The Appellant claims that she only came to learn of the divorce proceeding from her parents' neighbour, a police officer.17 She then went to Court to explain that she had not been notified of the proceeding. She claims that, at this time, she learned that the judge was her husband's cousin. She asked for another judge, but her request was denied.18\n[9] The Appellant sent an undated statement to the Court in XXXX-received by the Court on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010-setting out the \"real facts\" in relation to the divorce proceedings filed by her ex-husband.19 In the document, she states that he bullied and insulted her during the marriage, including by accusing her of being unfaithful;20 stresses her contributions to the marriage; states that she wants custody of the children; and states that she does not want a divorce (noting her fear that a divorce might mean that her ex-husband's new girlfriend would gain custody of her children).21\n[10] The Appellant was told by the Court that she could visit her children; however, when she tried to do so, her husband beat her severely and sent her away.22 She called the police but her husband was not charged.23 A XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 letter from her doctor states that she told her doctor that she had been beaten by her husband on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010.24\n[11] Sometime in 2010, the Appellant hired XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a lawyer from XXXX, Kosovo, and appealed the Court's decision. She claims that she gave him full authority to deal with the court proceedings related to her divorce. As discussed below, she was abducted and kept in sexual slavery for three years beginning in XXXXorXXXX XXXX 2010. During the period when she was being held against her will, XXXX XXXX XXXX acted on her behalf in relation to legal matters connected with the dissolution of her marriage.\n[12] Court documents provided by the Appellant as supporting evidence reveal the following:\n* a decision of the Magistrate's Court,25 dated either XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 or XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 (file no. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX),26 dissolved the Appellant's marriage, awarded custody to the ex-husband, and held that the Appellant was responsible for making monthly child support payments;27\n* an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011 decision of the Magistrate's Court divided the marital property and required the Appellant to pay child support;28\n* an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011 decision of the Appeal Court in Ni\u0161 (file no. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) set aside the decision of the Magistrate's Court dated either XXXX XXXXorXXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 (file no. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) and ordered the matter returned to the Magistrate's Court;29\n* an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011 a decision was issued, apparently in connection with child support;30\n* a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011 decision of the Magistrate's Court (file no XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX)31 re-examined the issue of the distribution of marital property and the payment of child support by the Appellant; and\n* a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012 decision of the Appeal Court of Ni\u0161 (file no. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) upheld the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011 Magistrate's Court's decision (file no. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX).32\nClaims of abuse by the Appellant's ex-boyfriend\n[13] In or sometime after XXXX 2010, the Appellant met her now-ex-boyfriend while taking a XXXX course.33 About a month after they met, she moved in with him.34 After a month of living with him,35 in XXXX 201036 or XXXX 2010,37 they visited Skopje, Macedonia, where he forced her into sexual slavery.38 She was moved by her captors between Macedonia, Kosovo, and Serbia, and forced to have sex with different men, sometimes three or more times daily.39 Her phone, passport, and other documentation were taken from her.40\n[14] Three years later, in XXXX 2013, she escaped her captors,41 who were drinking alcohol and not paying attention.42 She managed to find her passport and her phone, which had been hidden in another room, and ran away.43 She went to a bus station and called a friend in XXXX, Serbia; she claims that her telephone battery still had some power left in it, despite the passage of time.44 She snuck onto a bus and travelled to XXXX, where a friend gave her some money.45 On XXXX XXXX, she travelled to Belgrade,46 and then travelled on to Budapest, where she stayed for about three weeks.47 In Budapest, she called her uncle and asked him for money; she also obtained money from relatives living in Germany.48\n[15] On XXXX XXXX, 2013, the Appellant travelled to Prague and, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013, she travelled on to Slovenia, where she purchased a forged passport for XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX Euros.49 On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, she travelled to Frankfurt.50 On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, she flew from Frankfurt to the Dominican Republic,51 where she vacationed with her friend, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,52 and her brother XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.53 On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, she flew to Montreal.\nClaim relating to the Appellant's status as an ethnic Albanian\n[16] The Appellant states that, as an ethnic Albanian Serbian citizen, she never received any support or help from the police. Despite reporting the abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010, she received no assistance. She believes that this was because she is an ethnic Albanian.54\n[17] She testified that she would face discrimination amounting to persecution based on her Albanian ethnicity if she were to live in those parts of Serbia where Serbian is the predominant language. While her ethnicity would not be an issue in the parts of Serbia where the Albanian language is predominant, she would be vulnerable to her ex-husband and ex-boyfriend there.55\nAppellant's arrival in Canada and detention\n[18] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, the Appellant arrived in Montreal, using a false name (XXXX XXXX) and the forged Slovenian passport. A Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer searched her and found a Serbian passport in her own name.56 She confirmed her true identity and asked for refugee status.57 As part of the search, the official found in her possession an iPad registered to a person who had had it stolen in Prague, a laptop computer registered to another person, and two cellphones registered in the UK and US.58\n[19] She told the CBSA official that she had purchased the iPad and laptop in Germany and she was unaware that any of the devices had someone else's profile on it.59 When asked why she had two iPhones that were registered to the UK and the US-countries she claimed never to have visited-she was unable to answer.60 Later, in sworn testimony in connection with a hearing to determine whether she should be held in preventive detention, she testified that the US-registered iPhone was her personal phone-though she had forgotten the password-and then said that the phone had been left in her bag by a friend.61 In an undated declaration, translated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, the Appellant's friend, XXXX XXXX XXXX, stated that one of the phones found in the Appellant's bag belonged to her: it had been a gift from her US-based boyfriend and she had left it in the Appellant's bag.62\n[20] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, the Appellant was arrested on suspicion of bringing property obtained by crime into Canada contrary to Article 357 of the Canadian Criminal Code63 and was provided with a Legal Aid lawyer.64 She was transported to a detention facility on that day. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, she was released on bail. According to her testimony, the charges were later dropped; however, she provided no evidence to support this assertion at her hearing65 and has provided no such evidence at appeal.\n[21] On February 18, 2014, an application was made to change the location of the RPD proceeding from Montreal to Toronto. The application was allowed on March 13, 2014.66\nREQUEST FOR THE ADMISSION OF NEW EVIDENCE\n[22] The Appellant seeks the admission of the following evidence, which she submitted as part of her Appellant's Record:\n1) country documents from the Board's National Documentation Package (NDP) for Serbia, May 31, 2018 version;\n2) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 power of attorney letter, whereby the Appellant authorizes XXXX XXXX XXXX to act on her behalf in relation to her divorce proceedings;67\n3) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement submitted to Magistrate's Court (for the Appellate Court in Ni\u0161, Serbia), by XXXX XXXX XXXX, on behalf of the Appellant, contesting the XXXX XXXXor XXXX XXXX 2010 judgment of the Magistrate's Court;68\n4) a revised translation of a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 medical note, a different translation of which had previously been submitted to the RPD;69\n5) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from the Appellant's son declaring, inter alia, that his father has been abusive to his mother and repeatedly said that he wants to kill her and that his father has beaten his mother \"every second days [sic] for the last two years we've been living together,\" including an instance in 2008 where he dragged the Appellant by her hair and broke her hand;70\n6) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from the Appellant's parents declaring, inter alia, that their daughter was missing from the end of XXXX 2010 and that they reported her disappearance to the Kosovar and Serbian authorities but she was not found;71\n7) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 complaint filed by the Appellant with the Law Society of Ontario against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who acted for a time as the Appellant's RPD counsel;72\n8) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from the Law Society to the Appellant requesting documentation;73\n9) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who acted for a time as the Appellant's appeal counsel, to XXXX XXXX XXXX relating to the Law Society complaint;74\n10) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 affidavit sworn by the Appellant,75 with the following exhibits:\nA. the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 power of attorney (also document 2) above);76\nB. the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement (also document 3) above);77\nC. an untranslated copy of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 medical note (a revised translated version of which is at document 4) above);78\nD. the translation of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 medical note at exhibit C that was before the RPD;79\nE. a revised translation of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 medical note at exhibit C (also document 4) above);80\n11) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from XXXX XXXX XXXXtoXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX relating to the Law Society complaint;81\n12) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from XXXX XXXX XXXXtoXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX relating to the Law Society complaint;82\n13) a XXXX XXXX, 2018 letter from XXXX XXXX XXXXto XXXX XXXX XXXX attaching documents relating to XXXX XXXX XXXX handling of the Appellant's file;83 and\n14) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from the Law Society to the Appellant notifying her that the Law Society had commenced an investigation into XXXX XXXX XXXX conduct and enclosing a Guide to the Complaints Process at the Law Society.84\n[23] Pursuant to a January 25, 2019 Application to Submit Documents Not Previously Provided,85 the Appellant seeks the admission of the following documents:\n15) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 affidavit sworn by the Appellant explaining why documents 16)-18) ought to be admitted;86\n16) an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 certificate from the XXXX Police referring to a domestic abuse complaint made by the Appellant on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010, in relation to violence against her by her ex-husband;87\n17) an obituary for XXXX XXXX XXXX, indicating that he died on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015;88 and\n18) an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 receipt for a money transfer.89\n[24] Finally, given the amount of time that had elapsed since the RPD's decision and in view of the complexity of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) filings, I contacted the parties on July 31, 2021 seeking a status update and affording them the opportunity to provide any additional relevant submissions and\/or any new evidence that complied with subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. In reply, the Appellant sought the admission of the following new evidence on August 13, 2021:90\n19) an affidavit sworn by the Appellant on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 in which she stated, inter alia, that she had a brother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX born XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and explained why she had previously maintained that he was not her brother;91\n20) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020 letter from the Law Society disclosing the results of the Appellant's complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX;92 and\n21) screenshots93 and a video clip94 said to depict the door of the Appellant's home and a visit by the Children's Aid Society (in connection with a complaint against her fitness as a parent made by her brother, XXXX).\nLegal framework for the admission of evidence at appeal\n[25] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA limits the admission of new evidence in an appeal before the RAD to evidence that: 1) arose after the RPD's rejection of the claim; 2) was not reasonably available at the time of rejection; or 3) an appellant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of rejection. In addition, the Federal Court of Appeal in the Singh case,95 relying on its earlier decision in the Raza case,96 held that for new evidence to be admissible under subsection 110(4), it must also meet the following implied criteria: newness, credibility, and relevance.97 The Federal Court of Appeal in Singh also considered the Raza requirement of materiality but deemed it to be redundant under subsection 110(4).98\n[26] Rule 29(1) of the RAD Rules99 states that an appellant who does not provide documents with his or her Appellant's Record must not use such documents (\"post-perfection evidence\") unless allowed to do so by the RAD, pursuant to an application in accordance with Rule 37. Rule 29(3) provides that the appellant must provide an explanation of how the post-perfection evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and how it relates to the appellant. Rule 29(4) provides:\nIn deciding whether to allow an application, the RAD must consider any relevant factors, including\ni) the document's relevance and probative value;\nii) any new evidence the document brings to the appeal; and\niii) whether the person who is the subject of the appeal, with reasonable effort, could have provided the document or written submissions with the appellant's record, respondent's record or reply record.\nIf the post-perfection evidence does not meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) and Singh, there is no need to consider the Rule 29(4) factors.\nDocument 1)\n[27] Documents from the updated NDP on Serbia, which have been prepared by the Board, are admissible. Indeed, I am obliged to consider recent NDPs in assessing forward-looking risk.100\nDocuments 2)-6)\n[28] The Appellant argues that the power of attorney letter, the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement, and the revised translation of a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 medical note-documents 2)-4) respectively-meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) because they were not reasonably available or she could not reasonably have been expected to have produced them before rejection, given that her counsel, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had the documents but failed to have them translated and failed to provide them to the RPD due to incompetence. As to the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letters from her son and parents (documents 5) and 6) above), she argues she that they were not reasonably available or she could not reasonably have been expected to obtain them in advance of rejection because XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to advise her of the importance of obtaining such supporting evidence-again due to incompetence.\n[29] Because I have found below that XXXX XXXX XXXX was not incompetent, the Appellant's argument that the documents were not reasonably available or that she could not reasonably have been expected to have summitted them before rejection cannot succeed. Nor-with the exception of document 4)-did they arise after the rejection of the claim.101\n[30] Document 4), a second translation of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 medical note, is part of an argument that XXXX XXXX XXXX was incompetent (because, the Appellant argues, the translation XXXX XXXX XXXX arranged was not as good as the second translation, which XXXX XXXX XXXX arranged). As such, it is a document that arose after the rejection of the claim and which the Appellant could not reasonably have been expected to have provided before rejection (given she did not know she would be complaining about XXXX XXXX XXXX representation). It meets the Singh tests of newness, relevance, and credibility. It is admissible.\n[31] In view of the fact that consideration of documents 2), 3), 5) and 6) is essential in my assessment of the Appellant's claim that XXXX XXXX XXXX incompetence resulted in a breach of procedural fairness, I will consider them in this connection-despite their being inadmissible as new evidence. The Federal Court has made clear that there will be occasions where it is appropriate for the RAD to consider proposed new evidence despite its having found them inadmissible in accordance with subsection 110(4). In Wu, the RAD found that a new document the appellants sought the admission of at appeal was inadmissible due to a lack of credibility (in that case a summons that the RAD had found was not genuine); however, it, nevertheless, cited the excluded document as evidence of the appellant's willingness to rely on fraudulent documents. Mr. Justice Locke rejected the argument \"that, if the summons were truly excluded from the evidence, nothing more would have been said of it in the decision.\"102\nDocuments 7)-9), 11)-14) and 20)\n[32] All of these documents relate to the Appellant's Law Society complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is clear that they meet the explicit requirements of subsection 110(4), as well as the Singh requirement of newness,103 given that they all arose after the rejection of the claim. Moreover, they meet the Singh requirement of relevance: as noted, it would be impossible to decide on the Appellant's claim of breach of procedural fairness due to XXXX XXXX XXXX alleged incompetence without them. Finally, I have no reason to think that the documents lack credibility. I find that they are admissible.\nDocument 10) and its exhibits\n[33] The Appellant's XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 affidavit (document 10) above), in which she outlines the ways in which she considers the representation provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX to have been incompetent, meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) and the requirement of newness. Moreover, it meets the requirement of relevance, given its central role in my determination of the Appellant's breach of procedural fairness claim. As regards the requirement of credibility, I will admit it on the basis that it is prima facie credible, though as discussed below, I find that the Appellant is not telling the truth in parts of the affidavit.104\n[34] Exhibits A, B, and E of the Appellant's XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 affidavit-the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 power of attorney letter and the XXXX 2010 statement to the Court-are the same as documents 2), 3), and 4) above and have been dealt with above.\n[35] I do not need to consider the admissibility of exhibits C or D of the Appellant's XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 affidavit, i.e., an untranslated version of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 doctor's letter105 and the translated version submitted to the RPD,106 because they are already part of the record.\nDocuments 15)-18)\n[36] In her XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 affidavit (document 15) above), the Appellant explains why the new evidence she seeks the admission of as part of her Application to Submit Documents Not Previously Provided ought to be admitted, i.e. the police report regarding her ex-husband's abuse (document 16)), an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 online obituary of XXXX XXXX XXXX (document 17)), and a money transfer receipt (document 18)).\n[37] The Appellant acknowledges that \"both the police report and obituary were available prior to a decision being rendered on the Appellant's claim on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018\";107 however, she argues that they meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) because they were not reasonably available or she could not reasonably have been expected to have submitted them because of XXXX XXXX XXXX allegedly incompetent representation. She states that it was not until 2016, when represented by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (her RPD lawyer for a time), that she attempted to obtain the police report. She also submits that the documents meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) \"given that the Appellant was unable to obtain this evidence earlier, and did not have a meaningful opportunity to address the Board's concerns regarding the lack of evidence as she was self-represented and unaware of providing an explanation at the outset.\"108 The Appellant states that she did not receive a copy of the police report until some two weeks after the Appellant's Record had been submitted because the police required a bribe that she could not initially afford. She states, moreover, that she did not have a copy of the obituary and could not get a translation done in time to submit it with the Appellant's Record. She includes the money transfer receipt in order to show that she sent partial payment for the bribe to her father.\n[38] I find that the Appellant's affidavit meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) and the requirement of newness. It explains the proposed new evidence by outlining events that occurred after the rejection by the RPD or that only came to light thereafter (i.e., XXXX XXXX XXXX allegedly incompetent representation). Moreover, the affidavit is relevant and appears credible, given that it is a sworn document. I also find that the new evidence meets the factors set out in subparagraph 29(4) of the Rules.\n[39] As to the police report and the obituary, given that I have found that XXXX XXXX XXXX representation was not incompetent, I reject the Appellant's argument that those documents were not reasonably available on that basis. Regarding her argument that the documents meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) because, as someone who was self-represented during the third and fourth sittings, she did not know how to address the Board's concerns and was unaware of providing an explanation at the outset, this is not a reasonable explanation. A claimant may not dismiss her counsel, decide to represent herself, and then rely on her inexperience as a basis to claim evidence was not reasonably available to her.109 Moreover, the Appellant clearly knew of the importance of providing supporting evidence, given that she did so during the third and fourth sittings, despite not being represented.110\n[40] Because, neither the police report nor the obituary meet the requirements of subsection 110(4), they are inadmissible. Because the police report is inadmissible, the money transfer receipt-the sole purpose of which is to show that the Appellant sent her father funds in order to offer a bribe in connection with the police report-is not relevant. It too is inadmissible.\n[41] Finally, I note that, despite finding the obituary inadmissible, it is relevant to my consideration of the plausibility of the Appellant's claim that she was party to several court proceedings despite having been held captive when the proceedings took place. I will consider it in that context. In this regard, I rely on my reasoning in paragraph 31 above.\nDocuments 19) and 21)\n[42] I find that the Appellant's XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 affidavit (document 19)) meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) and the Singh requirement of newness. It focusses on matters that arose after the rejection of the claim by the RPD and, in relation to the Appellant's misrepresentations about her brother-she explains that she misled XXXX XXXX XXXX and omitted the brother, XXXX XXXX, from her 2014 Basis of Claim (BOC) form or accompanying narrative (BOC documents) and from her 2016 BOC amendment at her brother's insistence-explains why she could not reasonably have been expected to have provided evidence on this point before the rejection of the claim. Moreover, the affidavit is relevant and appears credible, given that it is a sworn document. I also find that the affidavit meets the factors set out in subparagraph 29(4) of the Rules.\n[43] As to the screenshots and video clip of the Appellant's front door (document 21) above), I find that they are not admissible. In her XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 affidavit, the Appellant explains she has sought the admission of the screenshots in order to provide evidence to support her claim that the Children's Aid Society came to her door in XXXX 2019. This, in turn, is to support her claim that her relationship with her brother has deteriorated and, as such, she is not in a position to provide evidence from him to support her explanation that she mischaracterized her relationship with him at his insistence. Because I accept that the Appellant and her brother had a bad relationship and because I do not rely on her misrepresentations about his existence as a basis to doubt her credibility, the evidence is not relevant to this claim. It is inadmissible.\nSummary on admissibility\n[44] In short, I have allowed the admission of the following documents: document 1): country condition evidence regarding Serbia; documents 4), 7)-9), 11)-14) and 20): documents pertaining to the Appellant's Law Society complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX; and documents 10), 15) and 19): affidavits from the Appellant.\n[45] I have found the following documents inadmissible: document 2): the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 power of attorney letter; document 3): the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement submitted to the Court by the Appellant's counsel on her behalf; document 5): a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from the Appellant's son; document 6): a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 letter from the Appellant's parents; document 16): an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 police certificate; document 17): an obituary for XXXX XXXX XXXX showing he died on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015; document 18): an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 receipt for a money transfer; and document 21): a screenshot and video clip of the Appellant's door.\nHEARING\n[46] The Appellant states that she is \"asking for an oral hearing to be held under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA only if required.\"111\n[47] The principle under subsection 110(3) of the IRPA that the RAD must proceed without a hearing, is subject to an exception, elaborated in subsection 110(6). The latter subsection provides that a hearing may be held where three conditions in relation to the new evidence are met. The new evidence must: a) raise a serious issue with respect to an appellant's credibility; b) be central to the decision with respect to his or her refugee protection claim and c) if accepted, justify allowing or rejecting his or her claim. As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh, \"Parliament's departure from the principle of a paper-based appeal...was limited.\"112\n[48] The Appellant provides no explanation or argumentation as to why the three elements of subsection 110(6) are met in this case. It does not, of course, fall to me to create arguments on behalf of the Appellant-especially given that she is represented.113 Nonetheless, I have reviewed the admissible new evidence and the record and am unable to see how a hearing could be required in this case. As is evident from my findings below, the new evidence does not raise a serious issue with respect to the Appellant's credibility that justifies allowing her claim. Consequently, the request for a hearing pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA is denied.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[49] The determinative issues are i) procedural fairness, ii) credibility, and iii) whether discrimination against ethnic Albanians in parts of Serbia where the Serbian language is predominant, or in Serbia generally, amounts to persecution.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[50] In my review of the RPD's decision, I will apply a standard of correctness.114 This is not a case where the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage in making its findings.115\nANALYSIS\nOverview of the RPD's findings and the Appellant's arguments at appeal\n[51] The RPD noted that it had a) designated the Appellant a \"vulnerable person\" under the Board's Guideline on Vulnerable Persons116 and had afforded her accommodation on that basis (i.e., reverse order questioning, frequent breaks, and the use of a female interpreter); b) given her the opportunity to present her own submissions at the last two sittings of her hearing when she represented herself; and c) considered the Board's Gender Guideline117 in assessing her claim.\n[52] As to the substance of her claim, the RPD found that it lacked credibility. In particular, it found a) that she had omitted from her 2014 BOC documents her claim that her ex-husband had abused her during their marriage; b) her claim that her ex-husband physically abused her during their marriage was not mentioned in the court documents in connection with their divorce; c) her claim that her husband had continued to threaten to kill her after she came to Canada, in particular, that he had made such a threat in late 2017, was only raised in the fourth sitting of her hearing, after being prompted by its questions on the continuing existence of such a threat; d) and her claim that the proceedings in connection with her divorce took place despite her claim that she was held captive during most of the period in which those proceedings took place was implausible.\n[53] Based on this, it held i) that the Appellant had not been the victim of domestic violence at the hands of her ex-husband in Serbia prior to 2010; ii) that, whether or not she had been a victim of physical violence at the hands of her ex-husband prior to 2010, there was less than a mere possibility that the Appellant would face domestic violence at the hands of her husband if she were to return to Serbia, iii) that she had not been held captive for three years by her ex-boyfriend or his associates; and iv) that, while she was of Albanian ethnicity, she had not shown that she would face persecution in Serbia based on that ethnicity.\n[54] The Appellant argues that the RPD's credibility findings were in error. In addition, she argues that she was denied natural justice because XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to provide her with adequate representation. She does not contest how the RPD applied the Gender Guideline to her claim; nor does she contest the RPD's treatment of her as a partially unrepresented claimant or its treatment of her as a vulnerable person-with one exception, in the context of one of her arguments against one of the RPD's credibility findings.118 This is discussed below.\n1. Were the principles of natural justice breached as a result of XXXX XXXX XXXX alleged incompetence?\nBackground to the Appellant's Law Society complaint and XXXX XXXX XXXX defence\n[55] As noted, the RPD decision rejecting the Appellant's claim was signed on XXXX XXXX, 2018. When she received the decision, the Appellant sought legal advice from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who advised her not to pursue an appeal and wrote a letter recommending that Legal Aid not fund her appeal.119\n[56] She next sought legal advice from the XXXX XXXX Clinic and the YWCA. It was there she learned that she could make a claim against XXXX XXXX XXXX as part of her appeal.120\n[57] At the suggestion of the YWCA, the Appellant contacted another lawyer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.121 On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, XXXX XXXX XXXX drafted an opinion letter noting XXXX XXXX XXXX alleged shortcomings and recommending that the Appellant i) file an Application to Reopen her RPD claim; ii) file a humanitarian and compassionate claim (and recommending that the Appellant retain XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as counsel as regards these two proceedings); and iii) appeal the RPD decision (and recommending that the Appellant retain XXXX XXXX XXXX in this regard).122\n[58] The Appellant hired XXXX XXXX XXXX as her legal counsel on or about XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, the Appellant signed a Law Society complaint form alleging that XXXX XXXX XXXX representation was incompetent.123 On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, the Appellant swore an affidavit detailing the alleged incompetence on the part of XXXX XXXX XXXX,124 which XXXX XXXX XXXX sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX on the same day, requesting her reply to the allegations.125 On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, XXXX XXXX XXXX provided a summary response,126 which included documents from the Appellant's legal file.127\n[59] The Appellant was notified on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 that the Law Society's Enforcement Department had opened an investigation in connection with the Appellant's complaint.128 Sometime between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, XXXX XXXX XXXX received a copy of the complaint the Appellant had made to the Law Society.129\n[60] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, XXXX XXXX XXXX filed the Appellant's Record in this appeal. The Record features an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 memorandum arguing the bases for this appeal, focussing, inter alia, on XXXX XXXX XXXX representation of the Appellant. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, XXXX XXXX XXXX provided the Law Society with \"a full response to the complaint.\"130 XXXX XXXX XXXX response to the Law Society is not part of this record.\n[61] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, XXXX XXXX XXXX counsel, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, contacted the RAD Registry enclosing i) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 affidavit sworn by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with Exhibits A-M attached,131 and ii) his submissions in support of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.132 He noted that he had previously sent the documents to the RPD Registry in connection with the Appellant's Application to Reopen her claim before the RPD. While that Application is not part of the record herein, it would appear that it too was, at least in part, based on a claim basis that XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to provide adequate representation.133\nLegal framework\n[62] The legal framework governing claims of breach of procedural fairness due to alleged incompetence by previous counsel in the context of refugee claims was very clearly set out by Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Crampton in Memari:134\n[33] In R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 26, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that for this ground of challenge to succeed, \"it must be established, first, that counsel's acts or omissions constituted incompetence [the performance component] and second, that a miscarriage of justice resulted [the prejudice component].\" The Court elaborated as follows:\n27 Incompetence is determined by a reasonableness standard. The analysis proceeds upon a strong presumption that counsel's conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. The onus is on the appellant to establish the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment. The wisdom of hindsight has no place in this assessment.\n28 Miscarriages of justice may take many forms in this context. In some instances, counsel's performance may have resulted in procedural unfairness. In others, the reliability of the trial's result may have been compromised.\n29 In those cases where it is apparent that no prejudice has occurred, it will usually be undesirable for appellate courts to consider the performance component of the analysis. The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel's performance or professional conduct. The latter is left to the profession's self governing body [...]\n[34] Although G.D.B. was a criminal case and the Supreme Court's analysis of the issue of the right to effective counsel was focused on persons charged with a felony, this Court has recognized this right in the refugee context (see, for example, Gulishvili v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 1667, 2002 FCT 1200; Shirwa v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1993 CanLII 3026 (FCA), [1994] 2 F.C. 51 at 60-64 (T.D.)).\n[35] It may also be noted that subsection 167(1) of the IRPA provides a statutory right to be represented by counsel, to persons who are the subject of Board proceedings.\n[36] However, in proceedings under the IRPA, the incompetence of counsel will only constitute a breach of natural justice in \"extraordinary circumstances\" (Huynh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration (1993), 65 F.T.R. 11 at 15 (T.D.)). With respect to the performance component, at a minimum, \"the incompetence or negligence of the applicant's representative [must be] sufficiently specific and clearly supported by the evidence\" (Shirwa, above, at 60). With respect to the prejudice component, the Court must be satisfied that a miscarriage of justice resulted. Consistent with the extraordinary nature of this ground of challenge, the performance component must be exceptional and the miscarriage of justice component must be manifested in procedural unfairness, the reliability of the trial result having been compromised, or another readily apparent form.\nBases of the Appellant's claim that XXXX XXXX XXXX was incompetent\n[63] The Appellant argues that she was denied natural justice because XXXX XXXX XXXX made the following errors:\na) she failed to include the Appellant's claim that she had been subjected to domestic violence by her husband in her 2014 BOC documents, despite having been told about this by the Appellant, and failed to ensure that the Appellant's BOC documents were interpreted to her before the Appellant signed them or after they were corrected;\nb) she failed to have two documents translated and submitted to the RPD: i) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 document granting power of attorney to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX her legal counsel in Serbia,135 and ii) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement submitted to Magistrate's Court (for the Appeal Court in Ni\u0161, Serbia), on behalf of the Appellant, by XXXX XXXX XXXX;136\nc) she failed to notice obvious translation errors in the translation of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 note from the Appellant's doctor that was submitted to the RPD;137 and\nd) she failed to advise the Appellant that she needed to obtain additional supporting evidence, such as letters from family members or friends.138\na) Failure to include domestic violence as a ground for refugee protection and failure to translate and correct the BOC documents\n[64] The Appellant and XXXX XXXX XXXX provide differing version of the events leading to the drafting, translation, and correction of the 2014 BOC documents. As Madam Justice Elliot noted in the recent Sayegh case, which featured a claim that the applicant's counsel in a refugee claim was negligent: \"[T]here are two sides to every story.\"139 In order to determine if the Appellant has met her burden of proving that acts or omissions of XXXX XXXX XXXX led to a breach of natural justice, it falls to me to determine, as best I can, who is telling the truth regarding certain aspects of XXXX XXXX XXXX representation.\nAppellant's version of the drafting of the 2014 BOC documents\n[65] The Appellant states that she was introduced to XXXX XXXX XXXX while residing at XXXX XXXX Welcome Centre in Toronto.140 She states that she met XXXX XXXX XXXX a second time, when an interpreter, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was present-apparently at XXXX XXXX XXXX office. She claims that during this meeting she told XXXX XXXX XXXX about having \"experienced violence from my ex-husband,\" that \"she had been in an abusive relationship for the last five or six years of marriage...,\" and that she \"feared her husband if [she] was forced to return to Serbia.\"141 The Appellant does not provide the dates of the meetings.\n[66] The Appellant states that at her next appointment with XXXX XXXX XXXX, she and XXXX XXXX XXXX drove to XXXX XXXX XXXX home to retrieve a document.142 Again, she does not provide a date. She claims that, while travelling back to XXXX XXXX XXXX office, she began to tell XXXX XXXX XXXX her story over the telephone. After returning to XXXX XXXX XXXX office, the Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and another person she does not identify sat together and she told her story.143 XXXX XXXX XXXX interpreted his notes to the Appellant. While he did not mention her domestic violence claim at that point,144 she states that she had already advised XXXX XXXX XXXX about this.145 XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX then went to XXXX XXXX XXXX office, where XXXX XXXX XXXX typed up the BOC documents.146 While XXXX XXXX XXXX remained in her office, XXXX XXXX XXXX brought the typed version to the Appellant and told her where to sign.147 He did not translate the BOC documents to her, did not ask her if everything was correct, and did not explain the significance of her signature.148\n[67] The Appellant states that she took a copy of the BOC documents home and reviewed them the next day.149 She states that, while she has little ability to speak or read English, she was able to find some errors in the documents by relying on Google Translate. She did not notice that her domestic violence claim had not been included.150 She told XXXX XXXX XXXX about the errors that she had noticed,151 and XXXX XXXX XXXX promised her that they would be corrected. XXXX XXXX XXXX did not arrange for a corrected version interpreted to her.152\nXXXX XXXX XXXX version of the drafting of the 2014 BOC documents\n[68] According to XXXX XXXX XXXX, she met the Appellant for the first time in XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX and the Appellant, accompanied by XXXX XXXX XXXX, came to her office the following day. XXXX XXXX XXXX was retained by the Appellant on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014.153 On that day, XXXX XXXX XXXX applied for an extension of time to file the BOC documents,154 which was granted, allowing her until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 to file.155\n[69] Sometime before XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, the Appellant provided XXXX XXXX XXXX with a handwritten history in Albanian and English,156 which XXXX XXXX XXXX used to prepare a draft of her BOC documents. XXXX XXXX XXXX states that, on XXXX XXXX XXXX the Appellant came to her office and, from there, they both travelled to XXXX XXXX XXXX home, reviewing the Appellant's story en route. At no time did they discuss the issue of domestic violence.157 XXXX XXXX XXXX states that her \"notes indicate that XXXX XXXX XXXX [sic] started to interpret the draft material while [the Appellant] and I were on the way back to the office.\"158\n[70] According to XXXX XXXX XXXX, when she and the Appellant arrived back at the office they met with XXXX XXXX XXXX who interpreted the BOC documents to the Appellant.159 There were some corrections to the documents but none of them had anything to do with domestic violence.160 \"The BOC clearly sets out what [the Appellant] reported to me about the basis of her claim for refugee status and it was read back to [the Appellant] so that she could assure herself that it was accurate and complete.\"161 Later that day, XXXX XXXX XXXX came to her office and a \"few corrections were made\"162 before the Appellant and XXXX XXXX XXXX signed the BOC form.163 The documents were faxed to the Board between 4:46 and 4:48, on the afternoon of XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010.164 (No corrected version of the 2014 BOC documents was submitted to the Board.)\n[71] XXXX XXXX XXXX states that, during the preparation of her BOC documents, the Appellant never cited domestic violence as a basis for her claim, never claimed that domestic violence was the reason that she had fled Serbia, and never claimed to fear future violence from her ex-husband.165 Instead, her emphasis was on her claim of forced prostitution and human trafficking.166 Nor, XXXX XXXX XXXX states, did the Appellant raise the issue at subsequent meetings she had with the Appellant on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2014.167\nAppellant's arguments\n[72] First, the Appellant argues that her recollection that she related her story to XXXX XXXX XXXX during the return car trip on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 is likely correct-rather than XXXX XXXX XXXX story that XXXX XXXX XXXX interpreted a draft of the BOC documents for the Appellant during the car ride168-because XXXX XXXX XXXX dockets show that any such draft would have been \"skeletal at best.\"169 Moreover, even if a draft of the BOC documents had been translated in the car, XXXX XXXX XXXX was still at fault because she should have arranged for the BOC documents to be interpreted to the Appellant again, after the corrections the Appellant had pointed out to her were implemented.170\n[73] Second, she argues that three documents in the supporting evidence XXXX XXXX XXXX provided to the RPD make clear that domestic violence was an issue: i) the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 note from her doctor, which states that she complained of having been hit by her husband; ii) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement171 to the Magistrate's Court to the effect that the Appellant was bullied and insulted by her ex-husband; and iii) an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 report from her XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,172 relaying her claim to have been physically abused and dominated by him.\n[74] Third, she argues that the fact that she signed the BOC form and swore to its truthfulness and accuracy, cannot be used to impugn her credibility because she was not aware of the contents and unaware whether it included the information she provided to her counsel.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX arguments\n[75] In the documents XXXX XXXX XXXX and her counsel submitted in response to the Appellant's allegations, they made a number of arguments, including:173\n* the Appellant's handwritten history shows that she did not raise a fear that her ex-husband would continue to abuse her; her notes focus on her fear of her ex-boyfriend.174\n* the Appellant lacks credibility as evidenced by her willingness to mislead XXXX XXXX XXXX about the identity of her brother and her having entered Canada on a forged passport and with stolen electronics;\n* the Appellant was, at all relevant times, in a state of personal chaos and both physically and emotionally unavailable to XXXX XXXX XXXX and she failed to include this information in her affidavits in support of her complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX;\n* while the XXXX XXXX, 2014 XXXX report does refer to domestic abuse, its focus is on forced prostitution and human trafficking and, moreover, the author of a XXXX report on the Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,175 makes no mention of physical abuse by her ex-husband;\n* the Appellant and XXXX XXXX XXXX, made formal attestations on the BOC form that it had been translated to the Appellant;\n* the Appellant's knowledge of English is better than she claims it is; this is shown by i) XXXX XXXX XXXX remark in a 2014 memo to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant's RPD counsel, for a time, after XXXX XXXX XXXX and before XXXX XXXX XXXX) in the context of the transfer of the Appellant's legal file to him;176 and ii) the fact that the Appellant's interview with XXXX XXXX XXXX took place in English;177\n* XXXX XXXX XXXX role in the Appellant's claim-which began on or about XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, when she was retained, and ended when she learned, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014,178 that she had been replaced by XXXX XXXX XXXX-lasted for a comparatively short time relative to the claim, which took some four years to decide;\n* the Appellant was represented by two other experienced counsel in her RPD claim-XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX-neither of whom contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX about any alleged mistakes; and\n* XXXX XXXX XXXX is an experienced lawyer, having practised exclusively in the area of immigration and refugee law for over 30 years.\nMy findings\n[76] Appellant's first argument. The Appellant's arguments are not persuasive. First, I do not see how anything turns on whether, during the car ride, the Appellant told XXXX XXXX XXXX her story or whether he translated an early draft to her. Neither XXXX XXXX XXXX nor the Appellant claim that the BOC documents were fully translated during the drive to the office: XXXX XXXX XXXX claims that the documents were translated later that day after they had been finalized and it is clear from the Appellant's evidence that the documents were not completed until later that day. As to the Appellant's argument that no matter what happened in the car back to the office XXXX XXXX XXXX was at fault for not having the BOC documents translated after she had corrected the errors that the Appellant discovered, this may only be made if I accept the Appellant's version of events in connection with her discovery of the errors and her reporting those errors to XXXX XXXX XXXX. As discussed below, I do not.\n[77] Appellant's second argument. It is not clear that XXXX XXXX XXXX was aware of the documents referred to by the Appellant when she drafted the BOC documents. Clearly, she was not aware of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 report from the Appellant's XXXX XXXX it was not in existence at the time the BOC documents were signed on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014. Nor is there any no mention of a fear of continuing abuse in the XXXX report. While that report does refer to the Appellant speaking about being physically abused by her ex-husband,179 its discussion of the Appellant's future fears is focussed on her ex-boyfriend who held her captive.180\n[78] As to the other two documents-the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 doctor's note and the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement-it is clear from the translator's Declaration of Translation181 that they had not been formally translated until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, over a month after the BOC documents were finalized. This timing conforms with XXXX XXXX XXXX uncontradicted sworn evidence that a discussion of which documents to translate took place on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, among the Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a translator working for XXXX XXXX XXXX.182\n[79] Even if the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 doctor's note and the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement had been informally translated to XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time the BOC documents were prepared-perhaps by XXXX XXXX XXXX during the process of drafting the BOC documents-her awareness of them provides little support for the Appellant's argument that XXXX XXXX XXXX was negligent. First, as discussed below, the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement from the Appellant's lawyer on her behalf does not refer to physical violence. While the Appellant is no doubt correct that non-physical abuse is still violence (see the discussion below in relation to the RPD's credibility findings), the claim by the Appellant that she experienced non-physical abuse years earlier by a person who had for several years been estranged from her may not be said, without more, to show that the Appellant advised XXXX XXXX XXXX that she feared that her husband will kill or disfigure her if she returns to Serbia. As to the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 doctor's note, it does refer to physical abuse. Again, however, knowledge on the part of XXXX XXXX XXXX of physical abuse that occurred years ago by a person who was estranged from the Appellant does not, without more, mean that the Appellant advised XXXX XXXX XXXX that she feared that her ex-husband would kill her upon return to Serbia.\n[80] Appellant's third argument. I find that the Appellant's XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 formal declaration183 that the content of her BOC form was \"complete, true and correct\" and that \"the entire content of this form and all attached documents have been interpreted to me\" ought not to be lightly disregarded.184 Nor should XXXX XXXX XXXX formal declaration-\"I...hereby declare that I have accurately interpreted the entire content of this form and all attached documents ...[and] the claimant has assured me that he\/she understood the entire content of this form...\"185-be lightly disregarded.\n[81] A scenario whereby the Appellant signed such important documents without reading them and XXXX XXXX XXXX misrepresented having translated them is certainly not inconceivable. However, none of this explains why the Appellant testified, under oath, that the BOC form had been translated to her in her first sitting of her hearing on June 16, 2014.186 Almost four years later, at the fourth sitting on February 6, 2018, in connection with questions about why her claim against her ex-husband was not in her 2014 BOC documents, she changed her answer and stated that she could not recall if the documents had been translated to her.187 It was only after the rejection of her claim later in 2018, in the context of her Law Society complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX (some four years after she testified the documents had been translated and several months after she had testified that she did not recall whether they had been), that she swore she had told XXXX XXXX XXXX about the threat from her ex-husband but did not realize that this claim was not included because the BOC documents had not been translated to her.\n[82] My conclusion regarding the drafting and translation of the 2014 BOC documents. I find that the Appellant is not telling the truth when she claims that she told XXXX XXXX XXXX that she feared her ex-husband when they prepared her BOC documents or when she says that that she was not aware of XXXX XXXX XXXX omission because XXXX XXXX XXXX neglected to have the BOC documents and corrections translated for her.\n[83] First, common sense suggests that someone's sworn testimony in XXXX 2014 about whether the documents had been translated-i.e., some three months after the BOC documents were signed-is more apt to be correct than her recollection some four years later, i.e. when she made her XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 complaint to the Law Society and swore her XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 affidavit stating the opposite. Second, in deciding on whose story to believe, I must also have regard to the Appellant's medical evidence-which, as noted below, she argues provides an explanation for her having forgotten to mention that her ex-husband had threatened her in late 2015-showing that she suffers from \"XXXX thought and XXXX function.\"188 Finally, the fact that the Appellant's own handwritten notes detailing her claim make no mention of her being fearful of her ex-husband, provide a strong indication that she did not raise a fear of her ex-husband in her claim.189\n[84] Because of this finding, I do not need to consider whether the performance or prejudice components in the jurisprudence relating to breach of natural justice had been met in respect of a failure of XXXX XXXX XXXX to include the Appellant's fear of her ex-husband in her refugee claim or to translate the BOC documents or amend them after the Appellant requested that they be amended.\n[85] Law Society's finding. I note that the Law Society Investigator made certain findings of her own in this regard. I am not, of course bound by the Law Society Investigator's findings. I do not have the details of the evidence considered by the Law Society Investigator; nor is it clear to me whether the Law Society Investigator had access to all of the evidence available to me.\n[86] However, I note that the Law Society Investigator held as follows regarding the Appellant's claims that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not include reference in her BOC documents to her fear of her ex-husband, despite having been advised by the Appellant of her continuing fear of her ex-husband, and did not arrange for the BOC documents to be interpreted to her:\nI have determined that the evidence is insufficient to establish that [XXXX XXXX XXXX] was aware that your Basis of Claim form was not properly interpreted back to you. The evidence indicated that an interpreter was present when the Basis of Claim form was signed, and that you and the interpreter sat in one room, and the Lawyer remained in her office contacting the Refugee Protection Division about your case while the interpreter was translating the form back to you. In your interview, you stated that the interpreter did translate the narrative back to you, but it was not correctly translated and he made some mistakes. The Lawyer does not speak Albanian and would not have known if the interpreter made some mistakes. For these reasons, I have concluded the Lawyer did not fail to serve you in regards [sic] to having the Basis of Claim form interpreted to you.\nI have also concluded that the evidence is insufficient to establish that the Lawyer failed to serve you by failing to mention the physical abuse by your ex-spouse in your Basis of Claim form. Your evidence is that you raised a fear of physical abuse by your ex-spouse prior to signing your Basis of Claim form, while the Lawyer's evidence is that you did not. Given the conflicting perspectives between you, and the lack of independent corroborative evidence, the required standard of proof has not been met.190\n[87] Despite this, however, the Law Society Investigator held that XXXX XXXX XXXX had failed to serve the Appellant based, inter alia, on her failure to turn her mind to the possibility that a claim based on domestic violence might exist, given XXXX XXXX XXXX awareness of the historical abuse by her ex-husband. It held as follows:\nI have concluded that the evidence established that the Lawyer failed to inquire whether you had a fear of your ex-spouse after receiving medical and XXXX evidence that you had been physically assaulted by him. The evidence established that the Lawyer disclosed medical evidence indicating that you had been injured due to a physical assault by your ex-spouse, without discussing the issue of physical abuse with you. There was no evidence indicating that the Lawyer turned her mind to the possibility of a claim based on domestic violence, despite disclosing evidence of physical abuse.191\nThe Investigator concluded that the appropriate regulatory response by the Law Society was to caution XXXX XXXX XXXX for failing to serve the Appellant.192\n[88] While I agree, based on the evidence before me, that that there is \"no evidence indicating that [XXXX XXXX XXXX] turned her mind to the possibility of a claim based on domestic violence, despite disclosing evidence of physical abuse,\" I find that this does not represent conduct that meets the performance requirement of the jurisprudence regarding a breach of procedural fairness. After all, in my assessment of whether XXXX XXXX XXXX performance resulted in a breach of procedural fairness, I am bound by the \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\" set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in G.D.B.193 and the finding in Huynh,194 endorsed in Memari,195 that \"in proceedings under the IRPA, the incompetence of counsel will only constitute a breach of natural justice in 'extraordinary circumstances.'\" The circumstances of this case, which involve historical spousal abuse from a person from whom the Appellant has been estranged for several years, may not, without more, be said to warrant a finding that XXXX XXXX XXXX ought reasonably to have pursued (or turned her mind to) a possible claim that the Appellant feared further spousal abuse.\nb) Failure to have all relevant documents translated and provided to the RPD\nAppellant's arguments\n[89] The Appellant states that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not consult her about which documents were the most important for translation; nor did she tell her which ones had not been translated so she could seek additional funds from her sister to ensure that they were translated (which, she says, she had made clear to XXXX XXXX XXXX she wanted to do).196 She argues that this amounted to incompetence because two important documents were not translated and provided to the RPD: i) the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 letter by which she granted XXXX XXXX XXXX power of attorney in connection with her divorce litigation, which, she argues, would have countered the RPD's finding that it was implausible that the court proceedings would have taken place while she was held captive,197 and ii) the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement submitted to Magistrate's Court (for the Appellate Court in Ni\u0161, Serbia), by XXXX XXXX XXXX on behalf of the Appellant,198 which, she argues, would have shown a) that her allegations that she was verbally offended and harassed by her ex-husband were true and b) that she contested the proceedings through her counsel, rather than being present herself.199 The latter document states as follows:\nthe defendant made it clear in the full hearing that in the last year of their marriage their relationship deteriorated as the plaintiff began to intensely harass the defendant, started accusing her also of conjugal infidelity and verbally offending her, and that she did not leave the marital union on her own....200\nIt also makes clear that the Appellant was acting \"[t]hrough her counsel, XXXX XXXX\" and describes him as her \"Proxy.\"\nXXXX XXXX XXXX version of events\n[90] XXXX XXXX XXXX states that she does not recall how documents were selected for translation but recalls that there was a meeting on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 among the Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and that XXXX XXXX XXXX would have chosen the most important documents for the claim, having regard to the limitations imposed by Legal Aid.201 XXXX XXXX XXXX also states that the Appellant did not advise her that her sister was willing to pay for additional translations.202\nMy findings\n[91] First, I find that the Appellant's argument that, but for XXXX XXXX XXXX incompetence, the RPD would have had before it a translated versions of the two documents, is undermined by the fact that the Appellant showed herself to be capable of submitting-and aware of the importance of submitting-supporting evidence. During the time when the Appellant was representing herself before the RPD, she introduced several additional supporting documents.203 Nevertheless, I will consider each document that the Appellant claims XXXX XXXX XXXX was negligent not to have arranged for the translation of.\n[92] i) Power of attorney letter. I do not find that XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to have the power of attorney document translated and submitted to the RPD meets the performance component of the G.D.B. test discussed above; instead, I find that the decision not to do so fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance in the circumstances. I note that XXXX XXXX XXXX reference to Legal Aid Ontario imposing limitations on the number of translated pages it would pay for is uncontested. As to the Appellant's claim that she advised XXXX XXXX XXXX that her sister could pay for the translation of any documents that were not covered by Legal Aid, in her letter outlining the results of the Law Society's investigation of the Appellant's complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Investigator refers to XXXX XXXX XXXX evidence that \"she could not ask you to pay for the translation of the additional documents as Legal Aid Ontario prohibits this.\"204 While, as noted, I am not bound by the findings of the Law Society's investigation, given that the letter from the Law Society was introduced by the Appellant herself and given that she does not contest that statement, I rely on it as reflecting Legal Aid Ontario policy.\n[93] While XXXX XXXX XXXX represented the Appellant for some XXXX months in 2014,205 XXXX XXXX XXXX represented the Appellant for some XXXX months in 2016 and 2017.206 (It is not clear from the record how long XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Appellant's legal representative between XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, represented her.207) Like XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX did not have the power of attorney letter translated or submitted to the RPD-though she did arrange for the submission of other additional supporting evidence.208 While not determinative of whether XXXX XXXX XXXX performance was negligent, XXXX XXXX XXXX inaction makes clear that at least two lawyers who were familiar with the Appellant's claim took the view that the translation and submission of the document was either not necessary or not possible in view of whatever financial or other constraints were in existence. Finally, while, as noted, I am not bound by the finding emerging from the Law Society investigation of XXXX XXXX XXXX representation, I note that that investigation, undertaken by a society charged with ensuring the competence of lawyers, found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that XXXX XXXX XXXX decision not to have the document translated and submitted to the RPD amounted to a failure of XXXX XXXX XXXX to serve the Appellant.\n[94] In the alternative, in case I am incorrect and XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to ensure that the power of attorney document was translated and provided to the RPD does meet the performance component, I will briefly consider the prejudice component. I find that the prejudice component has not been met because, in my view, even if the RPD had had the power of attorney letter before it, it is likely that it would still have found that the Appellant's claim that XXXX XXXX XXXX acted on her behalf in the various court proceedings while she was being held captive was implausible. Moreover, the fact that XXXX XXXX XXXX was replaced as counsel after some ten months is also relevant to the performance component: because XXXX XXXX XXXX had every opportunity to arrange for the translation and submission of the power of attorney letter, any prejudice caused by a failure of XXXX XXXX XXXX was superseded by XXXX XXXX XXXX inaction. That is to say, if failure to have the document translated and submitted did lead to prejudice, it was XXXX XXXX XXXX failure. The Appellant does not claim that XXXX XXXX XXXX legal representation was inadequate.\n[95] ii) XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement. I do not find that XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to have the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement translated and submitted to the RPD meets the performance component of the jurisprudence discussed above. Once again, for the reasons outlined above in paragraphs 90 and 91, I find that her decision not to do so fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance in the circumstances.\n[96] Moreover, the essence of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement relating to non-physical abuse by the Appellant's ex-husband may be found in the Appellant's XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 submission to the Magistrate's Court-a document that XXXX XXXX XXXX did arrange to have translated and did provide to the RPD. The latter document states:\nThe truth is totally different, marital relations were not disturbed until Plaintiff, last couple of years, more accurately 5-6-years ago started bullying the respondent in several ways. It has gained in intensity, and in last months he was telling her that she is unfaithful, told her insults and similar words.209\nWhen this wording is compared to the wording in the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement, set out above in paragraph 89 above, it is clear that the RPD did have before it the essence of the Appellant's claims regarding her ex-husband's conduct.\n[97] In case I am incorrect in my finding regarding the performance component, I will consider the prejudice component, first, with respect to the Appellant's claim that the letter would have shown that she was verbally offended and harassed by her ex-husband. I note that, although the document does refer to the Appellant's claim that her ex-husband bullied and harassed her, it makes no mention of physical abuse. Given that it was the absence of evidence of physical abuse in the Serbian court documents that the RPD expressed concern about in its credibility finding, I find it unlikely that the admission of the document would have impacted on the RPD's finding. The fact that the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 submission was before the RPD and that its did refer to non-physical abuse, supports this finding.\n[98] As regards the question (also in the alternative) of whether XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to provide the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement to the RPD meets the prejudice component in the second way she claims, i.e. that it would have shown that she contested the court proceedings through her counsel, thereby undermining the RPD's finding that it was implausible that the proceedings would have continued while she was in detention, I find that it does not. I find that, even with the power of attorney document, the Appellant's claim that the court proceedings occurred while she was being held captive would likely have been found to be implausible by the RPD. In addition, I refer to my observations above in relation to the fact that another legal counsel, XXXX XXXX XXXX, took the same approach as XXXX XXXX XXXX and to findings of the Law Society Investigator.\nc) Translation of the doctor's letter\nAppellant's argument\n[99] The Appellant argues that XXXX XXXX XXXX should have known that the translation of a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 doctor's note-i.e., \"According to the statement of the patient, she received two days ago hits in head, right arm and shank\"210-was inaccurate based on a visual comparison (a box and a date were not translated, a notation was not translated, and the stamps and markings were not translated). She argues that a new translation arranged by XXXX XXXX XXXX provides further details about her injury resulting from abuse by her ex-husband.211\nXXXX XXXX XXXX argument\n[100] XXXX XXXX XXXX argues that she cannot be faulted for the quality of the translation, given that she does not speak Albanian or Serbian. She also states that XXXX XXXX XXXX, the translator, had worked for her firm for many years.\nMy finding\n[101] I see no fault on the part of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX First, I do not see-and the Appellant has not made clear-why the second translation of the letter is preferable to the first. There was little need to translate the stamp, given that the original document (containing the stamp) had been provided to the RPD. Nor do I see how the greater detail provided in the second version was helpful to the Appellant's claim. When I compare the two translations, I find that the essence of each translation is the same. Second, it would be unreasonable to fault XXXX XXXX XXXX, as someone who does not speak the Albanian or Serbian languages, for relying on a translator whose work is known to her. The performance component has not been met and XXXX XXXX XXXX conduct or inaction did not lead to a breach of natural justice.\nd) Failure to advise the Appellant to obtain additional supporting evidence\nAppellant's arguments\n[102] The Appellant claims that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not adequately inform her about what evidence she needed to obtain for her RPD claim, such as letters from her parents or children about her capture by her ex-boyfriend or her ex-husband's continued threats.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX arguments\n[103] XXXX XXXX XXXX does not dispute that she did not advise the Appellant to obtain supporting letters from her family. However, she argues i) that she did not advise the Appellant to obtain evidence to support a claim that her ex-husband was a continuing threat because the Appellant did not make her aware that she continued to fear her ex-husband and ii) that she did not advise her to obtain supporting letters from family members and friends regarding her fear of her ex-boyfriend because it is her practice not to advise clients to do so in such circumstances, lest the agent of persecution learn of the claim and harm the claimant.\nMy finding\n[104] i) Supporting letters showing her ex-husband was a continuing threat. Given that I have found that the Appellant did not inform XXXX XXXX XXXX that she had a continuing fear of her ex-husband, I find that there is no basis for a claim that XXXX XXXX XXXX was obliged to advise her to obtain supporting evidence of this. As discussed above, a reference to past abuse by a long-estranged ex-husband did not, in the circumstances, create an obligation on XXXX XXXX XXXX to determine whether the Appellant had a current fear of her ex-husband; nor did it create an obligation for her to seek support for such a possible fear.\n[105] ii) Supporting letters about her disappearance. XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to advise the Appellant to seek supporting documents from her family regarding her claim to have been kept captive for three years does not fall outside the test of reasonable professional conduct as referred to by the Supreme Court in G.D.B. In support of this, I note my findings above that the Appellant was obliged to comply with the limitations imposed by the Law Society and that the documents from her family members, if obtained, would have had to be translated (as is clear from the letters the Appellant seeks to have admitted at appeal).212 While not determinative, the fact that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not apparently advise the Appellant to obtain such evidence provides support for my finding that XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to do so did not meet the performance component.\n[106] I note further that XXXX XXXX XXXX claim that she deliberately did not advise the Appellant to seek supporting documents from her family in Serbia lest she endanger her safety, is not challenged and I have no reason not to believe this is true. To the contrary, while speaking of a different time period, the Appellant, in her most recent affidavit sworn on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, states that the reason she decided not to attempt to obtain any further supporting evidence in summer 2021 (when the RAD offered her such an opportunity) was for the very reason XXXX XXXX XXXX identified. She averred: \"It is not practical for me to try to obtain new information or an update as there is a serious risk that my whereabouts will be compromised and known to those that I fear in Serbia, namely my ex-husband...and his associates.\"213 I find that XXXX XXXX XXXX conduct does not meet the performance component.\n[107] I note, once again, that the Law Society's Investigator found that XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to advise the Appellant of what further evidence she could obtain to support her claim-specifically her failure to advise her \"to obtain any further corroborating evidence from your country of origin, including affidavits or letters from your family members\"214-contributed to a finding (along with her failure to turn her mind to the possible of a claim based on domestic abuse, discussed above) that she had failed to serve the Appellant, which warranted a caution by the Law Society. Once again, I note that I am not bound by the Investigator's findings. My assessment of XXXX XXXX XXXX conduct for the purposes of the performance element of her breach of natural justice claim is governed by the relevant case law, discussed above.\n[108] If I am incorrect, and the failure to advise the Appellant to obtain letters from her family members to support her claim to fear her husband and\/or to have been abducted and held for three years does amount to a breach of the performance component, I refer to my finding above that, because XXXX XXXX XXXX was replaced by XXXX XXXX XXXX after some ten months, any prejudicial result arising from XXXX XXXX XXXX inaction was superseded by XXXX XXXX XXXX apparent failure to recommend that the Appellant obtain the supporting letters from her family members.\nConclusion on whether the principles of natural justice were breached as a result of the effectiveness of XXXX XXXX XXXX representation\n[109] I find that there has been no breach of natural justice based on the quality of representation provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I find, instead, that it is likely that the Appellant fabricated her complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX with a view to overcoming the RPD's primary concern about her credibility, i.e., her failure to raise her claim that she fears returning to Serbia because of her ex-husband in her 2014 BOC documents or in the 2016 amendment to her BOC narrative. The Appellant's willingness to make such a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX in order that she might be successful at appeal, seriously undermines her credibility. I now turn to her credibility as assessed by the RPD.\n2. Credibility\n[110] The RPD held that the Appellant \"did not testify in a straightforward manner\"; \"[h]er responses were evasive and indirect\"; \"[t]here were numerous attempts to embellish her testimony\"; and her \"story was inconsistent and contained many contradictions.\"215 In particular:\na) It held that the main reason it found her not to be credible was based on an adverse inference it drew because she made no claim that her ex-husband had been abusive in their marriage in her 2014 BOC documents; it was not until she amended her BOC narrative in 2016 that she made this claim: \"after our children were born...he became abusive, physically, verbally, and emotionally...[t]his continued throughout our marriage.\"216 It did not accept her explanations that she told XXXX XXXX XXXX about the domestic violence and did not know why it was not in her original BOC documents, that she had not read those documents, and that they had not been translated to her.\nb) It drew a negative inference from the fact that there is no mention of physical abuse by her ex-husband in the Serbian court documents in connection with the proceedings relating to the dissolution of her marriage-in particular, the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement setting out the Appellant's version of events. It rejected her explanation that, as far as she knew, she had mentioned the physical abuse.\nc) It drew a negative credibility finding from the fact that she did not mention, until questioned by the RPD, that her ex-husband had continued to issue threats against her even after she arrived in Canada, i.e. she testified that her children told her that their father had stated that he wanted her dead some three to four months before the final sitting of her hearing, on February 6, 2018. It found her explanation that she did not mention this earlier because she may have forgotten about it was unreasonable.\nd) Her claim that her interests were represented in the legal processes connected to the dissolution of her marriage in 2011 and 2012, despite being held captive at the time, was implausible.\nBased on the foregoing, it concluded: i) that the Appellant had not been the victim of domestic violence at the hands of her ex-husband in Serbia prior to 2010; ii) that, whether or not she had been a victim of physical violence at the hands of her ex-husband prior to 2010, there was less than a mere possibility that the Appellant would face domestic violence at the hands of her husband if she were to return to Serbia, and iii) that she had not been held captive for three years.\n[111] The Appellant argues that the credibility findings were in error.\nFinding a): Negative credibility findings based on the Appellant's omission of the domestic abuse allegations from her 2014 BOC documents\n[112] The Appellant argues, first, that the jurisprudence217 and the RPD Rules218 provide that claimants are entitled to amend their BOC documents. Given this, she argues that the RPD erred because it failed to provide a reasonable basis for drawing a negative credibility finding based on her omission of her domestic violence claim in her 2014 BOC documents.\n[113] Second, she argues the RPD ignored other documents-the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement she submitted to the Magistrate's Court in Serbia;219 the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 doctor's note;220 and the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 XXXX report221-which discuss domestic violence; their existence, she argues, shows that her claim in her amended BOC that her ex-husband had abused her during their marriage was not being advanced as a last-minute fabrication.222\n[114] Third, she argues that the RPD erred by rejecting her explanation of why her 2014 BOC documents did not refer to the domestic abuse she suffered from during her marriage-i.e., that she told XXXX XXXX XXXX that she feared future abuse from her ex-husband but, without her knowledge, XXXX XXXX XXXX had not included this in the 2014 BOC documents and that she was not aware of this at the time because the documents were not translated to her and she had signed them without reading them-without \"analysis or investigation.\"223 It simply stated that it did not find the explanation to be reasonable.\n[115] Fourth, and in support of her third argument, she argues that the RPD failed to exercise its duty to take an active role in determining if her allegations against XXXX XXXX XXXX were true, especially given that she was designated as a vulnerable person and was self-represented for part of the hearing. She claims that such an obligation is a reasonable procedural expectation and is required by the Code of Conduct for Members of the Board,224 the Board's Policy on Disclosing Information Regarding the Conduct of Authorized Representatives to Regulatory Bodies,225 and the Guideline on Vulnerable Persons.226\nMy findings on the Appellant's arguments\n[116] Appellant's first argument. It is uncontroversial that claimants are entitled to amend their BOC form and narrative; the RPD did not suggest otherwise. Instead, the RPD drew a negative inference from the fact that the Appellant's XXXX 2014 BOC documents made no mention of her ex-husband being abusive and the abuse was mentioned for the first time when she amended her BOC narrative in 2016, given that it did not accept her explanation for this. As it noted the failure to include the domestic violence allegations in her 2014 BOC documents was significant \"as domestic violence now appears to be material to the claim.\"227 I do not find its reasoning to be deficient. The basis for its conclusion is, to my mind, self-evident, i.e. the fact that she added information that is material to a new refugee claim (involving another agent of persecution) some two years after she made her original claim, raises the possibility that, absent reasonable explanation, she was attempting to strengthen her claim by fabricating a new basis for it. The Appellant's argument below-that the existence of documentation in which claimed to have had suffered from domestic abuse in 2010 and 2014 proves that she did not fabricate her claim at the last minute in 2016-shows that she was fully aware of the basis for the RPD's credibility finding.\n[117] Appellant's second argument. As to the three documents referred to by the Appellant-the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement showing that the Appellant claimed non-physical abuse from her ex-husband (\"bullying [her] in several ways,\" \"telling her that she was unfaithful, told her insults and similar words\"228); the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 doctor's letter showing that the Appellant claimed to be the victim of physical abuse by her husband on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010, during the period when they were separated (\"According to the statement of the patient, she received two days ago hits in head, right arm and shank from her husband. Visible blood hematoma on right forearm, size 5 cm. on inner side\"229); and the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 XXXX report revealing that the Appellant reported that she had been the victim of both physical and non-physical abuse by her husband during their marriage (\"Throughout the marriage, [the Appellant] reports having been physically abused and dominated by her husband, and that the physical abuse escalated between 2003-2009\"230)-it is true that they indicate that the Appellant claimed that her ex-husband was abusive well before the 2016 amendment to her BOC narrative. However, the fact remains that in her 2014 BOC documents-in which she set out the basis for her claim and which she declared were complete, true, and correct231-she failed mention something, i.e. domestic abuse, that she subsequently wants to rely on as a basis to claim that she fears her ex-husband will harm her on return to Serbia. Absent reasonable explanation, her failure to include a claim that she had been abused by her husband-a claim which is clearly material to her claim to fear her ex-husband if she returns to Serbia-may warrant a negative credibility finding.232\n[118] Even if the Appellant is correct that her earlier claims that her ex-husband was abusive show that she was not making a last-minute fabrication when she amended her claim in 2016 to include mention of domestic abuse and, as such, ought to have been taken into consideration by the RPD in reaching its credibility finding, they do not show that her claim that she continues to fear her ex-husband-an essential element of her claim that her husband is an agent of persecution-was not a last-minute fabrication. As I read its decision, the RPD drew a negative credibility finding not just because the Appellant failed to mention her ex-husband's domestic violence in her 2014 BOC documents, but also because of the related factor that she did not claim to fear her ex-husband because of his abusive behaviour in the 2014 BOC documents. This is clear from its observation that it was drawing \"a negative inference regarding her credibility based on the omission of the domestic violence allegations from [her] original BOC as domestic violence now appears to be material to the claim.\"233 [emphasis added] Certainly that is the reason why I find that a negative credibility finding is warranted.\n[119] In case I am incorrect, and the Appellant's references to past domestic abuse in the three documents may be said to undermine the RPD's credibility finding, then the question becomes: did the RPD erroneously ignore these documents? Clearly the RPD did consider the March 31, 2010 statement in its assessment of this credibility finding, as well as in its finding b). However, the RPD did not specifically consider the other two documents in connection with this credibility finding. Assuming, without deciding, that its failure to specifically invoke the two documents in the context of this credibility finding was an error,234 I will correct this by considering the two documents myself in my reassessment of the correctness of this credibility finding.\n[120] Appellant's third argument. I find that the RPD's reasons for rejecting her explanation as to why she failed to include reference to domestic abuse in her original BOC documents were clear: it did not accept as reasonable or truthful her claim that she told XXXX XXXX XXXX about her ex-husband's abuse but that XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to include it in the 2014 BOC documents and the Appellant did not realize this at the time because she did not read the documents and they were not translated to her. In support of this, it noted, first, that she had declared that the BOC documents were true and had been accurately translated235 and, second, that the fact she had not included any reference to her ex-husband's physical abuse in her court documents-in particular the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement she submitted to the Court setting out what she considered to be \"the real facts\" (see credibility finding b) below)-supported its view.\n[121] If the RPD's reasoning is judged to have been deficient, I have rectified that in my analysis above in connection with the wrongful complaint of incompetence against XXXX XXXX XXXX. While the question above, i.e. whether or not XXXX XXXX XXXX conduct led to a breach of natural justice, is, of course, of a different nature, much of my reasoning, including my analysis of the Appellant's evolving story about her knowledge of the contents of her BOC documents,236 is relevant to an analysis of whether the explanation the Appellant offers for her failure to include a reference to domestic violence in her marriage in the 2014 BOC documents is reasonable and truthful.\n[122] Appellant's fourth argument. The Appellant did not advise the RPD, at the third and fourth sittings when she was representing herself, that XXXX XXXX XXXX was negligent. Instead, she when she was asked why her claim to fear her ex-husband was not in her 2014 BOC documents, she said-at both the third and fourth sittings-that she had told XXXX XXXX XXXX but had not read the BOC documents.237 When asked why she had not read the BOC documents, she replied \"I do not know.\"238 When asked if the documents were read back to her in the Albanian language, she replied \"I do not remember.\"239 Nor did the RPD \"dismiss[] the allegations as unfounded,\" as the Appellant states it did. It simply exercised its duty to decide whether or not it found the Appellant's explanation was reasonable-and found that it was not.\n[123] Even if the Appellant's testimony at the third and fourth sittings could be said to amount to a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, it I find that none of the documents referred by the Appellant-i.e., the Code of Conduct, the Policy on Disclosing Information Regarding the Conduct of Authorized Representative, or the Guideline on Vulnerable Persons-whether read separately or collectively may be said to impose an obligation on the Board to conduct a misconduct investigation on its own initiative, simply because an unrepresented claimant who has been designated a vulnerable person blames her counsel for the omission of information from her BOC documents. The Appellant offers no support for her claim that there is a \"reasonable procedural expectation\" that before the Board may reject an explanation whereby a claimant blames her lawyer for an ostensible credibility problem, it must conduct an assessment of the competence of the lawyer's representation-whether or not the Appellant has been designated as a vulnerable person.\n[124] Finally, given my finding above that XXXX XXXX XXXX representation of the Appellant was not negligent, even if there was some sort of implied duty on the part of the RPD to engage in a misconduct investigation in the circumstances, the RPD's breach of that putative obligation has caused the Appellant no harm.\nMy conclusion\n[125] I find that even having regard to the fact that the Appellant claimed to have been abused by her ex-husband before she amended her BOC narrative in 2016-as discussed in the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement, the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 doctor's letter, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 XXXX report-a negative inference is warranted from the fact that she failed to include that claim in her 2014 BOC documents. For the reasons set out above, I find that her explanation for her failure to include reference to her ex-husband's abuse is not reasonable or truthful. Her decision to add the claim of domestic abuse, and its impact on her claim that she fears returning to Serbia because of her ex-husband, leaves me to conclude that she has modified her claim with a view to increasing her chances of success.\n[126] Her omission of the domestic violence allegation from her 2014 BOC documents undermines her credibility. Moreover, the fact that I have found her explanation to be lacking in truthfulness also warrants negative credibility finding.\nFinding b): Negative credibility findings based on the fact that the court documents do not refer to physical violence by her ex-husband\nThe Appellant's arguments\n[127] The Appellant argues that the RPD's finding that she had not mentioned physical abuse in the court documents, in particular the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement, was incorrect because it ignored the evidence. She notes that her XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement made reference to her ex-husband's bullying and insults, which are features of domestic violence, and which often escalate to physical abuse. The court documents did not, she argues, need to explicitly record the types of physical violence to which she was subjected in order for the RPD to be satisfied that domestic violence occurred.\n[128] Second, she relies on evidence in the NDP which provides that: i) some judges in Serbia have advised women to give up domestic violence cases to expedite their ongoing divorce cases, ii) some judges in Serbia have distrusted victims' claims of domestic violence, iii) the court setting in Serbian family court may be confrontational, iv) femicide rarely receives an appropriate response from the Serbian authorities, and v) women in Serbia often refrain from reporting domestic violence because of fear or shame or because they know it is considered a private matter by institutions in Serbia.\nMy findings regarding the Appellant's arguments\n[129] Appellant's first argument. I find that the RPD did not ignore the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement from the Appellant to the Court which referred to non-physical domestic violence in the form of bullying and insults. To the contrary, it acknowledged at paragraph 18 that that the court documents confirmed that the marital relationship had broken down. Its point was not that violence must be physical to be deplorable or that bullying and insults could not escalate into physical violence. It was that if physical domestic abuse existed, it was likely in its view that that would have been included in the court documents, in particular the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 letter, which the Appellant prepared in order to provide the Court in Serbia with her version of events.240\n[130] Appellant's second argument. I accept that the country condition evidence shows that the approach of the authorities in Serbia to domestic abuse is less enlightened than it should be. The Appellant made a similar point when she stated in her amended BOC narrative, that it \"was a difficult time in the region as Serbia and Kosovo separated and domestic abuse and child abuse is normalized and not taken seriously by the authorities.\"241\n[131] However, when asked by the RPD about the fact that the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement did not mention physical violence, the Appellant did not point to the attitude of the authorities towards domestic abuse as the reason she did not mention physical abuse in the context of her divorce proceedings. To the contrary, she testified as follows:\nRPD: Okay, is this [referring to the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement to the Court] your signature?\nAppellant: Yes.\n...\nRPD: Okay and you talk here about he brought another woman to your home right after he took you to your parents. And then here it says that you do not want a divorce, you want to go back with him with the kids, to your kids even if the price is that your husband keeps his current woman as well. Do you remember this statement now?\nAppellant: Yes.\nRPD: Okay, so my question is in this statement to the courts why do you not mention that you experienced violence at your husband's hands?\nAppellant: Ma'am, this is the letter that I obtained from the doctor.\nRPD: Okay, so I will talk to you about the doctor's note in a moment; right now I want to talk to you about the court document and I just want to understand why you did not say in your statement to the court that the ... that your ex-husband was physically abusive to you?\nAppellant: As far as I remember ma'am, I have mentioned that and he beat me up even after we were divorced.242\nIn short, she first offered a non-responsive answer and then she stated that she had included reference to physical domestic abuse, despite that fact that she had not.\n[132] Given her testimony, and given the fact that she did include reference to her ex-husband's non-physical abuse in the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement and did report her husband's physical abuse on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 to the police,243 I do not accept that the reason the issue of her husband's physical abuse was not discussed in her divorce proceedings was due to her fear that domestic abuse would not be taken seriously by the authorities.\n[133] I find that the fact that the Appellant did not report physical abuse by her ex-husband during her marriage in her XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 statement to the Court-a document which she describes as \"the real facts\" that would counter \"a lot of false allegations\" made by her ex-husband when he filed for divorce244 and in which she accuses her ex-husband of bullying, insults, and unfaithfulness-undermines the credibility of her claim that physical domestic abuse took place during their marriage, while they were living together.\nFinding c): Negative credibility findings based on the omission of continued death threats by the Appellant's ex-husband\nAppellant's arguments\n[134] The Appellant does not contest the RPD's finding that the death threats from her husband were not mentioned before her she testified about them at the fourth sitting, held on February 6, 2018.245 Instead, she argues that the RPD erred by rejecting her explanation that she had maybe forgotten that her husband had threatened her. In support of this, she claims that the RPD ignored the following medical evidence:246\n1. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 XXXX report,247 which refers to symptoms that are consistent with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that can take the form of an inability to concentrate, confused thought, impaired short-term recall, and difficulty recalling specific details of the past;\n2. Letters, dated XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX Hospital,248 which state that the Appellant was suffering from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and other conditions which can impact on her capacity to provide a comprehensive and consistent narrative; and\n3. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 XXXX report,249 which states that the Appellant had problems with XXXXandXXXX XXXX and that she had become distracted and forgetful, e.g., she confused dates and details of past events, had difficulty recalling people's names and telephone numbers, and misplaced her keys.\nIn addition, the Appellant argues that the RPD acted unreasonably because it was unwilling to address her memory issues when she raised them when asked to affirm that she would tell the truth at the third sitting.250\nAppellant's testimony\n[135] The Appellant testified as follows at the fourth sitting, on February 6, 2018:\nRPD: Have you received any threats from your former husband?\nAppellant: Of course, yes.\nRPD: When?\nAppellant: All the time, during the court proceedings...\nRPD: Okay, my fault. Since coming to Canada have you received any threats from your former husband?\nAppellant: I mean that is why he mistreated my children because they contacted me.\nRPD: So, since come to Canada have you received any threats from your former husband?\nAppellant: I did [not] have any direct contact with him, but through my kids.\nRPD: So, you received indirect threats from him?\nAppellant: Yes.\nRPD: Tell me about the threats?\nAppellant: He told the kids that \"I want to see your mother dead\" and he told them so many things, you know, nonsense like I mean \"your mother does not love you,\" which is not true and at the same time he has been mistreating the kids. And told them if \"I see your mother she is not going to exist anymore....\"\nRPD: When did the children tell you that?\nAppellant: Three, four months ago.\nRPD: Is that the first time they had told you that, three, four months ago?\nAppellant: No, they have told me even prior to that. This, three four months ago, was when both of them were being mistreated.\n...\nRPD: Why did you not write in your story that since coming to Canada the children have reported to you that your husband is making threats against you?\nAppellant: I mean things get mixed up, I do not remember anything, maybe I forgot.251\nMy findings on the Appellant's arguments\n[136] Appellant's first argument. I accept that the medical evidence makes clear the healthcare professionals retained by the Appellant have reported on her claims to have concentration and memory problems which could impact on her capacity to provide a comprehensive and consistent narrative. It is, nevertheless, my responsibility to decide if the RPD was correct in rejecting the Appellant's claim that her memory problems were, as she testified, \"maybe\" the reason she failed to mention her ex-husband's continuing threats earlier. Unlike the doctors or medical professionals who wrote the reports, I have the benefit of the entire RPD Record, as well as the new documents submitted at appeal, including those in connection with the Appellant's complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX.252 In addition, unlike the medical professionals, part of my function is to determine whether the Appellant is telling the truth in her refugee claim, in part, based on her performance at the hearing.253\n[137] Even having regard to the medical evidence of the Appellant's potential forgetfulness, for the following reasons I find that it is more likely that the Appellant did not forget about her ex-husband's threats. First, I agree with the RPD that death threats are not something one would readily forget given their nature; forgetting death threats is not akin to forgetting dates, details, or the order of past events. Second, I have found that the Appellant is lacking in credibility in many ways and I find that someone who is willing to lie about other factors-including something as significant as a the competence of her former counsel-is more likely to be willing to lie about having forgotten that she received threats from her husband. Third, she had ample opportunity to raise the threats over the course of some four years, i.e. in her original BOC documents, in her amended BOC narrative, or in the first three sittings of her hearing, but did not.\n[138] Appellant's second argument. As to the Appellant's argument that the RPD acted unreasonably because it was unwilling to address her memory issues when she raised them in connection with her affirmation that she would tell the truth at the third sitting, I disagree. The RPD reasonably expected that the Appellant would, as required, swear to the truthfulness of her testimony before giving it. While it did not discuss her memory problems at the time, there is nothing to indicate it ignored them; indeed, it referred to the XXXX report in paragraph 12 of its decision. If the Appellant wanted to introduce evidence beyond the considerable expert evidence that she did introduce on the subject of her mental health-e.g., through testimony-she had every opportunity to do so.\nMy conclusion\n[139] I agree with the RPD that the Appellant's failure to mention earlier that her ex-husband had continued to threaten her since she came to Canada, including in the months before the fourth sitting of her hearing, undermines her credibility. I find that it is more likely that, when she came to realize during questioning by the RPD at the fourth sitting that there was a need for her ex-husband to continue to want to harm her in order for her claim in connection with him to succeed, she made up the threats. When challenged based on the fact that she had not mentioned these threats before, she lied once again by suggesting that she may have forgotten the threats.\nConclusion on whether there is a serious possibility that the Appellant's ex-husband will harm her on return to Serbia\n[140] Based on the three negative credibility inferences it drew against the Appellant in connection with her alleged of her ex-husband-i.e. because of i) her omission of the domestic abuse during their marriage in her 2014 BOC documents, ii) the lack of reference to his physical domestic abuse in the court documents, and iii) her failure to mention that he had threatened her while she was in Canada until questioned on the subject-the RPD drew two conclusions: i) that the Appellant has not suffered physical abuse during her marriage before 2010 and ii) whether or not there was physical abuse during her marriage before 2010, there was less than a mere possibility that she would face violence at the hands of her ex-husband if she returned to Serbia.\n[141] Because I agree with the RPD's conclusion that the there is not a serious possibility that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of harm by her ex-husband if she returns to Serbia whether or not she suffered abuse before 2010, I need not decide whether it was correct in its finding that no such abuse took place.\n[142] As discussed above, I agree with the RPD's credibility three findings in relation to her claim to fear her ex-husband. In addition, I draw an additional credibility finding in this regard. While, as discussed above, the Appellant raises her ex-husband's domestic abuse during their marriage in the 2016 amendment to her BOC narrative, she makes no claim in that amendment that she fears that that her ex-husband will continue to harm her. Instead, in that amendment, she exclusively claims that she seeks protection because of her ex-boyfriend: \"I am claiming Refugee Protection in Canada because I fear [her ex-boyfriend] who sold me into human trafficking and his associates\"254 and, later, \"I fear returning to Serbia, as I fear [her ex-boyfriend, one of his associates, named Edi,] and their associates. I fear that they would harm my parents and my children and that they will force me to work as a prostitute if they do not kill me.\"255 The first time the Appellant claimed that she feared returning to Serbia because of her ex-husband was at the second sitting of her hearing, on April 18, 2016: \"I cannot go back because of my ex-husband.... He will mistreat me like he used to mistreat me in the past. Maybe he will kill me.\"256 Her omission of her claim to fear her ex-husband from her 2014 BOC documents and her 2016 amendment, warrant a negative credibility finding.\n[143] In addition to the credibility findings, I find that the evidence does not support a finding that the Appellant's ex-husband would be inclined to harm her. First, it is clear from the evidence that the Appellant has been estranged from her ex-husband for over ten years and that he has remarried and started a new family. It is also clear from the evidence that the Appellant has not spoken with her ex-husband since 2010. These factors begs the question, why would her ex-husband want to cause her harm in 2022?\n[144] When asked by the RPD why she feared her ex-husband, the Appellant referred to their battle for the custody of their children, which took place over ten years ago.257 However, the fact that the Appellant's evidence is that that the Serbian Courts ruled in her husband's favour258 and she had had \"no success whatsoever...\"259 (and that her lack of success is reflected in court documents260), undermines this claim. I find it unlikely that the Appellant's ex-husband would want to kill or otherwise harm her in connection with court proceedings that took place between nine and eleven years ago, in which he was entirely successful. While it is true, of course, that an agent of persecution is not necessarily governed by logic or rationality, the question of whether her ex-husband has a motive to harm the Appellant is a relevant factor in deciding whether there is a serious possibility he will harm her in the future.\n[145] I conclude that there is not a serious possibility that her ex-husband will harm the Appellant upon her return to Serbia. As noted, I reach this finding whether or not the Appellant's ex-husband physically abused her during their marriage, before 2010.\nFinding d) Is it implausible that her interests were represented in the divorce-related proceedings while she was being held captive?\nAppellant's arguments\n[146] First, the Appellant, relying on paragraph 14 of Santos,261 argues that the \"clearest of cases\" test for a finding by the Board of implausibility has not been met because the RPD's finding was based on its assessment of court proceedings in Serbia, devoid of any references to evidence that supported its inferences.\n[147] Second, she argues that given the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 power of attorney letter which she has sought the admission of at appeal, the RPD's finding of implausibility is not reasonable.262\n[148] Third, she relies on two documents that were before the RPD, which, she argues, show that she was not personally present during the proceedings: i) a XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012 Appeal Court decision263 stating that she was \"located in Canada with her father...,\" which, she argues, shows that, while she was not actually in Canada, the Court was able to proceed without her, and ii) an XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 document from the Magistrate's Court, advising the Centre for Social Work in Serbia that \"We are not in a position to forward you data about the residential and financial facts for [the Appellant], and [the reason] is that she lives in Kosovo.\"264\n[149] Fourth, she argues that her testimony corresponds with the country condition evidence, which shows that sex trafficking takes place in Serbia and the Serbian government does not adequately prevent it.\nAppellant's testimony\n[150] Before considering the Appellant's arguments, it is helpful to set out the Appellant's testimony on how her interests were represented in the court proceedings, despite her having been held in captivity:\nRPD: Okay, the reason that I am asking about his for clarification because again I am looking at the court documents from the Appeal Court and the date is XXXX 2011.\nAppellant: I mean I know what the lawyer did.\nRPD: So, you are saying that the lawyer acted without any instruction from you?\nAppellant: I signed the case for the lawyer so that he could deal with my case.\nRPD: And how did the lawyer get paid?\nAppellant: When I was taking the [cooking] course, I was working at the same time and one of my uncles as well living in Switzerland helped me. Because it cost a lot actually, because I had to go ... it is like I had to travel if I can compare like from Toronto to Mississauga, that distance.\nRPD: Okay, what I am trying to understand now is how could you have appealed or have been appealing the court's decision in 2011 when according to you, you were being held captive since 2010?\nAppellant: Because as I mentioned previously the lawyer did everything because in those issues it takes time as it is now and the first trial was in XXXX, the first court sitting.\nRPD: In 2010?\nAppellant: Yes, and when it finished in XXXX, I never dealt with anything.\nRPD: And so, are you telling me that the lawyer proceeded with this appeal without hearing from you?\nAppellant: Yes. Because I had signed for the same case you know.\nRPD: And without receiving further payment from you the lawyer continued to work on your behalf?\nAppellant: I mean he was paid; he was paid what he asked for. I gave him the money that he asked for and that was it.\nRPD: And then there was another appeal in 2012; did you know that?\nAppellant: No.\nRPD: Okay, well the court documents that you gave me indicate that there was another appeal in XXXX 2012.\nAppellant: I do not know what the lawyer did.\nRPD: You do not know what the lawyer did. It is just difficult for me to understand why a lawyer would continue to represent a client that he has not heard from in over two years?\nAppellant: That is how it was.\nRPD: Okay.\nAppellant: I do not know what to say, that is how it was.265\nMy findings on the Appellant's arguments\n[151] Appellant's first argument. Mr. Justice Mosley in paragraph 14 in Santos set out the frequently invoked test from Mr. Justice Muldoon at paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Valtchev case. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Valtchev provide266\n[7] A tribunal may make adverse findings of credibility based on the implausibility of an applicant's story provided the inferences drawn can be reasonably said to exist. However, plausibility findings should be made only in the clearest of cases, i.e., if the facts as presented are outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected, or where the documentary evidence demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner asserted by the claimant. A tribunal must be careful when rendering a decision based on a lack of plausibility because refugee claimants come from diverse cultures, and actions which appear implausible when judged from Canadian standards might be plausible when considered from within the claimant's milieu. [see L. Waldman, Immigration Law and Practice (Markham, ON: Butterworths, 1992) at 8.22]\n[8] In Leung v. M.E.I. (1994), 81 F.T.R. 303 (T.D.), Associate Chief Justice Jerome stated at page 307:\n[14] ...Nevertheless, the Board is under a very clear duty to justify its credibility findings with specific and clear reference to the evidence.\n[15] This duty becomes particularly important in cases such as this one where the Board has based its non-credibility finding on perceived \"implausibilities\" in the claimants' stories rather than on internal inconsistencies and contradictions in their narratives or their demeanour while testifying. Findings of implausibility are inherently subjective assessments which are largely dependant on the individual Board member's perceptions of what constitutes rational behaviour. The appropriateness of a particular finding can therefore only be assessed if the Board's decision clearly identifies all of the facts which form the basis for their conclusions. The Board will therefore err when it fails to refer to relevant evidence which could potentially refute their conclusions of implausibility... [emphasis added by Mr. Justice Muldoon].\n[152] The quoted passage does not stand for the proposition that the RPD was obliged to refer to documentary evidence in support of its finding that the Appellant's claim that court proceedings were being pursued on her behalf at the same time she was being held captive was implausible. The use of the word \"or\" in the passage from Valtchev, quoted above, makes this clear: \"if the facts as presented are outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected, or where the documentary evidence demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner asserted by the claimant.\"267 [emphasis added] The text bolded by Mr. Justice Mosley makes clear that RPD is obliged to set out facts that led it to make its implausibility findings. It did so. That is to say, it found that it was implausible that someone who was kidnapped and held incommunicado would have retained counsel in 2010 (approximately month or two before she was kidnapped) and paid him in advance for his legal efforts in relation to future proceedings (the scope of which was unknown), and that that lawyer would have represented the Appellant's interests, despite not having conferred with her in years.\n[153] Appellant's second argument. As discussed above, I have found above that the power of attorney letter is not admissible at appeal and, as such, will not consider its impact on the RPD's implausibility finding.\n[154] Appellant's third argument. I accept that the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012 Appeal Court decision states that the Appellant was located in Canada with her father and shows that the Court could proceed without her being present. However, whether or not a court could render a decision when one of the parties, who was represented by counsel, was not personally present is not at issue. I accept that it could. I fail to see why the Court's statement may be said to provide evidence that the proceedings were able to take place while she was unavailable for a protracted period of time. The point being made by the Court is not that she has not participated in the lower court process or the appeal process; it is merely a statement-said by the Appellant to be incorrect-that she was in Canada with her father.\n[155] As to the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 document from the Magistrate's Court to the Serbian Center for Social Work, I fail to see how a statement that the Appellant was in Kosovo in the days before XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 makes the Appellant's claims that various court proceedings were pursued on her behalf after she was captured any less unlikely. Whether she was taken captive in XXXX or XXXX 2010,268 nothing turns on whether she was in Kosovo in the time period before the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 letter. If the argument is that, because the authorities proceeded without her being able to provide certain information this shows that the court proceedings could unfold in her absence, this is not convincing. There is no evidence that this is the case. Moreover, the same document states that the document's authors had been in touch with the Appellant in advance of the letter.269\n[156] Appellant's fourth argument. This argument is, in effect, that her claim to have been held captive as a victim of sex trafficking is not implausible because the country condition evidence shows that sex trafficking takes place in Serbia. This does little to advance the Appellant's argument that her claim that court proceedings were pursued on her behalf despite her being held captive is not implausible. The point being made by the RPD was not that her claim to have been held as a victim of sexual slavery was implausible. Rather it was that it was implausible that someone would be held captive and incommunicado for three years, yet litigation on her behalf would have proceeded in the manner it did. As I read the RPD's decision, it would have found her claim to be equally implausible if she had been held incommunicado for three years for any reason-for example, because she was in a coma-but the litigation proceeded nonetheless. That is certainly the basis for my reassessment below.\nMy reassessment of the plausibility of the Appellant's claim that her court proceedings were conducted on her behalf during her captivity\n[157] I note the following elements undermine her claim that XXXX XXXX XXXX represented her for almost a year and half after her disappearance and that she paid him in advance for his services:\n(1) She has not provided evidence as to why she signed the power of attorney on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010-either the month of her abduction or two months before her abduction.270 She does not claim to have known that she would be abducted on her visit to Skopje with her ex-boyfriend. It seems overly fortuitous that she would have decided to grant such an authority when there is no evidence that she had any reason to do so.\n(2) Given that the litigation continued for 16 months after her capture and was not necessarily predictable-e.g., an XXXX 2011 appeal decision ordered that a XXXX 2010 decision be reheard-it is unlikely that the Appellant and her lawyer would have been able to accurately estimate the fees and disbursements associated with it in such a way that she could have paid him in advance.\n(3) While XXXX XXXX XXXX would have had familiarity with her overall wishes, it seems unlikely that he would proceed with a second appeal without obtaining new instructions and consent.\n(4) In order to decide on child support, the courts considered the financial situation of the Appellant-for example, the 2012 Appeal Court decision refers to the Appellant's claim to have no personal property and to the amount of her father's salary.271 While such documents could have been created by her in advance of her capture, it seems likely that the courts would want more recent data, i.e. after XXXX 2010. If the courts did want more recent data, it seems unlikely that XXXX XXXX XXXX would have been able to provide it without communicating with the Appellant.\n(5) Her testimony about whether her parents reported her abduction was unlikely. She testified that she had had no contact with her parents between her capture and XXXX 2013, when she escaped.272 When asked by the RPD at the third sitting-some two years after her release-if her parents filed a missing person's report she replied, \"I have no idea because I have never had a chance to ask them ever.\"273 She testified that when her mother visited her in Canada, she asked her \"about that stuff,\" and her mother started to explain,274 but her sister cut her mother off because \"this thing was not pleasant\" to her sister.275\n(6) Her testimony, which was to the effect that XXXX XXXX XXXX died sometime before approximately XXXX 2014, is inconsistent with the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 obituary for XXXX XXXX XXXX she has requested the admission of as new evidence at appeal.276 In her testimony, she stated that, although she did not know when XXXX XXXX XXXX died, she had called a friend to go to XXXX XXXX XXXX office to get the court documents.277 The friend ended up going to XXXX XXXX XXXX home, where his \"wife gave [the friend] the documents and told her that the lawyer was killed already.\"278 Given that the court documents had been provided to XXXX XXXX XXXX279 in or around XXXX 2014 (and four of the five translated on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014),280 it is clear that XXXX XXXX XXXX must have died some time before XXXX 2014 if the Appellant's testimony is to be believed. The reason the Appellant seeks the admission of XXXX XXXX XXXX obituary at appeal, is to explain her inability to obtain a statement from him confirming that he had acted for her in relation to the court proceedings.281 However, given that the obituary shows XXXX XXXX XXXX death taking place in XXXX 2015, the obituary serves to undermine the credibility of her story about his actions on her behalf.\n[158] Considered individually, the listed elements may not support a finding of implausibility. As the Appellant rightly argues, implausibility findings should only be made in the clearest of cases. Coincidences or fortuitous events do, of course, occur from time-to-time. However, when assessing credibility, the Federal Court has made clear that the Board may look at the narrative as a whole. Several aspects that are irregular or unlikely but do not meet the heightened test of implausibility, may, collectively, lead to such a conclusion. This is such a case.\n[159] The Federal Court's findings in Valtchev do not require the Board to suspend disbelief by ignoring facts or circumstances which a decision-maker, based on common sense and logic, believes to be highly unlikely. In the St. Croix case,282 the RPD rejected the claimant's story based on a number of concerns, including findings that some of her claims were implausible, omissions from her BOC narrative, and the limited supporting evidence she provided. Mr. Justice Norris held:\nThe member's essential finding was \"that the principal claimant's whole story has a sense of not being plausible.\" As set out above, the member identified several discrete elements of the story that led her to this conclusion. The member added that she was \"aware that none of the credibility concerns raised here may be sufficient, each on its own, to negate this claim, but taken cumulatively, they do.\" In my view, this finding was reasonably open to the member on the evidence before her.283\n[160] Mr. Justice Norris's decision in St. Croix was endorsed by Mr. Justice McHaffie in Al Day.284 In that case, he held that the RAD's implausibility analysis was reasonable and in accordance with the Valtchev requirements. He held:\nI agree with the parties that Valtchev does not create a standard of impossibility. In other words, it does not limit implausibility findings to cases where it is impossible that the alleged events occurred. Rather, this Court has equated the \"clearest of cases\" and \"could not have happened\" language from Valtchev to situations where it is \"clearly unlikely\" that the events occurred in the asserted manner, based on common sense or the evidentiary record.... The RAD's distinction between \"implausibility\" and \"impossibility\" is consistent with this Court's jurisprudence and is reasonable.285\n[161] Mr. Justice McHaffie elaborated on the Federal Court's reasoning in Valtchev and held that the \"Valtchev principle...equates to a 'clearly unlikely' standard that helps avoid the fallacy of assuming that evidence of an unlikely event is likely to be false.\"286 Despite this, he stated:\nAt the same time, Valtchev does not preclude consideration of plausibility or likelihood in making credibility assessments. If the evidence shows that a particular occurrence never occurs or is clearly unlikely, this may form a reasonable basis for an adverse credibility finding, particularly if there is nothing to explain or corroborate the clearly unlikely occurrence. Similarly, an assertion may be so far-fetched, so far outside the realm of what could be reasonably expected, even after taking cultural differences into account, that it is implausible, even if the objective evidence does not directly address the likelihood of its occurrence.287\n[162] For the reasons outlined above, I find the Appellant's claim to have instructed and paid her lawyer in advance of her capture, such that he was able to proceed with the litigation connected to the dissolution of her marriage despite being held captive and incommunicado is implausible.\nConclusion on whether there is a serious possibility that the Appellant's ex-boyfriend will harm her on return to Serbia\n[163] Based on my finding that her claim that the legal proceedings in connection with her divorce were pursued on her behalf while she was being held captive and incommunicado, is implausible, combined with the other credibility concerns I have about the Appellant, I find that her ex-boyfriend did not detain her for three years. Consequently, I find that there is not a serious possibility that she will face persecution or other harm at his hands upon return to Serbia.\nPersecution of ethnic Albanians in Serbia\nMy finding\n[164] The Appellant's claim that she would be persecuted on the basis of her status as an ethnic Albanian is limited in nature. She claims that, because of her ethnicity, she could not relocate to certain parts of Serbia where she would be \"marginalized, discriminated against, and otherwise unable to function\" due to her inability to speak Serbian. Moreover, she claims that, while she would not face discrimination were she to live in the parts of the country where the Albanian language was spoken,288 she fears living there because her ex-husband and ex-boyfriend would be able to find her there.289 Given that I have found that the Appellant is not telling the truth when she claims to fear either her ex-husband or her ex-boyfriend, there is no reason, based on the Appellant's own evidence, to find that she may not return to Serbia and live in an area where she will not suffer any disadvantage due to her ethnicity or her inability to speak Serbian.290\nMy alternative finding\n[165] In the alternative, in case my finding that I need not address the Appellant's claim to fear persecution in Serbia due to her Albanian ethnicity because she is able to return to a predominantly Albanian-speaking part of Serbia is incorrect, I will consider her claim of persecution based on her residual profile, i.e. an ethnic Albanian woman who speaks limited Serbian living in Serbia.\nRPD's finding\n[166] The RPD, in rejecting the claim, focussed on the country condition evidence. It noted that, while ethnic Albanians do face discrimination in Serbia, the Serbian government was making serious efforts to protect Albanians, including the condemnation by the Serbian Prime Minister of attacks on the property of Albanians and his statement that ethnic Albanians were Serbian citizens and would be guaranteed full security. It also noted that the Serbian police force included a small number of ethnic Albanians.\nAppellant's arguments\n[167] The Appellant argues that the RPD applied a \"serious efforts\" test, rather than the test of operational adequacy as required by the Federal Court jurisprudence.291 She states that the RPD's reference to the fact the Serbian police force includes a small number of ethnic Albanians does not establish state protection; instead, it is akin the situation in Cervenakova, where Mr. Justice Russell characterized the Board's assessment of a country's progress as amounting \"to a desperate search for any sign of operational adequacy in a generally bleak situation....\"292 She argues that the RPD was selective in its assessment of the country condition evidence.\nMy finding on the Appellant's arguments\n[168] I find that the RPD was rather perfunctory in its treatment of the situation of ethnic Albanians in Serbia. It referred to one or two areas where pro-Albanian statements were made by Serbian officials, noted the participation of some Albanians on the Serbian police force, and concluded state protection was available. I can see how its limited treatment of the issue may appear to the Appellant to have been focussed more on efforts than results, given the fact that it paid so little attention to the country condition evidence and failed to explain why it found state protection to exist in Serbia in practice.\nMy reassessment of the Appellant's risk of persecution\n[169] Consequently, I will re-examine the country condition evidence, paying particular attention to the factors highlighted by the Appellant. She pointed to the following country condition evidence to show the general mistreatment of ethnic Albanians in Serbia.\nRepresentation and confidence in police and government\n* as of 2008, some Albanians had problems with access to education due to a lack of qualified teachers and problems with the recognition of diplomas from abroad;\n* as of 2008, Albanians were underrepresented in national government and public sector employment-though positive steps have been taken by the authorities (concessions on use of language and multiethnic police force in southern Serbia) and there is Albanian representation in municipal government;\n* the 2011 census was boycotted by some 85-90% of Albanians, which \"appears to reflect a certain lack of confidence of the Albanian minority in the central authorities' capacity to improve the overall situation of this minority in Serbia\";\n* in 2013 a legally built monument to Albanian war heroes was destroyed, leading some minorities to perceive government policies as inhibiting the expression of their identities;\n* in March 2014, the then spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior's anti-terrorism unit openly called on football hooligans to use violence to sabotage an event commemorating the 15th anniversary or crimes against Albanians in Kosovo;\n* despite winning a total of ten seats in in the 2016 elections, groups centred on representation by minority communities (including Albanians) had a relatively muted voice in Serbian politics in practice;\n* as of 2016, the steps to minimize the underrepresentation of minorities in police departments had not, according to NGOs, gone far enough; and\n* a 2018 report states that ethnic Albanian leaders in some southern municipalities complained of being underrepresented in state institutions at the local level.\nDiscrimination, racism, and racist attacks\n* a 2008 report refers to assessment that \"the situation for Albanians in Serbia has improved in recent years, but Albanians are 'victims of hidden discrimination and fact high level of intolerance from the majority'\";\n* a 2008 report refers to Albanians being vulnerable to attacks, particularly during the 1999 war, between 2003 and 2005, and in 2008 following Kosovo's declaration of independence;\n* a 2008 report refers to a lack of action to convict perpetrators of violence;\n* a 2013 report states that xenophobia and religious intolerance remain present in 2013 and that \"racist attacks against persons belonging to minorities have occurred\"; and\n* a 2017 report states that hate crime was underreported, that a number of cases were not investigated, and the sentences imposed were considered too lenient.\nLanguage rights\n* a 2010 reform of the justice system aggravated difficulties in access to justice in southern Serbia where the Albanian language is in official use;\n* a 2009 report states that it was not possible to study at the university level in the Albanian language and that the degrees form the University of Pri\u0161tina were no longer officially recognized (but also notes that the Departments of Law and Economics, which provide lectures in Serbian and Albanian, were opened in 2009); and\n* a 2009 report states that Albanians have fewer opportunities in higher education and employment because of the language barrier.\nEconomic participation\n* a 2008 report speaks of the situation improving in recent years, but cautions that Albanians remain excluded from economic participation; and\n* a 2017 report refers to a seemingly high unemployment rate in some areas predominantly inhabited by minorities, including ethnic Albanians.\n[170] I find that the country condition evidence relied on by the Appellant does not present an accurate picture of the current treatment of ethnic Albanians in Serbia for two reasons. First, as is clear from the foregoing summary, much of the evidence dates back to 2008, the year when Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia. This was a particularly difficult time for ethnic Albanians in Serbia293 given that, as noted,294 the Serbian government was against the independence of Kosovo-a region that is made up of over 90% ethnic Albanians.295 Only a minority of the evidence relied upon by the Appellant refers to more recent problems.\n[171] Second, the country condition evidence referred to by the Appellant largely fails to mention the significant progress that Serbia has made in its treatment of ethnic Albanians, in particular in connection with its talks to become part of the European Union. In April 2016, in the context of the process of accession to the EU, Serbia adopted an Action Plan for negotiation relating to the protection and improvement of human rights.296 According to a November 2017 report from the UN Human Rights Council, these improvements have gone beyond the planning stages and become operational:\nCrucial measures aimed at establishing an independent, unbiased, responsible, professional and efficient judiciary are being implemented, as well as measures aimed at prosecuting war crimes, a set of anti-corruption measures, measures banning torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and discrimination, measures for protection of vulnerable groups, protection of rights of national minorities, etc.297\nSeveral other documents in the NDP make clear that Serbia is making actual advances in its protection of human and minority rights.298\n[172] In addition, my review of the country condition evidence generally, and the evidence relied upon by the Appellant in particular, shows that the mistreatment that an ethnic Albanian may be exposed to in Serbia, whether individually or collectively, is not sufficiently grave or repetitive such that the Appellant may be said to face a serious possibility of persecution. The Federal Court of Appeal in Munderere299 considered the definition of persecution, relying on the following passage from the Federal Court in Mete:300\n[I]n Rajudeen v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1984), 55 N.R. 129, the Federal Court of Appeal defined persecution in terms of: to harass or afflict with repeated acts of cruelty or annoyance; to afflict persistently; to afflict or punish because of particular opinions or adherence to a particular creed or mode of worship; a particular course or period of systematic infliction of punishment directed against those holding a particular belief; and persistent injury or annoyance from any source.\n[173] The Federal Court provided the following elaboration in the Hamdan case:301\n[25] As indicated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, 1993 CanLII 105 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689 at paragraph 63:\n\"Persecution\", for example, undefined in the Convention, has been ascribed the meaning of \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\"; see Hathaway, [James Hathaway, The Law of Refugee Status (1991)], 10 at pp. 104-105. So too Goodwin-Gill, [on Goodwin-Gill, Guy S. The Refugee in International Law. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983], at p. 38, observes that \"comprehensive analysis requires the general notion [of persecution] to be related to developments within the broad field of human rights\". This has recently been recognized by the Federal Court of Appeal in the Cheung case.\n[26] The following definition of persecution, used by Justice Heald of the Federal Court of Appeal in Rajudeen v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1984] F.C.J. No. 601 (F.C.A.) (QL), also continues to be applicable (see Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Lin, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1574 (F.C.A.) (QL) at paragraph 18, Prato v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 1345 (T.D.) (QL) at paragraph 7, Mete v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 2005 FC 840 (CanLII), [2005] F.C.J. No. 1050 (T.D.) (QL) at paragraph 4):\nThe first question to be answered is whether the applicant had a fear of persecution. The definition of Convention Refugee in the Immigration Act does not include a definition of \"persecution\". Accordingly, ordinary dictionary definitions may be considered. The Living Webster Encyclopedic Dictionary defines \"persecute\" as:\n\"To harass or afflict with repeated acts of cruelty or annoyance; to afflict persistently, to afflict or punish because of particular opinions or adherence to a particular creed or mode of worship.\"\n[174] As my summary of the country condition evidence shows, the mistreatment experienced by ethnic Albanians tends to be in the nature of discrimination. In some cases, such as where matters may be attributed to language inequalities, it is not even clear that the disparate treatment amounts to discrimination. Racist attacks are not said to be prevalent; rather, they are said to exist.\n[175] Consequently, I find that the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution upon her return to Serbia-even if she were to live in parts of the country where the Albanian language is not predominant.\nState protection\n[176] As the Supreme Court of Canada held in Ward, for treatment to amount to persecution, it must be a \"sustained or systematic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\"302 I have found that the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution upon her return to Serbia; consequently, I have found that no failure of state protection has been shown to exist. In the words of the Federal Court in Olah:303\nThe Applicants argue that the Officer erred in failing to conduct an analysis of the availability of state protection for Roma in Hungary. On this issue, I agree with the Respondent's submission that, where there has been no finding of a risk of persecution, an analysis of state protection is unnecessary. As the Officer did not find that the discrimination in this case rose to persecution, there was no requirement to conduct an analysis of the availability of state protection: see Mallampally v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 267 (CanLII) at para 41.\nCONCLUSION\n[177] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, I confirm the decision of the RPD. The appeal is denied.\n(signed)\nJames Sloan\nJames Sloan\nJanuary 24, 2022\nDate\nANNEX 1: PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nAppellant's arrival in Canada, grant of bail, and change of venue\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: the Appellant entered Canada at the Montreal airport.\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: the Appellant was arrested on suspicion of bringing property into Canada which had been obtained by crime contrary to Article 357 of the Canadian Criminal Code and transferred to a detention facility.\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: the Appellant was deemed a flight risk, arrested, and kept in preventative detention.\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: the Appellant was released on bail.\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: the Appellant retained XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to represent her.\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: XXXX XXXX XXXX made an application to change the location of the RPD proceeding from Montreal to Toronto and applied for an extension of the date by which the Appellant was due to submit her BOC form.\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: the application to extend the time for filing her BOC form was granted.\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: with the assistance of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the Appellant signed her BOC form.\n> XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014: the venue of the proceeding was changed to Toronto.\nThe RPD hearing\n> April 30, 2014: the Minister served a Notice of Intervention on the basis that the Appellant had been arrested and charged with obtaining property by crime.304\n> June 16, 2014, the first sitting of the RPD hearing: during a prehearing conference, the Appellant who was represented by XXXX XXXX XXXX, was designated as a vulnerable person and accommodation was allowed (reverse-order questioning, frequent breaks, and other accommodation as necessary).

In 1991, the Republics of Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Yugoslavia). In 1992, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina followed suit. As a result, \"rump\" Yugoslavia, or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), consisted of the Republics of Serbia (including the province of Kosovo) and Montenegro. In 1998, an ethnic insurgency in the Serbian province of Kosovo led to a Serbian counterinsurgency campaign. NATO bombing led to the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo in June 1999. In 2003, FRY became the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. \"Widespread violence predominantly targeting ethnic Serbs in Kosovo in March 2004 led to more intense calls to address Kosovo's status, and the UN began facilitating status talks in 2006. In June 2006, Montenegro seceded from the [State Union of Serbia and Montenegro] and declared itself an independent nation.... In February 2008, after nearly two years of inconclusive negotiations, Kosovo declared itself independent of Serbia-an action Serbia refuses to recognize.\" In 2013, Serbia and Kosovo signed a first agreement on the principles governing the normalization of relations.

The Appellant states in her BOC narrative she went to stay with her parents in November 2009 (Ibid., Exhibit 2, at p. 17, para 4). I note this apparent discrepancy for the purposes of clarity only; I do not draw a negative credibility finding on this basis.\n11 Ibid., Exhibit 16, at p. 29, para 7.\n12 Ibid., para 8.\n13 According to a March 27, 2012 decision of the Appeal Court of Ni\u0161, the claim was filed on November 26, 2009.

Based on a review of the documents (and their file numbers), it appears that these are all the same court. For the sake of convenience, I will refer to the first-level court in XXXX as the \"Magistrate's Court.\"\n26 The decision is referred to in the XXXX XXXX, 2010 statement from Mr. XXXX, submitted to Magistrate's Court in Vranje (for the Appellate Court in Ni\u0161) as being dated XXXX XXXX, 2010 (Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, at pp. 155-156). It appears, based on the file number (XX\/XX XXXX.No XX\/XX), that the decision of the Magistrate's Court said to have been dated XXXX XXXX, 2010 in the XXXX XXXX, 2010 statement is the same as that referred to by the Appeal Court in Ni\u0161, said to have been dated XXXX XXXX, 2010 (Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibit 6, at p. 138).\n27 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibit 6, at p. 138.\n28 Referred to in ibid., at p. 144.\n29 The decision refers to the wrongful assessment of the level of child support and compensation for martial property (Ibid., at pp. 144-145).\n30 Ibid., at p. 138. Note: the translation at p. 138 refers to a decision from \"21.10.12\"; however, this would appeal to be a translation error, given that the original, at p. 135, refers to \"21.10.2011.\"\n31 Referred to in ibid., at pp. 137-139.\n32 Ibid.

She then testified that she was living with her ex-boyfriend at the time her XXXX course ended in XXXX 2010, and, after a month of living with him, she went to Macedonia. (Ibid. at p. 14).

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 385 (CanLII).\n97 Singh, supra endnote 95, at para 64.\n98 The Federal Court of Appeal reasoned that 110(4) must be interpreted differently than para 113(3)-the provision of the IRPA the Court of Appeal considered in Raza. \"Except for the materiality of evidence, which does not lend itself to the same analysis in an appeal and which subsection 110(6) already considers in determining whether a new hearing should be held, it is not necessary to interpret subsection 110(4) and para 113(a) differently.\" (ibid.) The Court of Appeal described a requirement that new evidence under subsection 110(4) be material as \"redundant,\" because materiality is considered under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, which deals with whether to hold an oral hearing (ibid., at para 48). But cf Yurtsever v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 312 (CanLII), at paras 12-16, where Mr. Justice Bell appears to take the view that the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh also considered materiality to be an essential element to the admission of new evidence under subsection 110(4)-alongside newness, credibility, and relevance.\n99 Rule 29, Refugee Appeal Division Rules, (SOR\/2012-257).\n100 Board Policy on National Documentation Packages in Refugee Determination Proceedings, June 5, 2019 (https:\/\/irb-cisr.gc.ca\/en\/legal-policy\/policies\/Pages\/national-documentation-packages.aspx), at s. 5(II).\n101 While the documents are both dated after the rejection of the claim, they are not, as the Appellant contends, \"new in that they could have been previously provided\" (Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, at p. 268, para 88). They feature information that was in existence before the rejection of the claim (Olori v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 1308; see also Salman v.

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 779 (CanLII), at para 11.\n103 As the Court of Appeal held in Singh, \"[t]he newness criterion may appear somewhat redundant and does not really add to the explicit requirements of subsection 110(4).\" (Singh, supra endnote 95, at para 46).\n104 In Ajaguna v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 556 (CanLII), at para 6, Mr. Justice Barnes held that \"there is nothing inherently illogical or inconsistent when a decision-maker admits new evidence because of its potential to affect the outcome of a case but ultimately finds it to be unreliable when examined closely against other received evidence.\" [underlining in original] Mr. Justice Barnes was addressing a finding in Yurtsever, supra endnote 98, at para 16, where Mr. Justice Bell considered ruled that it was an error for the RAD to find that proposed new evidence was not material after having admitted it: \"because the RAD admitted the new evidence, it must have determined that the evidence could have affected the result-hence, affording it some weight, even if minimal. It follows that the decision is internally inconsistent. One cannot admit new evidence on the basis of its potential impact upon the result, and then declare it to have no weight.\"\n105 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibit 6, at p. 130.\n106 Ibid., at p. 131.\n107 Exhibit P-6, Response to Member's Directions, dated August 13, 2021, at p. 9.\n108 Ibid.\n109 See Wagg v.

Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1993 CarswellNat 3983, 1993 CarswellNat 3984, [1993] A.C.F. No. 598, [1993] F.C.J. No. 598), there may be instances where the Board's failure to mention a document that has particular importance and contradicts its findings may be an error (Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 8667 (FC), at para 17). Because I will have regard to those documents in my reassessment of the RPD's credibility finding, I need not make a finding as to whether the RPD's failure to specifically refer to those documents was an error.\n235 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibit 2, at p. 26, para 11.\n236 The Appellant testified on June 16, 2014 that the BOC documents had been translated to her in (transcript of the RPD hearing, first sitting, at p. 11); on December 5, 2017, she testified that she told her lawyer about her ex-husband being a continuing threat but never read what they wrote (transcript of the RPD hearing, third sitting, at p. 18); and, on February 6, 2018, she testified that she could not recall if 2014 BOC documents had been translated to her (transcript of the RPD hearing, fourth sitting, at p. 10). It was only after the rejection of her claim that she swore she had told Ms. XXXX about the threat from her ex-husband but that the BOC documents had not been translated to her.\n237 Transcript of the RPD hearing, third sitting, at p. 18 and transcript of the RPD hearing, fourth sitting, at pp. 9-10.\n238 Ibid., fourth sitting, at p. 10.\n239 Ibid.\n240 It is true that, in discussing the Appellant's failure to include reference to her husband's abuse in the 2014 BOC documents, the RPD referred to her failure to include reference to domestic violence allegations generally-rather than to allegations of physical abuse. (Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, RPD Reasons, at p. 6, para 13). However, its point there was, as discussed at finding a), a different one.\n241 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibit 16, at pp. 28-29, para 6.\n242 Transcript of the RPD hearing, fourth sitting, at pp. 13-14.\n243 Ibid., second sitting, at p. 31.\n244 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record., Exhibit 6, at pp. 132-133.\n245 Death threats against the Appellant by her ex-husband since her arrival in Canada were not mentioned in the Appellant's 2014 BOC documents, her 2016 amended BOC narrative, or during the first three sitting of her hearing. The November 2017 threats, which she testified about at the fourth sitting in February 2018, were not mentioned at the third sitting in December 2017; they were not mentioned until she was asked by the RPD whether there had been threats against her from her ex-husband since her arrival in Canada.\n246 There is additional medical evidence in the RPD Record, which I have also considered.\n247 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Exhibit 7, at pp 150-152.\n248 Ibid., Exhibit 20, at pp. 433-435.\n249 Ibid., Exhibit 10, at pp 196-200.\n250 Transcript of the RPD hearing, third sitting, at p. 3.\n251 Ibid., fourth sitting, at pp. 25-24.\n252 Abiodun Napoleon v.

This report outlines effective advances Serbia has made in connection with racial discrimination. While the report highlights the country's shortcomings with respect to certain ethnic or national groups, in particular Roma, it makes no mention of mistreatment of ethnic Albanians. A 2017\/2018 report by Amnesty International on human rights in Serbia, makes a single mention the treatment of some ethnic Albanians in Serbia; however, the reference was historic. It relates to the lack of \"progress towards the prosecution of those responsible for the transfer and subsequent burial of bodies of Kosovo Albanians in Serbia in 1999.\" (Ibid., item 2.2, at p. 2).\n299 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The male appellant's record should have been filed by August 9, 2021.\n[3] On August 26, 2021, the RAD dismissed the appellants' appeal on the grounds that the male appellant's record had not been perfected within the prescribed timelines.\n[4] On March 17, 2022, Maria Esposito (the former counsel), presented to the RAD an application to reopen the appeal, along with the male appellant's record. The former counsel states in her sworn affidavit appended to the application to reopen that she was unable to submit the male appellant's record within the prescribed timelines due to health problems, a heavy workload and an issue with sending the documents.\n[5] A copy of the application was sent to the Minister on March 18, 2022. The Minister did not object to the application to reopen.\n[6] The same day, namely March 17, 2022, the RAD received a notice from Rajwinder Singh Bhambi (the counsel) stating that he was the new counsel in the case and that the former counsel's retainer had been revoked.\n[7] On April 12, 2022, the RAD sent the counsel and the appellants a notice giving them the opportunity to make submissions regarding the application to reopen filed by the former counsel on March 17, 2022.\n[8] On April 17, 2022, the counsel sent the RAD his submissions and an additional memorandum. The counsel submits that the former counsel inadequately represented the appellants. The counsel sent copies of the documents to both the Minister and the former counsel on April 17, 2022.\n[9] Neither the Minister nor the former counsel provided responses the day this decision was signed.\nDECISION\n[10] The application to reopen the appeal is allowed.\nAPPLICABLE RULES\n[11] According to rule 49 of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules), an appeal may be reopened only in certain circumstances:\n(6) The Division must not allow the application unless it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice.\n(7) In deciding the application, the Division must consider any relevant factors, including\na. whether the application was made in a timely manner and the justification for any delay; and\nb. if the appellant did not make an application for leave to apply for judicial review or an application for judicial review, the reasons why an application was not made.\n[12] Furthermore, under subrule 49(4) of the RAD Rules, if it is alleged in the application to reopen an appeal that the appellant's counsel \"in the proceedings that are the subject of the application provided inadequate representation,\" a copy of the application must first be provided to the counsel, and the application provided to the RAD must be accompanied by proof that a copy was provided to the counsel.\n[13] Lastly, the person who is the subject of the appeal who is making allegations against counsel to establish inadequate handling of his RAD appeal must comply with the procedure adopted by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada under the Practice Notice - Allegations Against Former Counsel.1\nANALYSIS\n[14] First, it should be noted that this application made by counsel complies with the requirements of the Practice Notice. The RAD did not receive any response to these allegations from either the former counsel or the Minister.\n[15] Second, this application demonstrates both the appellants' diligence in pursuing their appeal and the former counsel's lack of diligence and negligence in the handling of this case. What is more, the former counsel's inaction had the potential to cause substantial prejudice to the appellants and resulted in a significant breach of the principles of natural justice.\n[16] According to the additional submissions presented by counsel, upon receiving the RPD's negative decision on June 23, 2021, the appellants signed a notice of appeal with the help of their former counsel and paid the fees she charged. The former counsel submitted their notice of appeal to the RAD on July 7, 2021.\n[17] The appellants were shocked to learn that their appeal was dismissed on August 26, 2021, for lack of perfection of their record. They contacted their former counsel, who assured them that it was an error on her part. She stated that she had experienced health problems and was overwhelmed with work. She reassured them by telling them that they should not be overly worried because she was going to file an application to reopen along with the appeal record.\n[18] In mid-September 2021, the appellants went to their former counsel's office in Mississauga, Ontario, to discuss-once again-their application to reopen. She reassured them yet again by telling them that the application had been prepared and would soon be submitted to the RAD.\n[19] From September 2021 to March 2022, the appellants were in regular contact with their former counsel to check on the status of their application to reopen the appeal. They submit that, each time, she confirmed to them that the application had been made, along with the appeal record, and that they would now have to wait for the RAD's decision.\n[20] On March 14, 2022, the appellants received a notice from the Canada Border Services Agency requesting that they go to their office on March 24 for an interview ahead of their removal from Canada.\n[21] On March 16, 2022, the appellants met with their former counsel, this time at her office in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec. She then told them that she had filed their application to reopen along with the appeal record on March 9, 2022. They report that she tried to justify the delay in filing their application on the basis of her health problems, as well as being overwhelmed with work and having encountered problems with the documents. She explained to them that she had recruited three individuals to work with her at her practice.\n[22] Dissatisfied, the appellants decided to retain their current counsel on March 17, 2022. The same day, the counsel filed an application with the RAD to find out the status of the case and to confirm that he would now be serving as counsel in this case.\n[23] The RAD did in fact receive the application to reopen along with the appeal record from the appellants' former counsel on March 17, 2022. Upon verification, it appears that on March 9, 2022, the former counsel had sent the application to reopen and the appeal record to the wrong fax number, sending the two documents to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada's Humanitarian Migration office or the pre-removal risk assessment office in Vancouver. This public information is easily accessible online. With no news from the RAD, the former counsel telephoned the RAD registry in Vancouver on March 16, 2022, and was given confirmation that no application had been received. Consequently, the former counsel submitted both the application to reopen and the appeal record on March 17, 2022, this time via Internet.\n[24] It should be noted that the memorandum of appeal presented in support of the application to reopen was signed and dated November 30, 2021.\n[25] On March 24, 2022, the appellants appeared at their pre-removal interview and explained to the officer that they had filed an application to reopen their RAD appeal. He confirmed to them that should their application be dismissed, their removal to India would be imminent.\n[26] On April 12, 2022, after reviewing the application to reopen, the RAD gave the appellants and their counsel the opportunity to make additional submissions regarding the application, which was done on April 17, 2022, in accordance with the Practice Notice.\n[27] Ultimately, the appellants rightly argued that the only reason for which their RAD appeal had not been perfected within the prescribed timelines was due to inadequate representation from their former counsel. This also explains the delay in filing their application to reopen.\n[28] Given the lack of a response from the former counsel, the only explanations she has provided to justify filing the application to reopen on March 17, 2022, are recorded in a sworn affidavit dated March 9, 2022. However, it mentions several justifications and arguments that are inconsistent with the information on the record to explain the delay in filing the application to reopen and the appeal record. Specifically, the former counsel states the following: [translation] \"I have not resolved my problems with refugee files, there are three counsels who will be handling my files. I have also hired a responsible person who started training this week and will start working as of January 31. I can therefore assure you that I will be personally responsible for my portal, and will make sure that everything is filed within the time limits. I should no longer have any delays as of February 1 [2022] [sic].\" As a reminder, this affidavit was signed on March 9, 2022, in a record due on August 9, 2021, and it mentions that all delays will be handled by February 1, 2022. These dates are all inconsistent.\n[29] The former counsel states that she had health problems that she neither established nor explained. This argument cannot be accepted in the context of this case.\n[30] Lastly, the former counsel further notes in this affidavit that she had problems sending the documents that had allegedly been printed a few days earlier. Yet the information on the record clearly shows that the former counsel discovered the problem with respect to sending the application to reopen and the appeal record on March 16, 2022, when she had contacted the RAD registry in Vancouver. This argument is inconsistent with the information on the record.\n[31] In light of the facts above and the evidence on the record, the RAD is of the opinion that the appellants were clearly inadequately represented by their former counsel as she had missed important deadlines that could have resulted in the appellants' removal without their appeal being heard, even though they had the right to it.\n[32] After considering the entire record, the RAD is of the opinion that the appellants have demonstrated that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice since they did not have the opportunity to file an appeal on account of inadequate representation from their former counsel.\n[33] In light of the specific circumstances in this case, the application to reopen was filed in a timely manner.\n[34] The application to reopen the appeal is therefore allowed.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] The application to reopen the appeal of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX is allowed.\n[36] The male appellant's record is deemed to have been perfected.\n(signed)\nKristine Plouffe-Malette\nMe Kristine Plouffe-Malette\nApril 29, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Practice Notice - Allegations Against Former Counsel, September 10, 2018.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : VC1-04668\nVC1-04669\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n7\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

If he returns to the West Bank, he claims to fear physical harm from relatives and community members who view him as an apostate following his conversion to the Roman Catholic faith. He further claims that he cannot return to the UAE since being laid off from his job, as he has lost the related sponsorship required to live there.\n* Impugned Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Decision\n[3] The RPD found that the Appellant had credibly established all material elements as claimed and that a serious possibility of persecution did exist if he returned to the West Bank on account of his religious beliefs. However, it found that only the UAE should be assessed as the Appellant's country of former habitual residence because \"Palestine is not recognized as a country by the Canadian authorities.\" The RPD considered that though the Appellant could no longer return to the UAE, he had not alleged any fear of being persecuted there and, hence, that his claim failed.1\n* Grounds for Appeal\n[4] These RPD conclusions are contested on appeal. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in identifying only the UAE as the country against which protection should be assessed. It is argued that while Palestine is not recognized as a State, Canada does recognize the Palestinian Authority as the government of the OPT. Further, this Board in its section on \"Country of Origin\" information has an entry for the OPT which includes a National Documentation Package (NDP). It is submitted that there were sufficient elements in the NDP to establish the well-foundedness of the Appellant's fear.2\n* Determinative Issues\n[5] The determinative issues in this appeal relate to the Appellant's countries of former habitual residence and his forward-looking risk of persecution in either the OPT or the UAE if he returned.\nBACKGROUND\n[6] The undisputed evidence, which was accepted by the RPD, is as follows:\n[7] The Appellant was born in the city of Nablus, in the West Bank to two stateless Palestinian parents who originate from the town of XXXX XXXX close to Nablus.3 He holds a travel document from the Palestinian Authority4 as well as a temporary travel document issued by Jordanian authorities5 which does not grant any right to residence or nationality in Jordan.6 7\n[8] The Appellant resided in and around Nablus for most of his life, in the area currently known as Zone A - under the control of the Palestinian Authority. He then moved for work as an XXXX XXXX to the city of Dubai, in the UAE from 2008 until XXXX 2019.\n[9] While in the UAE the Appellant became interested in, and converted to, the Roman Catholic faith after being introduced to Christianity by Egyptian Coptic and Lebanese Roman Catholic friends who were living there.\n[10] In 2017, while the Appellant was in the United States (US) for five months to pursue an educational opportunity, his brother found out about his new faith and assaulted him. His brother further cut off his financial support to the Appellant, forcing him to leave the US and return to his previous job in the UAE. He thus returned to the UAE, to his previous employer but was put on notice, in XXXX 2018, that his employment would be terminated due to cuts. He left the UAE in XXXX 2019, after having obtained a US visa and made his way to Canada to seek asylum shortly thereafter.\n[11] He now fears returning to the OPT owing to his family members' view of him as an apostate and ensuing risk of harm in the form of physical violence from them and other community members who were made aware of this, as shown by the documentary evidence tendered.8 He further cannot return to the UAE since being laid off from his job given that he has lost the related sponsorship required to live there.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n* Refugee Appeal Division Role\n[12] The role of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is to intervene when the RPD is wrong in law, in fact, or in fact and law. I reviewed the decision of the RPD by applying the correctness standard.9\n* No New Evidence Has Been Tendered\n[13] The Appellant states in his memorandum that he wishes to submit the NDP relating to the OPT as new evidence with his appeal, however, I note that this specific NDP already formed part of the RPD record and is listed as Exhibit 3 in the RPD's Consolidated List of Documents.10 Further, in accordance with this Board's Policy, I have considered the current version of the NDP in assessing forward-looking risk to the Appellant.11 Thus, it need not be admitted as new evidence here.\n* No New Issues Have Been Raised\n[14] The RPD determined the claim on the issues of absence of a forward-looking risk amounting to persecution for the Appellant in the UAE and found that \"Palestine\" did not constitute a country of former habitual residence for the Appellant on account that it is not recognized as a sovereign State by Canadian authorities. In his Appeal Record, the Appellant argues that these RPD findings are incorrect and that the evidence is sufficient to establish that he faces a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to the OPT and that this is sufficient to make a positive determination on his claim based on the country conditions evidence. In my view, each of the determinative issues in the appeal before me has been raised in the Appeal Record. The Appeal Record was provided to the Minister, pursuant to RAD Rule 3(2). This has given the Minister sufficient notice of the live issues before me in this appeal.\nANALYSIS\n[15] On my own assessment, I agree with the Appellant and find that the RPD incorrectly identified the Appellant's countries of former habitual residence in its reasons (see below - i.). Further, I have examined the evidence on country conditions and consider that there is more than sufficient and credible evidence on the record to support that the Appellant will face a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to the OPT, that state protection would not be forthcoming, and that no viable internal flight alternative (IFA) exists. I can therefore bring finality to the claim (see below - ii.).\ni. The RPD Incorrectly Identified the Appellant's Countries of Former Habitual Residence\n[16] As the Appellant is a stateless Palestinian, he must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in at least one of his countries of former habitual residence and that he cannot return to any other to be successful in his refugee claim.12 Contrary to what the RPD asserts in paragraph 10 of its reasons, it is only necessary to demonstrate that the Appellant would establish a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm in one of his countries of former habitual residence and that he cannot return to the other country or countries of former habitual residence (period). It is not necessary for the Appellant to establish a risk of persecution in each of these countries.13\n[17] Case-law has also established that a country of former habitual residence is considered as such if the Appellant has had a period of significant de facto residence.14\n[18] The Appellant was born in the OPT and also had a work and residency permit in the UAE between 2008 and 2019 when he left. The undisputed evidence is that the Appellant has no entitlement to any nationality.\n[19] Thus, I find that although the RPD had correctly identified the Appellant's countries of former habitual residence as the OPT and the UAE at the hearing15 and included the relevant NDP relating to the OPT in the Consolidated List of Documents16, it later erred in finding - in its reasons - that the OPT could not be considered as such because \"Palestine is not recognized as a country by the Canadian authorities.\"17\n[20] First, from my review of the record, this finding was made in breach of procedural fairness given that the issue of the official status of Palestine was never raised as an issue at the hearing or prior to making the decision - thus preventing the Appellant or his counsel from providing submissions on this point. Instead, at the hearing, a discussion took place with counsel regarding whether the UAE was a secondary country of former habitual residence, and it was clarified by the Appellant that he would not have the possibility to return there today, given that he no longer has the required sponsorship. The RPD accepted this, then asked that counsel provide closing submissions about the risk of persecution for the Appellant in the OPT only.18\n[21] Second, I agree with the arguments put forth by the Appellant regarding the fact that Canada does recognize the Palestinian Authority as the governmental entity in the West Bank and Gaza - this is publicly available information.19 The Appellant has also pointed to the fact that Canada has representation in the city of Ramallah, in the West Bank, currently headed by Ms. Robin Wettlaufer20 and that it interacts directly with the Palestinian Authority and provides aid to it.21 Further, the Appellant points to the fact that this Board itself catalogs documents regarding the Palestinian Authority, listed under Country: Palestinian Territory, Occupied.22\n[22] I find these arguments persuasive and it seems to me that both the Convention and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) refer to a stateless person's country of habitual residence, not a recognized independent State as defined by international law. This is logical in the case of a stateless person who is, by definition, a person without a State. In my view, refugee status determination processes do require, as Justice Grammond has put it, \"assessing the claim in the real world rather than in a hypothetical world.\"23\n[23] This question has already been considered by the Australian Federal Court which, having considered different positions, determined that:\nThere is authority to support the proposition in a certain context that the expression \"country\" can be read as meaning an area or part of the world.24\n[24] And also, that:\nThe objective of the Convention is to provide a practical humanitarian solution to the problems of refugees. It should be interpreted with this objective in mind. Individuals should not be denied the protection of the Convention by an unnecessarily narrow reading of the definition of \"refugee\". It is not appropriate to conclude that an applicant has no recourse under the Convention simply because his or her \"country\" of former habitual residence happens to be a colony or other entity that is not an independent sovereign state.25\n[25] Indeed, I find the RPD's interpretation of what constitutes a country of former habitual residence incompatible with the purpose of the IRPA as set out at s. 3(2)(d): \"to offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\"26\n[26] The Chief Justice in Rosa stressed the importance of the objectives that inform the IRPA, such as granting fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming persecution; offering a safe haven to persons who are able to demonstrate that they are a Convention refugee and establishing fair and efficient procedures that maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system while upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings.27\n[27] In Maarouf, which the Australian Federal Court had also relied upon in the above-cited decision, the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada held that the definition of \"country of former habitual residence\" should not be unduly restrictive so as to pre-empt the provision of \"surrogate\" shelter to a stateless person who has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on any of the grounds enumerated in subsection 2(1) of the Act.28 It noted that this is particularly so because Canada has not ratified the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons29, which renders a stateless claimant who falls outside the Convention refugee definition without recourse in Canada.30 This is still the case today.\n[28] The Supreme Court of Canada has also made clear that the values and principles of customary and conventional international law form part of the context in which Canadian laws are enacted and that to interpret a Canadian law in a way that conflicts with Canada's international obligations risks incursion by the courts in the executive's conduct of foreign affairs and censure under international law - especially where the provision \"has been enacted with a view towards implementing international obligations\".31 This was the case of the IRPA, the refugee protection aspects of which serve principally to discharge Canada's obligations under the Refugee Convention.32\n[29] In fact, if one was to follow the interpretation proposed by the RPD, stateless Palestinians originating from the West Bank or Gaza at risk of persecution would not be covered by the protection of the IRPA or the Convention, as it would never be possible to assess their risk of returning to the OPT. This is despite the reality that these individuals would subsequently be returned there, to persecution - contrary to Canada's international obligations, and to the core customary principle of non-refoulement reiterated in the Refugee Convention and the IRPA.\n[30] The purposive approach is also the one adopted by Refugee Law and Statelessness experts Michelle Foster and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lambert, who argue in their book, International Refugee Law and the Protection of Stateless Persons, that the factual reality is that many stateless persons are stateless precisely because they live in an area controlled by an entity that does not have state recognition and hence is unable to grant nationality. They further argue that the text of the refugee definition in relation to stateless persons, speaks not of \"protection\" of the \"country of former habitual residence\" but merely an inability or unwillingness \"to return to it\", suggesting that a country of former habitual residence need not have the attributes of a state. They conclude that taking into account the protective object and purpose of the Convention, the better view is that country of former habitual residence need not denote a state recognized as such in international law.33\n[31] They also note examples from the French National Asylum Court having considered as a former country of habitual residence the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic because \"the territory has the attributes of a state, such as defined borders, systems of law and a permanent identifiable community\"34 as well as a decision by an Australian tribunal finding that while the OPT is not a State capable of granting nationality, the phrase country of former habitual residence is \"used to denote a country which need not have this capability\".35\n[32] I agree. I find that the OPT fits within the ordinary meaning of the term country and that the territory has the attributes of a state, such as defined borders, systems of law and a permanent identifiable community. As mentioned previously, Canada recognizes the Palestinian Authority as the governmental entity in the West Bank and Gaza.36 Moreover, though residents are subject to the jurisdiction of separate authorities, they are subject to the Palestinian Authority law in the relevant areas, and the Basic Law serves as an interim constitution.37\n[33] The purposive approach also seems to be the one adopted, even if implicitly, by the jurisprudence from this Board and the Canadian Federal Court, which is replete with example of cases where the OPT - whether the West Bank or Gaza - has been assessed as a country of reference.38 What is more, in at least two cases before the Federal Court, it was found that failing to assess Gaza\/the OPT as a country of former habitual residence was an error.39 40\n[34] I have noted only one case from the Federal Court where the official status of the OPT as not a sovereign nation-state was raised, but this argument did not gain traction and was certainly not raised in an attempt to preclude stateless Palestinians originating from the OPT from protection, on the contrary.41 Rather, it was argued by the applicant in that case that the OPT - especially Gaza - are non-contiguous territories in Israel that are precluded from self-governance, military protection, and international relations and, thereby, the country of reference should have been the sovereign state of Israel where Palestinians face daily persecution.42 In that case, however, the applicant originated from Gaza rather than the West Bank. In my view, this is sufficient, on its own, to distinguish the two situations given the significant difference of the realities on the ground - the Palestinian Authority having (some) authority and power to govern in the West Bank - and in particular, the areas known as Zone A - where the Appellant previously resided.43\n[35] Thus, given the purpose and context of the Refugee Convention as outlined above, and the interpretation adopted by its various signatories, it is clear that the OPT can and should be assessed as a country of former habitual residence for a stateless Palestinian seeking Canada's protection.\n[36] Given all the above, I conclude that the RPD erred by refusing to assess the West Bank\/OPT as the Appellant's primary country of former habitual residence. Accordingly, I will now assess the Appellant's situation with regard to his two countries of former habitual residence: the OPT and the UAE.\nii. The Evidence on the Record is Sufficient for the RAD to Bring Finality to the Claim\na) The Appellant has credibly established all material elements of his claim\n[37] The RPD found that the Appellant had credibly established all material elements of his claim, including his conversion and the threats of harm he received from his family members creating a well-founded fear of returning to the OPT.\n[38] Given the Appellant's extensive, detailed, personalized and consistent testimony regarding his growing interest in the Roman Catholic faith while residing in the UAE and his subsequent conversion and resulting threats he faced from family members, as well as his baptism certificate44 and other documentary evidence tendered to support his claims relating to the threats he faces from his family and community45, I agree. I have assessed the forward-looking risk to the Appellant if he returns to the OPT on that basis.\n[39] I further consider that the Appellant has established through his testimony, personal evidence, and the country evidence, his contention that he would be unable to return to the UAE today without the required sponsorship. The copy of his previous UAE residence card shows that it expired in XXXX 201946 and the country evidence confirms that re-entry to the UAE will not be possible based on the previous residency permit.47\n[40] Given the above, it is not necessary for the Appellant to establish a fear of persecution in the UAE in order for his claim to be successful. I will detail below why his fear of persecution throughout the OPT is established.\nb) The evidence is sufficient to establish a forward-looking risk to the Appellant in the OPT\n[41] Having reviewed the totality of the evidence on the record, I find that there is sufficient objective and credible evidence to conclude that the Appellant would face a serious possibility of persecution based on his profile as a convert from Islam to the Roman Catholic faith who is viewed as an apostate and given the threats and physical violence, he faced from family members who oppose his conversion and the evidence tendered in support, showing that members of the XXXX community, more broadly, have declared him as a person \"that deserves death\".48\n[42] I find that his family and other community members would have the motivation to seek and find him if he returned to the OPT today. This is because, the country evidence notes the importance of clans, stating that the clan structure in the OPT is far more consequential than the Bedouin tribes [for example in neighbouring Jordan], and has become even more important since the breakdown of the Palestinian Authority structures during the second uprising, or intifada al-Aqsa, beginning in 2000. It notes that the formal cement that ties together clan members is a mithaq al-sharaf, or code of honour, which is binding on all male members. The mithaq is often a formal written agreement, pages long, that ties together all the disparate families that constitute the hamula. They pledge not only their loyalty to each other but agree that an attack, (physical or honour-based) on one member constitutes an attack on all members of the hamula. Given that Palestinian society shares the honour-shame social system, individual members cannot easily violate this code without dishonouring themselves and their families. It is a powerful social glue, especially in the absence of a functioning state that can provide public security. Absent such a state, the code of vendetta and revenge often becomes dominant.49\nc) The risk to the Appellant exists throughout the OPT\n[43] I further find that this risk of harm to the Appellant extends throughout the West Bank and OPT given that his fear of harm emanates from family members who would eventually become aware of his whereabouts through family contacts and thus would have the means to find him throughout the OPT. Case law is clear that family members or friends should not be expected to put their own lives in danger by denying knowledge of or misleading the agents of persecution as to the Appellant's whereabouts50; he also should not be required to hide from family members and friends in the proposed IFA.51\n[44] Adding to this, country conditions evidence shows that there are severe restrictions on Palestinians' internal and external freedom of movement due to a complex system of bureaucratic, administrative and physical barriers, which include permit requirements, security checks and checkpoints.52 The Appellant cannot simply move to another part of the West Bank - which is already not a large territory. It would require returning to the West Bank and undertaking several administrative processes to access permits, prior to relocating. There is no guarantee that he would obtain said permits.\n[45] According to the UK Home Office, internal relocation between the West Bank and Gaza is likely to be extremely difficult and unreasonable in most cases.53 The UN Human Rights Council further highlights the longstanding restrictions on free movement between Gaza and the West Bank, which includes since 2007 a strict quota system imposed for being allowed to enter or exit Gaza, which was limited to specific categories of persons, such as individuals in need of emergency medical evacuations, medical referral patients, certain businessmen and humanitarian cases. Similarly, a Gaza-based research assistant for Human Rights Watch stated that travel into and out of Gaza is reserved for exceptional cases.54\n[46] It is well established that for a viable IFA to exist, it must be a realistic, attainable option - meaning that the alternative place of safety must be realistically accessible to the Appellant. Any barriers to getting there should be reasonably surmountable. He cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or in staying there.55 I find that the country evidence relating to the various restrictions and permit requirements in place shows, on a balance of probabilities, that internal relocation within the OPT is not a realistically accessible option to the Appellant.\nd) The protection of the Palestinian Authority is not available to the Appellant\n[47] As argued by the Appellant, the Palestinian Authority Basic Law, which serves as an interim constitution, establishes Islam as the official religion and states the principles of sharia shall be the main source of legislation, but provides for freedom of belief, worship, and the performance of religious rites unless they violate public order or morality.56 Country evidence also contains examples of cases where the Palestinian Ministry of the Interior refused to acknowledge the legality of a marriage contracted by a woman who had converted from Islam to the Christian faith - forcing the couple to register their children as born out of wedlock.57\n[48] As mentioned previously, the country evidence shows that clan structure in the OPT has become even more important since the breakdown of the Palestinian Authority structures and that given that Palestinian society shares the honour-shame social system, the code of vendetta and revenge often becomes dominant.58\n[49] In my opinion, given the importance of the clan structure throughout the OPT, the breakdown of the Palestinian Authority structures reported by country evidence - clear and convincing evidence exists that the Appellant, who has violated the basic tenets of Islam given his status as an apostate, would not be in a position to avail himself the protection of the Palestinian Authority against his family's clan and community if he returned to the OPT today.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] In sum, based on the personal evidence adduced by the Appellant and its broad consistency with the documentary evidence, I accept that the Appellant's profile as a stateless Palestinian and Roman Catholic convert, perceived as an apostate by his family and community members in the West Bank, creates a serious possibility of persecution on account of his religion and membership in a particular social group (individuals contravening social and religious mores) if he returns to the OPT today.\n[51] It is important to remember that the Appellant is not required to establish that this risk exists beyond a reasonable doubt or even on a balance of probabilities, but rather that there exists \"more than a mere possibility\"59 that he would face persecution from his family or community members anywhere in the OPT, and I find that he has established this in light of the country evidence.\n[52] Given all the above, I consider that the Appellant has established that he will face a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to the OPT, that adequate state protection is not available to him, and that no viable IFA exists. He has also established that he is unable to return to the UAE, given that he has lost any right to work or reside there.\nDECISION\n[53] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention Refugee.\n(signed)\nxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxx\nFebruary 25, 2022\nDate\n1 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, RPD Reasons, paras. 16-35.\n2 Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, Appellant's Memorandum, pp. 15-21.\n3 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Schedule A, p. 62.\n4 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Palestinian Authority Travel Document, p. 148.\n5 Exhibit RPD-1, RPD Record, Jordanian Travel Document, p. 147.\n6 Exhibit RAD-1, National Documentation Package (NDP), Jordan, 17 December 2021, tab 3.8: ?Palestine and Jordan: Passports issued to stateless Palestinians by the government of Jordan, including procedures, entitlements, differences between Jordanian passports issued to Jordanian nationals and those issued to stateless Palestinians...

He alleges that he is at risk of criminal acts by assailants who had previously targeted him for extortion, and also that his appearance of wealth as a former businessman constitutes an additional risk of harm under subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n* Conclusions of the Refugee Protection Division:\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellant's claim and concluded that he had failed to establish a prospective risk, other than a generalized risk in the context of rampant criminality, as a person who appears wealthy.2\n* Grounds of appeal:\n[4] The appellant is appealing the RPD's conclusions.3 His arguments can be summarized as follows:\n* The RPD erred in concluding, on the one hand, that the appellant was personally subjected to a risk related to rampant criminality but, on the other hand, that this is a widespread phenomenon in Haiti, which is completely inconsistent with the interpretation of subsection 97(1) provided by case law. He argues that the RPD did not correctly describe the nature of the risk the appellant faces and the degree of the risk in relation to that faced by the entire Haitian population.\n* He is allegedly perceived as a wealthy businessman and also relies on documentary evidence that middle-class and affluent Haitians have a higher individual risk of victimization by criminals in Haiti than their lower-income compatriots.\n* Notice of new issues raised on appeal:\n[5] In accordance with the Federal Court's recent decision in Alazar,4 the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) gave notice both to the appellants and the Minister that new issues would be considered on appeal regarding the additional prospective risk for the appellant given the recent situation in his home district of Fontamara, state protection, and the internal flight alternative (IFA) in Haiti. This notice provided an opportunity to make submissions on these issues.5 Written submissions were provided as a response from the appellant in the form of a supplementary memorandum on the issue of the IFA,6 and I have considered them in this decision.\n* Determinative issues:\n[6] The determinative issues before the RAD are the prospective risk for the appellant if he were to return today, state protection, and whether there is a viable IFA elsewhere in Haiti.\nBACKGROUND\n[7] The appellant was a business owner in Port-au-Prince. Should he return, he states that he fears two individuals who had threatened him with extortion at his home in XXXX 2017, knowing that he owned a business and had money. He gave them the money he had on him, but they promised to return for the rest of the money demanded. Then, the appellant allegedly took some precautions and did not always come home after work, and he did not see them again. He then left for the United States in XXXX 2017, and he moved his family to the Croix-des-Bouquets commune, into the home of his (now deceased) mother-in-law.\n[8] His wife, who remained in Croix-des-Bouquets, was also allegedly threatened in a violent incident while he was away from XXXXto XXXX 2017, but the appellant does not know their identities or whether they are linked to his XXXX 2017 attackers. He then returned to Haiti in late XXXX 2017, and he decided to close his business in XXXX 2018.7 On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, the appellant received a telephone call from an unidentified individual asking him where he was and warning him that he would be [translation] \"crushed\" if he ever returned to Fontamara.8 His wife also reportedly received telephone calls from strangers requesting information about the appellant following his final departure to the United States in XXXX 2018.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n[9] The standard of review in this appeal is the standard of correctness.9 I conducted an independent review of the evidence, including the recording of the RPD hearing and the appellant's record.\nANALYSIS\n[10] For the reasons set out below, I do not agree with the RPD's conclusions regarding the appellant's prospective risk, and I consider that the appellant has established a personalized risk of which the nature and degree is different from that faced by the rest of the Haitian population given his profile, past experiences and the current situation in the Fontamara district where he is from (i). I will therefore also determine the appropriate remedies (ii).\ni. The Refugee Protection Division erred in its analysis of prospective risk\n[11] Regarding the violent assault against the appellant in XXXX 2017 and the subsequent threats against him and his family, the RPD correctly found that the appellant was credible regarding his past experiences. In light of the appellant's spontaneous, coherent and personalized testimony, I agree. I also consider that all of the facts as alleged have been established as presented.\n[12] However, the RPD considered that, following the XXXX 2017 incident, the appellant did not directly receive any other threats or see the two individuals who assaulted him again until his departure from Haiti to the United States in XXXX 2017. The RPD concluded that this demonstrated their lack of motivation to further pursue the appellant and that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that his risk was different from that generally faced by other Haitian citizens because he was returning from abroad and would be perceived as a businessman given the rampant criminality affecting the entire population.\n[13] The appellant argues in his memorandum that the RPD erred in simultaneously concluding that the appellant is personally subjected to a risk related to rampant criminality, but also that this is a widespread phenomenon in Haiti, which is completely inconsistent with the interpretation of subsection 97(1) provided by case law. He argues that the RPD did not correctly describe the nature of the risk the appellant faces and the degree of the risk in relation to that faced by the entire Haitian population. I agree, and I will explain.\na) Analysis framework for reviewing refugee protection claims under paragraph 97(1)(b)\n[14] The analysis framework for reviewing refugee protection claims under paragraph 97(1)(b) was discussed comprehensively by my RAD colleagues in the recent cases TC1-0503810 and VB8-06039;11 the second decision was in fact designated a decision of interest for refugee appeals in November 2021.\n[15] In both of these decisions, my colleagues refer to the decision of Justice de Montigny (now of the Federal Court of Appeal), confirming the established consensus as to the proper approach to be followed for the notion of general risk within the meaning of subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA.12 He refers to Justice Gleeson's decision in Portillo,13 cited frequently, which states that it is necessary to first define the nature of the risk encountered by the applicant, and then compare the described risk faced by the refugee protection claimant to that faced by a significant group in the country to determine whether the risks are of the same nature and degree. If the risk is different, then the claimant will be entitled to protection under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.14\n[16] Moreover, as stated repeatedly by the Federal Court, Justice de Montigny reiterates that the mere fact that the risk stems from criminality and that it affects a significant segment of the general population, does not, in and of itself, put an end to the required inquiry under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.15\nb) The Refugee Protection Division erred in its analysis of the appellant's prospective risk\n[17] I am of the opinion that the RPD did indeed forgo the aforementioned analysis framework because this risk stems from criminality and affects a significant segment of the general population. I therefore consider this to be an error.\n[18] Based on my independent review of the evidence, I note that RPD did not sufficiently consider the telephone calls made to the appellant and his family in 2018, which, on the one hand warned him that he would be \"crushed\" if he ever returned to Fontamara and, on the other hand, showed the ongoing interest of individuals who contacted his wife requesting information about the appellant following his final departure to the United States in XXXX 2018. While the appellant cannot provide irrefutable evidence connecting these individuals with those who assaulted him in 2017, I consider his reasoning to be logical and rational, especially given Haiti's sociocultural context where rumours are rife and are an effective way of locating people because \"Haitians tend to be geographically tied to a small area and so anyone outside of their [usual] circle will be quickly recognized.\"16 I therefore consider this nexus has been established, on a balance of probabilities.\n[19] Moreover, the appellant's counsel made some highly relevant submissions before the RPD, including the fact that the appellant was targeted at his home, not at his business in Port-au-Prince, but that they alluded to his business and the fact that he was wealthy, which demonstrates that his assailants were watching him and were aware of his movements and routines. I am of the opinion that this does indeed demonstrate that the assailants had a special interest and intimate knowledge of the appellant, and that it was not a random, unpremeditated attack.\n[20] The appellant also argues in his memorandum that the RPD did not correctly examine his risk profile under paragraph 97(1)(b) of IRPA as a (former) businessman who is perceived as wealthy or who has access to money, and also relies on documentary evidence indicating that middle-class and affluent Haitians have a higher individual risk of victimization by criminals in Haiti than do their lower-income compatriots.17\n[21] I find these arguments persuasive.\n[22] I note that the crime rate in Haiti is high and that nearly all population groups are targeted.18 However, while all Haitians risk being affected by crime, this Board's documentary evidence also confirms that small business owners could also be personally targeted by crime, including by gangs,19 and that the place of residence is also a factor in the risk level, especially in certain zones in and around Port-au-Prince where violence is very present, and it is the perfect territory for gangs to work in, \"as the police officers cannot fully penetrate into these zones.\"20\n[23] I am also of the view that the fact that people continued to contact the appellant's family even though they had moved to the Croix-des-Bouquets commune demonstrates a real and sustained interest in finding the appellant and targeting him personally. This supports the appellant's claim that his risk-which can be qualified as a risk to his life given the threats against him that he would be \"crushed\" if he returned to Fontamara-is, on the one hand, personal and, on the other hand, different from the risk faced by the rest of the Haitian population given his profile, his past experiences, the genuine interest his agents of harm have in finding him since his departure, as well as the current situation in the Fontamara district where he is from.21\n[24] In particular, it has been reported that control of the Fontamara-Cit\u00e9 Soleil artery is seen as strategic for electoral purposes, and that gang leaders seek to expand their spheres of influence by driving out anti-authority gang leaders and appointing loyal followers in their place.22 In September 2021, armed individuals took back control of the area of Fontamara and Martissant. Vehicles that tried to cross Fontamara and Martissant were stopped and used to obstruct the road. Since L\u00e9on Charles became the head of the Haitian National Police, the situation of insecurity in the metropolitan area has worsened. The gangs have multiplied and established themselves in their respective neighbourhoods without any concern. The rare instances of police intervention were unsuccessful. As of this past June 1, the gangs of Grand Ravine and Village-de-Dieu have been controlling anything that moves in Martissant, and they closed the area's police substation without any resistance. Several hundred local residents were left behind and forced to leave their homes to take refuge in shelters and elsewhere.23\n[25] While the gang violence currently prevailing in Fontamara and surrounding areas such as Matissant is not, on its own, a situation that would allow for access to protection under paragraph 97(1)(b), there is no doubt that the pervasiveness of armed groups in the area where he resides and where other residents perceive him as a wealthy man further increases and adds to the already established risk of being personally targeted by his previous assailants who have already targeted him for this very reason.\nc) Conclusion on the appellant's prospective risk\n[26] In short, given the facts in this particular case, the appellant's past experiences confirming that he was monitored and personally targeted, and given the very precarious and volatile situation in the Fontamara area where he is from, I am of the opinion that the evidence shows that the appellant would face a personal risk that also differs from the generalized risk faced by the entire or a large part of the Haitian population.\n[27] Furthermore, I consider that the pervasiveness of gangs and the high rate of violence in his area of origin, where he is known and perceived as a wealthy man, further worsen the risk level, which was already higher than average.\nii. Determination of remedies\n[28] Having concluded that the RPD erred in its analysis, I must now examine how to remedy this.\na) The appellant has established a prospective risk that meets the criteria of subsection 97(1)\n[29] Based on the objective evidence and the appellant's particular circumstances, I have concluded that he would be subjected to a risk to his life in Haiti, and that other people in Haiti do not generally face the same risk.\nb) State protection is inadequate\n[30] There is clear and convincing objective documentary evidence demonstrating that there is no adequate protection in Port-au-Prince or in Haiti.24 The documentary evidence reports that Haiti's police force is too small given the crime rate and that it lacks resources and means. It mentions that \"[d]oubts have been repeatedly raised as to whether the national police force is able to guarantee the security needed to protect citizens, enforce the law and promote political stability.\"25\n[31] In a general context of faltering security and political structures, as well as the lack of resources to address the high crime rate throughout the country, I am of the opinion that it has been established that adequate state protection is not available to the appellant in Haiti.\nc) There is no internal flight alternative\n[32] Considering the size of the country, the documentary evidence shows that truly motivated criminals would be able to find their targets anywhere in Haiti, given the effectiveness of word of mouth and rumours. The documentary evidence gives an example of a case where criminal gangs were allegedly able to find their target within a few minutes using these mechanisms.26\n[33] Given the repeated efforts to inquire about the appellant's presence in Haiti following his departure, I am of the opinion that the motivation of the agents of harm to locate him has been established on a balance of probabilities.\n[34] Furthermore, given the current situation in Haiti and the control of the major roads, especially the one to Fontamara (see para. 24), I am of the opinion that the IFA is not a \"realistic, attainable\" option that is \"realistically accessible\"27 to the appellant, given that criminal gangs control the major roads linking Port-au-Prince to the other regions of the country.28\n[35] Lastly, given the current conditions of insecurity in Haiti,29 and the fact that there is a lack of adequate state protection throughout the country, I am of the view that there is no IFA for the appellant anywhere in Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] I am of the opinion that the appellant would be personally subjected to a risk to his life in Haiti, and that other people in Haiti do not generally face the same risk. I am also of the view that the state protection is not adequate and that there is no viable IFA.\nDECISION\n[37] I set aside the RPD's determination. I substitute the RPD's determination with my own determination that the appellant is a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nJanuary 28, 2022\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 SAR-1, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Haiti, November 30, 2021, Tab 4.16: Le Moniteur.
