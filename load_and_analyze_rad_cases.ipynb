    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Data Source: Immigration and Refugee Board. In the Fall of 2022, the IRB added the Refugee Law Laboratory to their email distribution list for legal publishers of RAD decisions. The RLL therefore receives new RAD cases as they are released for publication by the IRB. Also, in the fall of 2022 the Immigration and Refugee Board provided the RLL with a full backlog of approximately 116k published decisions from all divisions (RAD, RPD, ID, IAD). \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Unofficial Data: The data are unofficial reproductions. For official versions, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Non-Affiliation / Endorsement: The data has been collected and reproduced without any affiliation or endorsement from the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Non-Commerical Use: As indicated in the license, data may be used for non-commercial use (with attribution) only. For commercial use, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. \n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Accuracy: Data was collected and processed programmatically for the purposes of academic research. While we make best efforts to ensure accuracy, data gathering of this kind inevitably involves errors. As such the data should be viewed as preliminary information aimed to prompt further research and discussion, rather than as definitive information.\n",

      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] This is the redetermination of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), rejecting the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant), a citizen of Nigeria. These are my reasons for allowing the appeal.\n",
      "[2] The Appellant and her son XXXX fear persecution from the Appellant's husband's family because of her son's XXXX. By decision dated August 13, 2018, the RPD rejected the claim of the Appellant and her son, finding they lacked credibility. By decision dated May 14, 2019, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) found the RPD erred in its credibility assessment, found the son to be a Convention refugee, but denied the Appellant's appeal finding that there was no evidence of a forward-looking risk for the Appellant. By decision dated February 19, 2020, the Federal Court granted the Appellant's application for judicial review and returned the matter back to a differently constituted RAD for a redetermination of the RPD decision. The Federal Court found that the first RAD panel overlooked significant and material evidence related to a forward-looking fear and erred by considering the Appellant's risk independently of her son.\n",
      "[3] My role is to consider all the documents before me and determine if the RPD made the correct decision vis a vis the Appellant. In coming to my decision, I have taken into account the RPD Record, the Appellants' Record,1 the Appellant's Supplementary Record,2 including the Application for New Evidence,3 as well as the Chairperson Guidelines 4.4 In addition, I am guided by Mr. Justice Dinar's decision allowing the Appellant's Application for Judicial Review.5\n",
      "[4] Having carried out an independent assessment of all the evidence, I find the RPD erred in its analysis of the evidence and its negative credibility findings. I find the Appellant has demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, a serious possibility of persecution and a forward-looking fear of persecution from the Appellant's husband's family if she returns to Nigeria. I find the Appellant is a Convention refugee.6\n",
      "NEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\n",
      "Application for new evidence at the first appeal to the RAD\n",
      "[5] The Appellant sought to admit new evidence under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act ( IRPA) in its first appeal to the RAD.7 I have considered the application.\n",
      "[6] The Appellant seeks to admit copies of her and her son's Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.8 I reject the admission of these documents. The BOCs, along with amendments, already form part of the RPD Record.9 As a result, it is not necessary to admit them.\n",
      "[7] The Appellant also seeks to admit a copy of the transcript of the RPD hearing.10 It is not necessary to admit the transcript, as I have received and reviewed an official transcript of the RPD audio recording.11\n",
      "[8] The Appellant also seeks to admit a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.12 It confirms that the Appellant's son has been diagnosed with XXXX. The letter postdates the RPD hearing. The Appellant has not offered any explanation for why the letter was not submitted prior to the rejection of her claim. I therefore reject the admission of this document. I note, however, that I accept that the Appellant's son is XXXX.\n",
      "[9] As I am not accepting any new evidence, I do not have discretion to hold a hearing under subsection 110(6) of IRPA.\n",
      "Application for new evidence at the RAD redetermination\n",
      "[10] The Appellant seeks to admit three affidavits as new evidence on this redetermination.13 I find these documents are all dated after the RPD rejection of the Appellant's claim.14 In addition, I find the three documents meet the requirements established by the Raza and Singh cases. 15\n",
      "[11] Affidavit of the Appellant and exhibits, sworn XXXX XXXX XXXX 202016 - The Appellant's affidavit is dated after the RPD rejection and provides information concerning events that happened in Nigeria after the rejection of her claim. Exhibit A to the affidavit is a letter from the school attended by the Appellant's children who remain in Nigeria. The letter describes attempted abductions of the children at their school in XXXXand XXXX 2019 by the Appellant's husband's family. Exhibit B is a photograph of the Appellant's brother with his leg in a cast, along with a letter from the hospital confirming his injury. I find the affidavit and the attached exhibits are from credible sources. The Appellant's affidavit is properly sworn. Exhibit A, on its face, is a letter from the XXXX XXXX School, with contact information and Exhibit B is a letter from Federal Medical Centre. In addition, the documents provide new information that is relevant to issues in this appeal, specifically whether the Appellant's husband's family are still interested in the Appellant and her family. I allow admission of the affidavit and attached exhibits.\n",
      "[12] Affidavit of the Appellant's husband, sworn XXXX XXXX XXXX 202017 - The husband's affidavit provides evidence of the attempted abductions of the Appellant's children by his family and states that the wife will not be safe if she comes back to Nigeria. It corroborates the information provided by the letter from the children's school. It is a duly sworn affidavit, which I find to be authentic. It is evidence relating to events that happened post-rejection and it is relevant to an issue in this appeal, namely the motivation of the agents of persecution to find the Appellant. I allow the admission of the affidavit.\n",
      "[13] Affidavit of the Appellant's brother, sworn XXXX XXXX XXXX 202018 - I allow the admission, in part, of the brother's affidavit.\n",
      "[14] The brother's affidavit refers to three attacks on him by the husband's family, where they asked for the brother to produce the Appellant and her son for spiritual cleansing. I allow the admission of paragraphs 1 to 3 and paragraphs 12 to 24, which provide evidence of contact between the Appellant's husband's family and her brother in Abeokuta after the rejection of the Appellant's claim. The affidavit appears to be duly sworn, with authentic identification. It provides new evidence that is relevant to the issues in this appeal, namely the motivation of the agents of persecution to find the Appellant.\n",
      "[15] I reject the admission of paragraphs 4 to 9 of the brother's affidavit as they refer to an attack that occurred prior to the rejection of the Appellant's claim. I note that the Appellant's brother submitted an affidavit which refers to this same attack that is already part of the RPD Record.19 I have considered that affidavit in my assessment of the RPD Record.\n",
      "[16] The Appellant has requested an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA20. I reject the application for an oral hearing. I find the that the information is relevant but not central to my decision on this appeal.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "The RPD erred in its negative credibility finding\n",
      "[17] The RPD rejected the Appellant and her son's claim after making negative credibility findings. The RPD focused on the omission in the Schedule A Background /Declaration form of the address where the Appellant fled to; the plausibility or lack thereof, of the husband's family having the motivation to kill the son; the Appellant's delay in obtaining a passport for the son; and the delay in filing an asylum claim in the United States of America (U.S.A.).\n",
      "[18] In its decision allowing the son's claim, but rejecting the Appellant's claim, the first RAD overturned all four of the RPD's negative credibility findings. I agree with the first RAD's rationale for overturning the negative credibility findings.\n",
      "Omission in Schedule A\n",
      "[19] In relation to the omission of the friend's address in the Schedule A Background/ Declaration form, the Appellant testified that she did not include that address as she did not consider it to be a residence. Instead, it was a hiding place. Schedule A requests information on all the places the applicant lived. It does not call for the applicant to list any and all places they have stayed in since the 18th birthday or the past 10 years. I find the Appellant is credible when she said that she considered this a hiding place she stayed in, and not a place she lived. I find this to be a reasonable explanation.\n",
      "Implausibility of the husband's family having the motivation to locate the Appellant and her son\n",
      "[20] The RPD made what amounts to an implausibility finding that the Appellant's husband's family lacked motivation. Findings of implausibility must be based on the evidence and be made in the clearest of cases.21 I find the RPD failed to consider evidence before it that contradicts this finding. Both the husband's and the friend's affidavits22 provide supporting evidence that is overall consistent with the Appellant's testimony that the husband's family were motivated and did make attempts to find the Appellant and her son.\n",
      "[21] In addition, I find the RPD was wrong to find that the husband's family's actions were implausible because the Appellant was not able to explain why the husband's family took no action against the Appellant and her son for three years.23 I find it reasonable that the Appellant cannot explain why the husband's family wanted to kill her son, but delayed in taking any action. She is not able to explain what was in their minds.\n",
      "[22] I find the Appellant has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the husband's family have the motivation to find her and her son.\n",
      "Delay in obtain a passport for the Appellant's son\n",
      "[23] The RPD had credibility concerns because of the Appellant's delay to obtain a passport for her son. I agree with the Appellant that the RPD concerns are based on the member's idea or speculation of what the member thought the Appellant should have done, and not based on any direct or objective evidence. I find the delay to obtain a passport has little relevance to the question of whether the Appellant has demonstrated a subjective fear for herself and her son at the hands of the in-laws.\n",
      "Delay in claiming in the U.S.A.\n",
      "[24] The RPD also had concerns regarding the Appellant's failure to claim protection in the U.S.A. While a delay in claiming asylum can raise credibility concerns, I find the Appellant's explanation for why she did not file a refugee claim in the U.S.A is reasonable. The RPD indicated that it would be reasonable to expect that the Appellant would contact a lawyer or make enquiries about making an asylum claim when she was in Maryland. The Appellant explained that she and her son arrived in Maryland in winter and did not go to the mosque; she was always at home and she did not know anyone. She explained to the member that she talked with her host in Maryland about making a claim, but her host told her that they could not seek asylum in the U.S.A. I find the Appellant has reasonably explained why she did not file a claim in Maryland.\n",
      "[25] When the Appellant and her son moved to Indianapolis, she received assistance from a mosque and a social worker for her son and received a work permit. In addition, they were in the U.S.A. lawfully. I find these factors also explain why she did not claim in the U.S.A. I draw no negative credibility inference from the failure to claim.\n",
      "[26] Having carried out my own assessment of the Appellant's evidence, supporting and objective documentation, I find that she has provided sufficient, credible evidence to indicate that she has a well-founded fear of persecution from the husband's family because of her membership in a particular social group, namely a mother of a child with XXXX who has been threatened with ritual killing.\n",
      "The Appellant has demonstrated a forward-looking fear of persecution\n",
      "[27] The Appellant submits that she has demonstrated a forward-looking fear of persecution. For the reasons above, I agree with the Appellant. I find the RPD erred in failing to consider whether the Appellant faces a future risk of harm in Nigeria. Based on my review of the RPD Record and the new evidence I have admitted, I find the Appellant has established, on a balance of probabilities, a forward-looking fear of persecution from the agents of persecution if she is returned to Nigeria.\n",
      "[28] Supporting evidence before the RPD indicates that the husband's family members were willing to use force to and coercion to find the Appellant and her son. For example, the friend of the Appellant deposed that two men sent by the husband's family came to her house where the Appellant and her son were hiding. They demanded that she hand over the Appellant and her son.24 The Appellant's friend further stated that one week later, she was detained by the Nigerian police and questioned about the Appellant's whereabouts,25 which indicates that the husband's family have connections with the police. In addition, she indicated that the in-laws have not stopped searching for the Appellant and her son in order to force the rituals on them.26\n",
      "[29] The Appellant's husband confirms that in addition to looking for the son to inflict significant harm on him, his family is also interested in locating the Appellant. He states that the family wish to force the Appellant to go through rituals separately from her son.27\n",
      "[30] The RPD gave the Appellant's husband's affidavit little weight because it did not address what the family members planned to do with the Appellant and her son prior to XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, and because the husband was not present at the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 family meeting.28 The RPD failed to make any finding on a key allegation in the husband's affidavit, namely that the Appellant would be forced to go through rituals separately from her son. I find this allegation credible.\n",
      "[31] In addition, I find the RPD failed to consider the affidavits from the Appellant's brother and her friend in its assessment of the evidence. The affidavit from the Appellant's friend confirms that the Appellant fled to the friend's house in XXXX 2015. It confirms that children who are developmentally delayed are tormented and ostracized by the community and family and many are killed. The friend states that two men from the husband's family came to her house looking for the Appellant and her son, demanding that she hand the Appellant over. The friend goes on to explain that a week later she was detained by the Nigerian police and asked about the Appellant's whereabouts.29\n",
      "[32] The Appellant's brother indicates in his affidavit that he was beaten by thugs and police when the chief of the husband's family came to his house looking for the Appellant.30\n",
      "[33] I have reviewed the three affidavits and find nothing that leads me to question their authenticity. I find the three affidavits provide credible support to the Appellant's allegation that the agents of persecution have threatened her directly, and that they have detained and harmed persons who may know her whereabouts.\n",
      "[34] In addition, I have considered the new evidence I have admitted. The letter from the Nigerian school for the Appellant's two children who remain in Nigeria provides evidence that the husband's family remain interested in the Appellant's family. The letter indicates that the head of the husband's family came to the school with four other men and tried to abduct the two children.31\n",
      "[35] The affidavit from the Appellant's brother provides further evidence that the husband's family remains interested in the Appellant and her son. He states that the chief of the husband's family came with six thugs to his compound. The brother injured his leg during his escape.32\n",
      "[36] According to Maldonado:\n",
      "When an applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.33\n",
      "When I apply the Maldonado principle to the evidence in this case, I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the Appellant's allegations. Furthermore, I find that the supporting documentation presented, provides credible corroboration for her claim.\n",
      "[37] Having carried out an independent assessment, I find the Appellant has established, on a balance of probabilities, a forward-looking fear of persecution.\n",
      "State protection\n",
      "[38] The Appellant's narrative, testimony and supporting documentation indicate that she and her husband did report the agents of persecution to the police as well as the Imam of their mosque, but were told that as it was a family matter, these authorities would not get involved. In addition, the evidence indicates that the chief of the husband's family is able to enlist police to assist him in locating the Appellant and her son. In these circumstances, I find it unlikely that Appellant would benefit from police protection if she returned to Nigeria.\n",
      "Internal flight alternative\n",
      "[39] I have considered the viability of an internal flight alternative (IFA) for the Appellant were she to return to her country. I find that she has no objectively reasonable IFA. The Appellant is a mother of an XXXX child who has been found to be a refugee in Canada. The evidence indicates that she would not return to Nigeria alone and leave her child in Canada without anyone to take care of him.\n",
      "[40] There is no absolute right for family members' refugee claims to be processed together or to share the same, positive outcome.34 However, in this case, the claims of the mother and son are, as noted by the Federal Court, \"inextricably bound together.\" They hid together, they fled together, and the agents of persecution continue to search for both of them together. Given the Appellant's particular circumstances, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for her to return to Nigeria and relocate to any other place with or without her son.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[41] The appeal is allowed. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the IRPA, I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n",

      "[1] Il s'agit de l'appel prÃ©sentÃ© par madame XXXX XXXX et son Ã©poux, monsieur XXXX XXXX, citoyens d'HaÃ¯ti, relativement Ã  une dÃ©cision de la Section de la protection des rÃ©fugiÃ©s (SPR) rendue le 2 avril 2019, ayant rejetÃ© leur demande d'asile.\n",
      "[2] Le rÃ©cit soumis au formulaire de Fondement de la demande d'asile (FDA) est Ã  l'effet que monsieur XXXX, l'appelant au dossier, affirme qu'il a travaillÃ© entre 2007 et 2017 comme directeur XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Il indique que le XXXX Ã©lu en 2016 l'Ã©tait sous la banniÃ¨re du parti politique XXXX XXXX XXXX tandis qu'il favorisait le parti \" RÃ©ponse paysanne \". Il ajoute que le XXXX le persÃ©cutait grÃ¢ce Ã  l'aide de bandits Ã  sa solde; ceci dans le but de le faire dÃ©missionner.\n",
      "[3] Il signale que le XXXX XXXX 2016, le XXXX lui a transmis une lettre pour l'expulser de la XXXX et que le XXXX XXXX 2016, des bandits ont tirÃ© des coups de feu et des pierres sur sa maison, brisant une fenÃªtre et causant un choc Ã  la tÃªte de sa mÃ¨re, qui a entraÃ®nÃ© sa mort. L'appelant indique que le XXXX XXXX 2017, lors d'une manifestation, des bandits l'ont agressÃ© Ã  coups de pieds et ont brÃ»lÃ© son vÃ©hicule. Le XXXX XXXX 2017, il dit avoir Ã©tÃ© battu par des bandits qui l'ont suivi jusqu'Ã  Port-au-Prince. L'appelant soumet aussi avoir Ã©tÃ© l'objet Ã  plusieurs reprises de menaces de mort, avoir dÃ©mÃ©nagÃ© Ã  plusieurs reprises et avoir fait appel Ã  la police, mais en vain, car il s'agissait d'une affaire politique. Il signale que le XXXX XXXX 2017, il a reÃ§u une lettre de congÃ©diement de son poste de directeur XXXX. Il a par la suite fait des dÃ©marches pour Ãªtre dÃ©dommagÃ©, aprÃ¨s quoi il a reÃ§u des menaces Ã  l'effet que des bandits allaient incendier sa maison avec sa famille Ã  l'intÃ©rieur. Les appelants quittent alors pour le Canada le XXXX XXXX 2017, transitent par les Ã‰tats-Unis et ils indiqueront leur intention de revendiquer la protection du Canada le 8 janvier 2018, selon les documents au dossier.\n",
      "[4] La SPR a rejetÃ© leur demande d'asile en raison d'un manque de crÃ©dibilitÃ©, considÃ©rant les nombreuses omissions dans les formulaires dÃ©posÃ©s.\n",
      "[5] En appel, les appelants soumettent les arguments suivants :\n",
      "1. Est-ce que la SPR a fondÃ© sa dÃ©cision sur une conclusion de fait erronÃ©e, tirÃ©e de faÃ§on arbitraire et capricieuse;\n",
      "2. Est-ce que la SPR a errÃ© en ne considÃ©rant pas toute la preuve prÃ©sentÃ©e devant elle.\n",
      "[6] MalgrÃ© les omissions notÃ©es par la SPR, les appelants allÃ¨guent que le tribunal a errÃ© en concluant qu'ils n'Ã©taient pas crÃ©dibles et en raison de leur comportement en lien avec la crainte.\n",
      "[7] Les appelants demandent Ã  la Section d'appel des rÃ©fugiÃ©s (SAR) d'accueillir l'appel, d'infirmer la dÃ©cision rendue par la Commission et de renvoyer les dossiers des appelants Ã  la SPR pour un nouvel examen.\n",
      "[8] Les appelants ne demandent pas Ã  prÃ©senter un nouvel Ã©lÃ©ment de preuve en vertu du paragraphe 110(4) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des rÃ©fugiÃ©s (LIPR)1 et ils ne dÃ©sirent pas la tenue d'une audience en vertu du paragraphe 110(6) de la LIPR \"\n",
      "[9] Le reprÃ©sentant du ministre n'est pas intervenu en appel.\n",
      "DÃ‰CISION\n",
      "[10] En vert du paragraphe 111(1) de la LIPR, la SAR confirme la dÃ©cision attaquÃ©e, Ã  savoir que XXXX XXXX et XXXX XXXX n'ont pas la qualitÃ© de \" rÃ©fugiÃ© au sens de la Convention \", ni celle de \" personne Ã  protÃ©ger \" au sens des articles 97 et 97 de la LIPR.\n",
      "[11] L'appel est rejetÃ©.\n",
      "PORTÃ‰E DE L'APPEL\n",
      "[12] Pour des questions de fait et de droit ainsi que des questions mixtes de fait et de droit, la SAR doit appliquer la norme de la dÃ©cision correcte conformÃ©ment Ã  l'arrÃªt Huruglica2.\n",
      "[13] J'ai procÃ©dÃ© Ã  une analyse indÃ©pendante de l'ensemble de la preuve au dossier, aprÃ¨s avoir fait une Ã©coute attentive de l'audience, afin de me faire ma propre opinion au sujet de cette demande d'asile et de dÃ©terminer si la dÃ©cision rendue par la SPR est correcte.\n",
      "ANALYSE\n",
      "[14] AprÃ¨s avoir pris connaissance de l'ensemble de la preuve au dossier, tant testimoniale que documentaire, la SAR en vient Ã  une conclusion identique Ã  celle rendue par la SPR, selon laquelle les appelants ne sont pas crÃ©dibles.\n",
      "[15] Les appelants sont d'avis que la SPR a fait dÃ©faut d'Ã©valuer adÃ©quatement leur crÃ©dibilitÃ©, et que cette incidence sur la dÃ©cision va dans la direction que les appelants ne seraient pas persÃ©cutÃ©s dans leur pays de nationalitÃ©.\n",
      "[16] L'essence mÃªme de ce dossier repose sur la crÃ©dibilitÃ©.\n",
      "[17] Le premier Ã©lÃ©ment soulevÃ© au mÃ©moire consiste Ã  affirmer que la SPR a fondÃ© sa dÃ©cision sur des conclusions de faits erronÃ©es et les appelants ajoutent tirÃ©es de faÃ§on arbitraire et capricieuse. Selon les appelants, le fait d'omettre certaines informations n'est pas fatal Ã  la demande. La SPR a conclu que les appelants n'Ã©taient pas crÃ©dibles en regard de leur tÃ©moignage et de leur comportement. Qu'en est-il au sujet du tÃ©moignage livrÃ©?\n",
      "[18] PrÃ©cisons au dÃ©part que monsieur XXXX a tÃ©moignÃ© en trÃ¨s grande partie, considÃ©rant que c'est lui le principal intÃ©ressÃ© dans l'affaire. AprÃ¨s avoir confirmÃ© que leur formulaire de renseignements personnels Ã©tait complet, conforme, exact et Ã  jour, l'appelant a mentionnÃ© craindre de mourir et que sa crainte remonte au premier XXXX 2016.\n",
      "[19] InterrogÃ© au sujet de l'Ã©vÃ©nement survenu le XXXX XXXX 2016, l'appelant de rÃ©pondre que vers minuit, une heure du matin, des individus sont venus Ã  leur rÃ©sidence. La famille a entendu des bruits Ã  l'extÃ©rieur et ils se sont enfuis Ã  la dÃ©robÃ©e par la porte arriÃ¨re. InvitÃ© Ã  relater ce qui s'est passÃ© Ã  ce moment, l'appelant de rÃ©pondre que les bandits \" ont tirÃ© en l'air pour ne pas rÃ©veiller le voisinage \". Il ajouta que des slogans Ã©taient relayÃ©s pas les truands dans la forme suivante : si vous ne voulez pas laisser XXXX XXXX en bon terme, sinon cela serait en mauvais terme. L'appelant a tÃ©moignÃ© avec dÃ©tails sur l'incident du XXXX XXXX 2016.\n",
      "[20] Il a ajoutÃ© que sa mÃ¨re malade est demeurÃ©e sur place et que les bandits ont cassÃ© les fenÃªtres, jetÃ© des pierres sur la maison, etc. L'appelant revient Ã  la maison accompagnÃ© du juge de paix, afin de constater les dÃ©gÃ¢ts suite au passage des individus. Dans le rapport des autoritÃ©s ou si l'on prÃ©fÃ¨re, le procÃ¨s-verbal, on ne fait mention des slogans racontÃ©s par ces personnes. ConsidÃ©rant que les individus viennent menacer directement l'appelant afin que ce dernier quitte XXXX XXXX, il est Ã©tonnant que le contenu du texte ne fasse rÃ©fÃ©rence qu'Ã  des bris physiques et non au cÅ“ur des intentions du groupe, soit le dÃ©part de l'appelant de ses fonctions. Pour toute rÃ©ponse au premier tribunal, l'appelant de tÃ©moigner : je ne fais pas trop attention Ã  cela pour mettre au rapport.\n",
      "[21] Un peu plus loin dans l'audience, l'appelant a ajoutÃ© un Ã©lÃ©ment qui dÃ©tonne beaucoup. Il relate ne pas avoir indiquÃ© les slogans dans ces documents car \" je ne l'ai pas dit, je me suis pas tout rappelÃ©, c'est au fur et Ã  mesure qu'on parle \".\n",
      "[22] La SAR ne peut accepter de telles explications afin d'Ã©tayer un moment phare dans le rÃ©cit parcouru de l'appelant. Depuis l'Ã©lection du nouveau XXXX et de son Ã©quipe, des tiraillements existent avec l'appelant car il soutient que les individus ne sont pas issus de la mÃªme famille politique et que le nouveau XXXX veut que l'appelant quitte son poste pour favoriser son fils qui prendrait la relÃ¨ve. Les explications de l'appelant en regard de l'Ã©vÃ©nement du XXXX XXXX 2016 sont beaucoup plus prÃ©cises et directes que celles contenues au rÃ©cit et dans le rapport des autoritÃ©s. La SAR est d'avis que ces informations auraient dÃ» Ãªtre colligÃ©es dans les documents et ensuite expliquÃ©es en cours d'audience. Ã€ lire le rÃ©cit soumis, on pourrait dÃ©duire que des manifestants veulent s'en prendre Ã  la famille pour des raisons financiÃ¨res. Toutefois, le tÃ©moignage Ã  ce sujet est bien diffÃ©rent. L'appelant explique que les manifestants sont Ã  la solde du XXXX, qu'ils viennent s'en prendre Ã  ce dernier et que l'Ã©dile utilise des fiers-Ã -bras pour inciter ce dernier Ã  quitter son emploi. Les slogans entendus sont pour le moins directs et non Ã©quivoques. Ces informations pertinentes ne se retrouvent pas dans le rÃ©cit et le rapport du juge de paix. Pas un seul endroit, mais deux textes ne comportent pas ces informations importantes. Les explications au sujet de ces omissions ne tiennent pas la route. Le fait de dire qu'il ne voulait pas mentionner certaines choses et que par la suite, il affirme que ces informations lui reviennent, il ne s'est pas tout rappelÃ© et que c'est au fur et mesure qu'on parle; ne peuvent Ãªtre retenues. C'est une personne Ã©duquÃ©e qui dÃ©tient un poste important XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, soit directeur XXXX et ce dernier, dans son rÃ©cit manuscrit, n'ait pas songÃ© Ã  mentionner ces informations d'envergure et de consÃ©quence ne peut que nuire Ã  sa crÃ©dibilitÃ©. C'est la base, le nÅ“ud gordien de la crainte de l'appelant et ces renseignements ne sont pas colligÃ©s dans les textes.\n",
      "[23] Ã€ ce sujet, la SAR est d'avis que la SPR n'a pas errÃ©.\n",
      "[24] Un Ã©lÃ©ment connexe mentionnÃ© au mÃ©moire, traitÃ© ci-haut, concerne l'omission dans la plainte d'Ã©lÃ©ments importants, s'explique par le fait que l'appelant se mÃ©fiait des autoritÃ©s policiÃ¨res. La SAR a bien Ã©coutÃ© l'enregistrement de l'audience. Nous n'avons pas notÃ© cet Ã©lÃ©ment au cours du tÃ©moignage. Au contraire, l'appelant, de par sa situation de directeur XXXX, au fait de XXXX XXXX XXXX, a de son propre chef requis la venue des autoritÃ©s afin de constater les dÃ©gÃ¢ts dans sa rÃ©sidence. Le rapport (piÃ¨ce D-13) relate ce que le juge de paix a constatÃ© dans la rÃ©sidence familiale de l'appelant. Nous n'agrÃ©ons pas Ã  l'affirmation contenue au mÃ©moire.\n",
      "[25] Un autre sujet abordÃ© au mÃ©moire concerne l'omission des Ã©vÃ©nements survenus XXXX XXXX. Les appelants soutiennent que ce n'est pas un Ã©vÃ©nement important au dossier. Quant Ã  la SPR, elle constate l'omission, soit une rencontre avec un bandit.\n",
      "[26] Le tÃ©moignage de l'appelant est Ã  l'effet qu'il a dÃ©mÃ©nagÃ© XXXX XXXX aprÃ¨s l'incident du XXXX XXXX 2016. Il y serait demeurÃ© environ un an. Il ajoute avoir demeurÃ© Ã  plusieurs endroits mais que XXXX XXXX fut une ville oÃ¹ il a habitÃ©. L'appelant fut interrogÃ© en regard de son dÃ©part de cette ville. Il a rÃ©pondu : Ã§a va se savoir et me reconnaÃ®tre. Il ajouta ceci : un des bandits m'a vu et il m'a fait un geste et je savais qu'il m'avait retrouvÃ©. PriÃ© d'expliquer cette omission au rÃ©cit Ã  l'effet qu'un bandit l'avait reconnu dans la ville XXXX XXXX, la rÃ©ponse fut surprenante. Il a fait part au tribunal qu'il n'a pas prÃªtÃ© attention Ã  cela et que s'il avait tout relatÃ© dans les dÃ©tails, cela aurait Ã©tÃ© trop volumineux.\n",
      "[27] Force est de constater que le rÃ©cit manuscrit est d'une longueur relative de quelques feuillets. Ce qui est dÃ©plorable dans ce dossier, c'est de nombreux Ã©vÃ©nements que la SAR juge pertinents sont absents du rÃ©cit alors qu'ils auraient dÃ» se trouver dans l'histoire. Pour reprendre les explications de l'appelant Ã  savoir s'il avait relatÃ© dans les dÃ©tails, le sujet amenÃ© en cours d'audience n'est pas anodin. Un bandit le reconnaÃ®t et lui fait un geste signifiant qu'il Ã©tait retrouvÃ© et pistÃ©. La SAR est d'avis qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un dÃ©tail en regard de cet Ã©lÃ©ment et que cette information aurait dÃ» Ãªtre mentionnÃ©e au rÃ©cit, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Cela nuit grandement Ã  sa crÃ©dibilitÃ©.\n",
      "[28] Les appelants mentionnent au mÃ©moire que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de l'ensemble de la preuve et ignorÃ© l'Ã©vÃ©nement marquant comme l'incident du XXXX XXXX 2017 dans la capitale. La SAR a mÃ©ticuleusement pris des notes au sujet de cet Ã©vÃ©nement. Qu'a dit l'appelant au sujet de l'incident du XXXX XXXX 2017? Il tÃ©moigne avoir rencontrÃ© un groupe de personnes. Il soutient avoir Ã©tÃ© retrouvÃ©. Ã€ cette occasion, il aurait reÃ§u des coups de pieds et de poings. Surgis un gros bruit, selon ses dires, et les gens de la zone sont venus. La police est appelÃ©e et les individus se sont enfuis.\n",
      "[29] InvitÃ© Ã  donner des dÃ©tails sur l'Ã©vÃ©nement et les individus prÃ©sents, l'appelant de raconter que les individus avaient le visage cachÃ© qu'il ne peut les reconnaÃ®tre mais il affirme que ces personnes le surveillaient car elles connaissaient son horaire. La SAR a de la difficultÃ© Ã  Ã©tablir le syllogisme entre des individus masquÃ©s, le surveillant et connaissant son horaire de dÃ©placement. Comment peut-il faire un amalgame entre une Ã©chauffourÃ©e et des individus Ã  la solde du XXXX XXXX qu'il ne peut reconnaÃ®tre alors qu'il se trouve dans la capitale. La SAR est d'avis que cet Ã©lÃ©ment aurait pu faire l'objet d'un paragraphe dans la dÃ©cision de la SPR, mais considÃ©rant les autres Ã©lÃ©ments que la SAR juge essentiels et qui n'ont pas Ã©tÃ© rapportÃ©s par l'appelant dans son rÃ©cit, ce dernier point est mineur.\n",
      "[30] L'appelant a dÃ©clarÃ© craindre la nouvelle administration depuis son Ã©lection en XXXX 2016. Selon ses propos, le nouveau XXXX dÃ©sire chasser l'appelant de son poste qu'il occupe depuis 2007 afin d'y asseoir son fils. Il a rapportÃ© avoir eu des ennuis de toutes sortes avec le XXXX. MalgrÃ© ces embuches, ces menaces pour le moins explicites, selon l'appelant, ce dernier continue Ã  travailler dans son poste. Il souligne exÃ©cuter ses tÃ¢ches quelques jours par semaine. Suite Ã  la lettre de congÃ©diement (piÃ¨ce D-10) - qui est pour le moins curieusement rÃ©digÃ©e- l'appelant fera des dÃ©marches auprÃ¨s des XXXX XXXX pour rÃ©cupÃ©rer son poste. Il a relatÃ© plusieurs Ã©vÃ©nements qui s'apparentent Ã  des menaces directes de le voir disparaÃ®tre, mais l'appelant poursuivra son travail jusqu'Ã  son dÃ©part du pays en XXXX 2017.\n",
      "[31] La SAR est d'avis que les dÃ©marches entreprises par l'appelant pour demeurer en poste au XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, le fait qu'il vienne donner une prestation de service \" timidement \", comme il l'a rappelÃ©, Ã  quelques reprises pour la population est incompatible avec la crainte subjective qu'une personne peut ressentir.\n",
      "[32] En consÃ©quence, la SAR est d'avis que la SPR n'a pas errÃ©.\n",
      "[33] Pour les motifs exprimÃ©s dans cette dÃ©cision, la SAR est d'avis que la SPR a rendu une dÃ©cision correcte et celle qui s'imposait.\n",
      "RECOURS\n",
      "[34] Pour ces motifs, la SAR confirme la dÃ©cision de la SPR, soit que madame XXXX XXXX et monsieur XXXX XXXX n'ont pas la qualitÃ© de \" rÃ©fugiÃ© au sens de la Convention \" en vertu de l'article 96 de la LIPR, ni la qualitÃ© de \" personne Ã  protÃ©ger \" au sens de l'article 97 de la mÃªme Loi.\n",

      "[2] L'appel est rejetÃ© pour dÃ©faut de compÃ©tence, car il porte sur une demande d'asile qui a Ã©tÃ© dÃ©fÃ©rÃ©e Ã  la SPR avant l'entrÃ©e en vigueur de l'article 36 de la Loi sur des mesures de rÃ©forme Ã©quitables concernant les rÃ©fugiÃ©s (LMRER) dans sa version modifiÃ©e par la Loi visant Ã  protÃ©ger le systÃ¨me d'immigration du Canada (LVPSIC).

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "[1] Mr. XXXX, you are a citizen of Chad, you presented evidence before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD),1 and you stated that you fear persecution by the Chadian authorities as a member of the Gorane ethnic group who participated in a demonstration on XXXX XXXX, 2017.2\n",
      "[2] The RPD rejected your claim for refugee protection, finding that your allegations in relation to your arrest and the fact that the Chadian authorities are looking for you are not credible. It also found that you did not establish that you had been subjected to persecution in the past or had a well-found fear of persecution in the future as a member of the Gorane ethnic group.3\n",
      "[3] On appeal, you provided documents4 and submitted that the RPD erred in rejecting your claim for refugee protection. First, you claim that it did not comply with the principles of procedural fairness owing to issues relating to the interpretation of your testimony. Next, you allege that the RPD erred in its assessment of your credibility. Lastly, you claim that the RPD has not considered your profile as a member of the Gorane ethnic group who is perceived as a political opponent.5\n",
      "[4] I conclude that some of the documents you provided on appeal are admissible (I), but that there is insufficient grounds to hold a hearing (II). After analyzing all the evidence, I determine that your appeal must be allowed, and that your danger of being subjected to torture if you return to Chad has been established (III).\n",
      "[5] In the following paragraphs, I will explain how I arrived at these conclusions.\n",
      "I. EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n",
      "[6] On appeal, you presented a series of documents:\n",
      "* a psychological report;\n",
      "* letters from various people living in Chad; and\n",
      "* documents concerning the current conditions in Chad.\n",
      "[7] I find that some of these documents are admissible and that others are not, under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and the relevant case law.6\n",
      "Psychological report\n",
      "[8] An expert report must be examined by the RAD and the RPD in the same way, taking into account the expert's qualifications, the detailed nature of the analysis, the information that the refugee protection claimant provided to them, the length of time that the expert spent with the refugee protection claimant, and the question of whether the report is an inadmissible recommendation that goes beyond the author's field of expertise.7\n",
      "[9] The requirements of reliability and relevance are not simply decided by the rules of technical evidence. They are the basis that decision-makers use to decide whether to give probative value to the information available for analysis.8 The Federal Court recently identified elements that are among the factors to be considered when examining the reliability of an expert report, one of which is the methodology used by the expert to formulate their opinion, their field of expertise and the extent to which they are found to be impartial and objective.9\n",
      "[10] A section of a report which goes beyond the author's expertise and defends the interests of the refugee protection claimant is neither reliable nor relevant with respect to the primary findings under the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal in question.10\n",
      "[11] Both the RAD and the RPD must take into account the refugee protection claimant's medical condition, and a medical or psychological report would allow them to consider whether the refugee protection claimant's physical or psychological health could affect their behaviour during the hearing.11 It would be erroneous to make findings regarding the credibility of a refugee protection claimant without having taken into account their psychological assessment, for example.12 However, when it is based on a discredited story, a report provided by a psychologist, anthropologist or other expert cannot rehabilitate the refugee protection claimant's story.13\n",
      "[12] In short, an expert report cannot, by itself, establish the credibility of a refugee protection claimant's allegations.14 In other words, an expert report cannot be used as a tool for evaluating whether a refugee protection claimant's account is truthful. Furthermore, Guideline 8 is very clear in this regard:\n",
      "8.4 Experts should not offer opinions on issues within the exclusive jurisdiction of the decision-maker, such as the merits of the person's case.\n",
      "8.5 An expert's opinion is not in itself proof of the truthfulness of the information upon which it is based. The weight given to the report will depend on, among other things, the credibility of the underlying facts in support of the allegation of vulnerability.15\n",
      "[13] In her report, the psychologist states that she completed the evaluation in a few hours by using a list of questions aimed at verifying the severity of your depression. She identified the results regarding your depression, the corresponding symptoms and the importance of consulting a psychiatrist who could prescribe appropriate medication for you.16 I find that this section of the report does not analyze your health at the time of your RPD hearing and that, as a result, it cannot be used as an explanation as to why, at certain points, you had difficulty giving your testimony. Moreover, after listening to the recording of the RPD hearing, I find that you were able to provide your testimony in a coherent manner, for the most part, though there were times when you did not understand the questions put to you by the RPD. With regard to your current medical condition, since you did not testify at a hearing before me, your medical condition could not have affected your behaviour during such a hearing. Consequently, the evidence provided in this section of the psychological report is not admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n",
      "[14] With regard to the section of the report concerning the events that you and your family experienced, I find that the information provided is not evidence of events that occurred after your claim for refugee protection was rejected. Consequently, this evidence is not admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n",
      "Letters from various people living in Chad\n",
      "[15] The letters that you provided on appeal contain information that arose after your claim for refugee protection was rejected.17 For example, your former spouse stated that, on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, 2019, she witnessed agents from the national security agency (ANS) visit the family home. Your cousin, mother and two neighbours stated that they witnessed the ANS agents' visits to the family home and that the last visit was in XXXX 2019. An employee of a company that offers check-in and boarding services at the airport where travellers enter or leave your country stated, in his letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2019, that your name appears on a list requiring the company to inform the authorities of your arrival in the country. The president of a human rights association stated that, on XXXX XXXX, 2019, your father and mother informed him that they had been the victims of persecution and that, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, one of your cousins had informed him of threats that he had received from the military.\n",
      "[16] In my opinion, these letters contain evidence that arose after your claim for refugee protection was rejected and are admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n",
      "Documents concerning the conditions in Chad\n",
      "[17] The documents concerning the current conditions in Chad18 refer to evidence included in the latest version of the National Documentation Package on Chad.19 However, these documents are not new evidence within the meaning of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and are not admissible.\n",
      "II. ORAL HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n",
      "[18] I found that the evidence presented on appeal that was deemed admissible raised serious issues with respect to your credibility, but that it is not central to the decision with respect to your refugee protection claim, and that this evidence alone cannot justify allowing your claim for refugee protection. Consequently, the three conditions necessary for holding a new hearing under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA have not been met.\n",
      "III. ANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\n",
      "[19] I conducted my own analysis of the record, primarily by listening to the recording of the hearing held before the RPD.20 I concluded that the correctness standard of review must be applied.21 In my opinion, the risk that you would be exposed to torture if you returned to Chad is the determinative issue. Consequently, I will limit my analysis to this issue alone.\n",
      "[20] Based on my own analysis of the record, the RPD erred in finding that your testimony was vague and included substantial contradictions with your Basis of Claim Form and prior statements.\n",
      "[21] I find that you gave coherent testimony on the essential elements of your claim for refugee protection. I identified no omissions or substantial contradictions.\n",
      "[22] As your counsel noted in her submissions before the RPD, you have clearly demonstrated that you are a member of the Gorane ethnic group and that you were arrested during a student protest when you were looking for your brother. He was also arrested. He subsequently went missing and, according to the information obtained by your family, apparently died during his detention.22\n",
      "[23] Based on my own analysis of the record, your testimony regarding the treatment you were subjected to following your arrest also appeared to be consistent, the doubts expressed by the RPD during the hearing having been resolved, particularly concerning the question of whether or not you were struck on the back while your head was held underwater.23\n",
      "[24] During the hearing, the RPD asked several questions based on the information provided in the documentary evidence. The RPD pointed out that your personal profile did not correspond to that of persons who, based on this documentary evidence, are targeted by the Chadian authorities.24 In my opinion, your claim for refugee protection should not have been analyzed in this way. While it is true that the documentary evidence suggests that certain categories of persons are generally targeted by the Chadian authorities, this does not necessarily mean that your testimony on your personal situation is not credible.\n",
      "[25] Moreover, the evidence that you provided on appeal establishes that the Chadian authorities are currently looking for you.\n",
      "[26] The documentary evidence indicates that the security forces in your country are not adequately monitored by the civil authorities, and that these security forces are corrupt, arbitrarily detain people, and engage in extortion and torture. The documentary evidence also indicates that impunity is rampant in your country since the judges, many of whom are corrupt, are overburdened and subject to executive interference.25\n",
      "[27] In this context, I am of the opinion that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, that you would risk being subjected to torture if you returned to Chad, that the Chadian authorities would provide you with no protection, and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[28] For these reasons, I set aside the RPD's determination and substitute the determination that, in my opinion, should have been made, namely, that you are a person in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA.\n",
      "[29] Your appeal is allowed.\n",

      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the father, Principal Appellant (PA) and Designated Representative) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the mother and Second Appellant (SA)), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the children and Minor Appellants), citizens of Nigeria, appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated July 19, 2019, rejecting their claims for refugee protection.\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[2] The appeal is dismissed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "Allegations\n",
      "[3] The PA began working with his father and uncle at his father's XXXX in XXXX 2011. His father became sick at the hands of his uncle using black magic. In XXXX 2012, the PA was abducted and beaten by men who warned him to never return to the XXXX. Months later he went to his uncle's home to try to make peace with him. The uncle threatened him and he became unconscious, which he later learned was due to his uncle using black magic. In XXXX 2014, he travelled to the United States (U.S); his wife, the SA, and children stayed behind. Shortly after he left Nigeria, men broke into their home and the SA was sexually assaulted. In XXXX 2017, after the SA was followed in her car, she and the Minor Appellants travelled to the U.S. The SA filed a claim for refugee status in the U.S., however, the PA did not. In January 2018, the family crossed into Canada seeking asylum.\n",
      "[4] On arrival in Canada, the PA's identity was questioned. He was subsequently detained for a period of time before being released on conditions.\n",
      "RPD Decision\n",
      "[5] The RPD concluded that the PA's identity had been sufficiently established. In respect of their allegations, the RPD found neither the PA or the SA to be credible. It noted material omissions by the PA in interviews with Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and found that he had failed to claim asylum in the U.S. The RPD concluded that their delay in leaving Nigeria was inconsistent with the alleged fear.\n",
      "Grounds of Appeal\n",
      "[6] The Appellants argue the RPD erred by not accepting reasonable explanations offered by the Appellants and failed to adequately assess supporting documentation, including medical reports.\n",
      "[7] With respect to the SA, they argue that the RPD erred in its application of the Chairperson's Guidelines on Gender. Finally, they argue the RPD failed to assess the separate risk to the SA and her daughter in relation to the prevalence of sexual assault in Nigeria.\n",
      "ROLE OF THE RAD\n",
      "[8] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it.1 The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in the assessment and weighing of oral testimony heard, which, in particular cases, attracts a standard of review of reasonableness.2 Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[9] I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and arguments. This review includes listening to the entire recording of the hearing. Further, I have considered and applied the Chairperson's Guideline 3 and 4.3\n",
      "[10] In my view, the RPD erred by determining that the letters from family, friends and neighbors lacked probative value as they did not testify at the hearing. Nonetheless, I have concluded that the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellants were not credible and that they failed to establish their allegations on a balance of probabilities.\n",
      "[11] The determinative issues are credibility, delay and the PA's failure to seek asylum in the US.\n",
      "The PA did not identify risk of fear in his interviews with CBSA\n",
      "[12] The RPD found that the PA made material ommissions that were not reasonably explained in two interviews with CBSA after arriving to Canada and during his detention. The interviews occurred on February 1 and 7, 2018. In both interviews, he was asked why he left Nigeria. He indicated that there is no work, no hope and no future for his family.4\n",
      "[13] At the hearing, he was asked why there was no mention of his fear of his uncle in the interview on February 1:\n",
      "\"A. (PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT): I said at the time of the interview, we had just arrived at Canada then. And the previous 72 hours, I hardly have any sleep. Then, so I was too tired so exhausted and also, I try as much as possible then to answer the question as much as I'm supposed to do. But I didn't because I think I misunderstood the questions. But I thought it was just a, it was a situation of we have to answer the question in a general way so that's what I did and also, I also thought probably it was a situation where I have to -... Given complication of my story so probably I have to sit down later be able to write the story properly and that is what I did later on and that is what I'm sticking with today.\"5\n",
      "[14] The RPD then reviewed his answer in the second interview on February 7. The PA responded:\n",
      "\"A. (PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT): I was in depression; I mean I was in detention then and I was too depressed too thinking about my pregnant wife having 2 kids to herself. Probably, I misunderstood the question as well then I just was talking in general terms as well talking about situation in Nigeria but not telling me my story.\"6\n",
      "[15] The RPD did not find these explanations to be reasonable. The RPD pointed out that the PA is well-educated, has travelled and lived in the U.K. and speaks English fluently. The Appellants argue that the PA should be given the benefit of the doubt. The PA adequately explained that he had recently arrived in Canada, hadn't slept for 3 days and misunderstood the questions. The Appellants have cited Hamdar v Canada Minister of Citizenship and Immigration7 for the proposition that claimants should not be found lacking in credibility for a minor omission or a failure to recount full details at the port of entry. I agree with this caselaw, however, I do not agree that the omissions in both interviews are minor in nature.\n",
      "[16] In Hamdar, the claimant was interviewed by the CBSA on arrival. He gave a description of the agent of persecution and some but not all of incidents that caused him fear. The Court found the RPD had erred by expecting the Port of Entry notes \"to have revealed essentially what was revealed in the [Basis of Claim]\".8 This is easily distinguished from the present case. The PA did not fail to mention some incidents of harm. He made no reference at all to a fear of harm.\n",
      "[17] The PA was interviewed by CBSA on both February 1 and February 7, 2018. In both interviews he was asked why he left Nigeria. Neither of his answers included any mention of fear of being harmed by his uncle. I note the PA has an accounting degree, attended higher education in the UK and speaks fluent English. I agree with the RPD's finding that the PA's explanation that he misunderstood the question is not reasonable. It lacks plausibility that he misunderstood the question, \"why did you leave Nigeria?\". This is particularly so in the context of he and his family having recently crossed into Canada illegally to claim refugee status.\n",
      "[18] In my own review of the record, I note additional examples in the following excerpts from the February 7 interview:\n",
      "\"Q: How did your wife reacted [sic] when she found out you were leaving to USA without them?\n",
      "A: It was hard but she understood that I was doing it to help our family.\"....\n",
      "Q: Why did your wife travelled [sic] to USA with your kids?\n",
      "A: To come live with me, there is no hope in Nigeria.\"9\n",
      "[19] Again, the PA's answers make no mention of fear of harm in Nigeria, either to himself, his wife or their children. The PA's answers omit the basis of the Appellants' claim for refugee protection as set out in their BOCs. Both the PA and SA testified that he left Nigeria because he feared harm from his uncle. The SA also testified that as a result of being sexually assaulted and followed in her car, she too feared harm from the uncle and for this reason left Nigeria.\n",
      "[20] I find these omissions are central to the Appellants' narrative and as such draw a negative inference. As the court in Sava v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)10 noted:\n",
      "[21] In a case such as this where the Applicant says he is apolitical and makes no claim of persecution at the POE interview and then makes elaborate claims in his [BOC] and during the [hearing] in respect of persecution, the Board is certainly entitled to draw negative inferences from that omission.\n",
      "The PA omitted his job at the XXXX on schedule A\n",
      "[22] The RPD also noted that the PA had not listed his work on the XXXX in his Schedule A form, which he completed on February 1, 2018 and swore to its truthfulness in the CBSA interview. In his BOC11 and at the hearing, the PA explained that he did not list his work at the XXXX because it was not full-time work, he did not have an employment contract and he did not receive a regular salary. The RPD found this was not a reasonable explanation.\n",
      "[23] The Appellants argue the RPD should have given the benefit of the doubt to the PA as his explanation is plausible. I disagree. The Appellants' entire claim rests on the PA's work at the XXXX and the uncle's harmful actions as a result. Failing to list his work on the XXXX is a material omission. Based on this omission and those noted above in the CBSA interviews, I draw a further negative inference as to the PA and SA's credibility.\n",
      "Attempts to continue working on the XXXX are incompatible with subjective fear\n",
      "[24] The RPD found that the PA's repeated attempts to return to work at the XXXX was not coherently explained by the PA. In conducting its analysis, the RPD referred to the PA's testimony that he was violently attacked and threatened with death on several occasions and that he and his father were made ill through the uncle's black magic. He explained that he wanted to have a clear conscience as his father had always wanted him to work at the XXXX. The RPD rejected this explanation as the PA is an educated and sophisticated person and it defies logic that the PA would repeatedly make efforts to return to the XXXX when he believed his uncle would kill him. The RPD further found that the supporting documents lacked probative value as there was no testimony from the friends and family. It also found that medical reports submitted by the Appellants were not sufficient to overcome the credibility concerns.\n",
      "[25] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by assigning little weight to documents from the PA's aunt, father and brother. They say they support the PA's efforts to resolve the family conflict and the pressure he felt to continue to work on the XXXX. They argue the medical reports support the PA's narrative describing the harm caused by the PA's uncle.\n",
      "[26] I also conclude that the medical reports are insufficient to overcome the significant credibility concerns noted above.\n",
      "Documents from family members\n",
      "[27] I agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred by deciding that the family letters were of less probative value because they did not testify. Despite this error, I do not find these documents explain the implausibility of the PA repeatedly returning to the XXXX.\n",
      "[28] The letters do provide some support for the Appellants' narrative. For example, the PA's father, brother and aunt all confirm there is a family XXXX and there has been conflict between the PA and the uncle. They do not provide any specifics with respect to incidents or dates for the most part. Nor do they provide support for the PA's repeated attempts to return to work at the XXXX despite his concern that his uncle would kill him. For example, the PA's brother's letter indicates that when the family realized that the PA was abducted and threatened and had a sinister illness inflicted on him by the uncle, \"we decided that he should do all he could to leave the country\".12 Similarly, the PA's aunt's letter indicates that she went to the uncle several times after she learned of a \"rift\" between the PA and her brother in XXXX 2013, \"so the two of them can manage the XXXX together, but he refused.\"13 She refers to the PA being kidnapped, unconscious for some days and being taken to the hospital several times without a medical explanation. Although she states that there was a financial, emotional and moral cost to the family, there is no information that explains why the PA continued to try to work at the XXXX despite fearing for his life at the hands of the uncle.\n",
      "Medical reports\n",
      "[29] The RPD found that the medical reports did little to corroborate the allegations, specifically that the illnesses and injuries were inflicted by or at the instruction of the uncle. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by assessing the medical reports for what was not contained in them, rather than for what information they did provide.\n",
      "[30] I have reviewed the medical reports carefully. The report from XXXX XXXX XXXX indicates the PA was \"experiencing Exsanguinations when he was admitted to the emergency ward\" on XXXX XXXX, 2013.14 It supports the PA's claim that he was injured in some way that day requiring hospital treatment. The reports from XXXX XXXX XXXX indicate the PA's father was admitted for declining health, that no significant findings were made and that he was discharged when his family was concerned he wasn't improving.15 Finally, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX reports support that both the PA and his father were treated for spiritual illnesses.16 Certainly, these reports generally correlate with the Appellants' overall claims of injuries and illnesses to himself and his father. On their own, however, these reports do not provide sufficient corroborative evidence to overcome the significant credibility concerns.\n",
      "[31] I find that the Appellants have not credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that the injuries and illnesses they claim to have suffered in Nigeria were at the hands of the PA's uncle. I confirm the RPD's conclusion in this respect.\n",
      "Failure of PA to claim asylum in U.S.\n",
      "[32] The RPD found that it was reasonable to expect that the PA would have made some inquiries into how to regularize his status in the U.S. between his arrival in XXXX 2014 and January 2018 when he filed a claim for refugee status in Canada. The RPD rejected his explanation that he thought refugee status was only given to persons fleeing war, as the PA is well-educated and has travelled internationally. The RPD also noted that the PA's visitor visa expired on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and he had made no efforts to consider the options he had in the U.S. despite his testimony that he left Nigeria because he believed his life was in danger.\n",
      "[33] The Appellants argue that the PA believed only persons fleeing war could apply for refugee status. They argue that after the PA's visitor visa expired he was in a relationship that resulted in him being sponsored and able to obtain a work permit. The last work permit was issued XXXX XXXX, 2017 and expired in XXXX 2018. Finally, they argue the PA's profile meant the U.S. would not give him asylum after the new administration came into power.\n",
      "[34] Following my review and analysis, I cannot agree with all of the Appellants' arguments. I note that the PA testified that he left Nigeria because he believed he would be killed by his uncle. In XXXX 2014, after he learned his wife was assaulted, the PA testified he knew he could not return to Nigeria. Once in the U.S., the PA was without status from the expiry of his visitor visa on XXXX XXXX, 2015 until he married in XXXX 2015, a period of 7 months. Failing to inquire or explore any option to resolve his fear of harm in Nigeria is inconsistent with the PA's claims.\n",
      "[35] I agree that between XXXX 2015 and XXXX 2017, the PA was sponsored and this may not have caused him to be concerned about his fear in Nigeria. However, after the PA's relationship ended in XXXX 2017 and his sponsorship was withdrawn, his wife and children joined him in the U.S. in XXXX 2017. Despite his wife filing for asylum in the U.S., the PA believed that they would not be successful in the U.S. because of the American political context.\n",
      "[36] The Appellants argue that the RPD ignored three articles they submitted with respect to the U.S. political context. They argue that these articles justify the the Appellants' need to seek asylum in Canada rather than in the U.S. because of their profile.\n",
      "[37] Having completed my own review and assessment, I do not find that the RPD erred. There is no documentary evidence that indicates that the Trump administration has changed its asylum laws or that the U.S. is no longer a Signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees. I agree with the RPD's conclusion and accept the finding that the PA's failure to seek asylum in the U.S. is inconsistent with having a subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n",
      "Claim for protection in relation to sexual assault in Nigeria\n",
      "[38] The Appellants argue that the SA and her daughter should be considered Convention refugees based on the general risk of sexual violence for women in Nigeria. They allege the RPD erred by failing to conduct this analysis. The RPD decision does not make reference to the issue. I have conducted my own analysis and find that the Appellants have failed to establish the SA and her daughter would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of their gender.\n",
      "[39] Country documentation does indicate that sexual assault in widespread in Nigeria17. This alone, however, is insufficient to establish that the SA and her daughter face a serious possibility of persecution. The Appellants have the onus to show that they are individually at risk of sexual assault.\n",
      "[40] It is important to note that in order to establish the SA's claim under section 96 there must be evidence supporting a subjective fear of harm that is unrelated to the Appellants' claims with respect to the uncle as those allegations have not been established.\n",
      "[41] In her BOC narrative, the SA stated that she is fearful of the uncle and terrified that she could be sexually assaulted again. She also stated she fears the same could happen to her daughter. In testimony, she stated that she is afraid of the uncle, the men who raped her in 2013 and the man who followed her in XXXX 2017. She stated that did not know who the men were in these attacks but believes in was related to the uncle. In my review of the record, I see no evidence in relation to the SA's fear of she and her daughter being sexually assaulted other than as it is stated in her BOC.\n",
      "[42] The Appellants argue that country documentation provides an objective basis to support this claim. However, they do not provide any other support for why the female appellant and her daughter would be personally at risk. The SA is an educated woman, a teacher and lives in the south of Nigeria. She has resources and is not a vulnerable person. She does not live in a conflict area, she does not live in poverty. In addition, she is married and does not live alone. The claimants have not established that their profile gives rise to a serious possibility of persecution.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[43] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n",
