XXXX XXXX XXXX(Principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX(Minor Associate Appellants), XXXX XXXX(Associate Appellant) are citizens of South Africa. They are appealing the negative decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rendered from the bench, the day of the hearing on January 11, 2022.\n[2] The RPD ruled that Mr. XXXX XXXX, husband of the Principal Appellant, was excluded on the basis of Article 1F(a) of the Convention. In reaching this ruling, the RPD found that there were serious reasons to consider that he significantly and knowingly contributed to crimes against humanity of apartheid while he was employed as a XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX from 1990 until 1994. He was therefore excluded from claiming refugee status. The RPD further found that, even if Mr. XXXX was not to be excluded, he would still not be a Convention refugee for the same reasons that such status was denied to the other Appellants.\n[3] Indeed, the RPD concluded that the Principal Appellant and her children, the Minor Associate Appellants, had failed to establish an objective basis to their fear of being persecuted as a result of their ethnicity, namely being White South Africans, and the perception of wealth that is attached to it. The Principal Appellant and the two female Associate Appellants also failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of their gender.\n[4] I find that the RPD erred in excluding Mr. XXXX, the Associate Appellant, from refugee protection based on his alleged participation in apartheid, as a crime against humanity. Indeed, I find that: (a) the RPD erred in considering only the Rome Statute in assessing whether the alleged conduct that predated its signature constituted apartheid as a crime against humanity; (b) Apartheid, as a crime against humanity, did not form part of customary international law at the time of the alleged conduct; (c) the RPD erred in applying the mens rea of recklessness to the alleged conduct of the Associate Appellant; (d) the Associate Appellant did not contribute in a significant manner, or alternatively in a knowing manner, to the crimes against humanity, of murder and of torture, nor to the illegal common plan consisting of the implementation of apartheid.\n[5] However, I rule that the RPD correctly found that there is a lack of evidence to establish the objective basis of the Appellants' fear of returning to South Africa.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. I find that the Associate Appellant is not excluded from the refugee protection regime, pursuant to section 98 of IRPA, however, I conclude that the RPD correctly found that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of IRPA.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe evidence presented by the Appellants is accepted\n[7] According to the IRPA,1 I can only accept evidence that:\ni. arose after the RPD decision; or\nii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii. that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[8] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.2\n[9] Also, for the RAD to admit the Post Appeal Additional Evidence that was submitted after the filing of the Appellants' record, the Appellants must satisfy the requirements of Rule 29(4) of the RAD Rules. In particular, the RAD must consider the document's relevance and probative value, any new evidence the document brings to the appeal, and whether the person who is the subject of the appeal, with reasonable effort, could have provided the document or written submissions with the Appellant's record.3 Those criteria are cumulative.\n[10] On November 22, 2022, the Appellants submitted a series of additional evidence in support of their contentions regarding the Second Alazar Notice sent by the RAD on August 30, 2022, that responded to the Minister's second intervention dated October 7, 2022. It consists of academic articles and books, as well and international jurisprudence. I find that, since they are linked to the new issue that was not raised before the RPD, the Appellants could not have provided them prior to the perfection of the appeal or the RPD negative decision, thus meeting the requirements of Rule 29(4) of the RAD Rules and section 110 (4) of IRPA. They are also relevant, credible and new and they will be referred to in the analysis. Indeed, their credibility was not challenged by the Minister as they all concern known academics, or they were issued by international instances. They will be admitted into the record under P-4.\n[11] Since this new evidence does not concern the credibility of the Appellants, I find that the criteria of section 110(6) of IRPA are not met and therefore a hearing was not held.\nANALYSIS\n[12] My role is to look at all the evidence, including to listen to the recording of the hearing, and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.4\nExclusion under Article 1F(a) of the Convention\n[13] This part of the analysis is divided in the following manner: (i) the application of the Rome Statute to Pre-1998 events; (ii) the existence in customary international law of apartheid as a crime against humanity between 1990-1994; (iii)\nThe Application of the Rome Statute to Pre-1998 Events\n[14] According to section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA):\nA person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[15] Section F (a) of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention (the Convention) states the following:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes. [emphasis added]\n[16] In its analysis leading to the exclusion of Mr. XXXX, the RPD member referred to article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute), as it was implemented in Canadian jurisdiction through the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act in 2000 (CAHWCA). However, the alleged criminal conduct of Mr. XXXX took place from 1990 until 1994, at least four years prior to the signing of the Rome Statute in 1998 and eight years before its entry into force on July 1, 2002.\n[17] This is particularly important, as the main international instruments pertaining to international criminal law, prior to the Rome Statute, do not list apartheid as a crime against humanity, and neither does the definition of crimes against humanity under the Canadian legislation. In fact, neither the Charter of the International Military Tribunal of 1945 (IMT)5, the Charter of the International Tribunal enacted to prosecute crimes committed by Japan in 19466, Control Council Law No. 107, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)8, nor the Statute for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)9 list apartheid as a crime against humanity. This apparent retroactive application of a criminal law instrument to the alleged criminal acts prompted me to raise a new issue and requested the parties for additional submissions on July 6, 2022 (First Alazar Notice).\n- Parties' Submissions\n[18] The Associate Appellant submitted that the applicability or relevance of the Rome Statute and the CAHWCA to the exclusion cases dealing with alleged acts that predate their implementation is not settled in Canadian jurisprudence. He pleads that the Federal Court in the Jean-Baptiste and Verbanov cases stated that the Rome Statute should be applied to cases in which the alleged crimes occurred after its signature in 1998.10 He alleges that, when a reproached conduct occurred prior to the Rome Statute, Federal Court decisions relied on the existence of customary international law to make the finding that the enumerated act was indeed recognized as a crime against humanity at the time of the reproached conduct, as opposed to exclusively relying on the Rome Statute. Finally, he quotes the holding of Judge Pamel in the Elve case, affirming that the CAHWCA and Rome Statute attach \"new consequences for acts committed prior\" to their implementation, constituting a retrospective, as opposed to a retroactive application of the CAHWCA, but only after a discussion concluding that torture, as a crime against humanity, had been recognised in international customary law prior to the Rome Statute.11 He noted that no similar analysis was carried out in Canadian jurisprudence regarding the crime of apartheid.\n[19] The Minister relies on the Elve case to argue that a distinction needs to be drawn between the concepts of retroactivity and retrospectivity in the application of the Rome Statute, setting aside the Ventocilla precedent in which it was declared that it could not be applied to acts predating its implementation without violating the non-retroactivity ratione personae clause. The Minister affirms that the RAD must come to the same conclusions regarding apartheid, as the Rome Statute and CAHWCA are not applied retroactively, but rather attach new consequences to acts committed prior to their implementation. He adds that, well before the entry into force of the Rome Statute, the international community agreed that the crime of apartheid had to be considered as a crime against humanity, citing Resolution 2202 of the General Assembly of the United Nations dated December 16, 1966, as well as the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid of 1973 (Apartheid Convention). However, in his Additional Memorandum, the Minister argues that the Rome Statute is not a full codification of customary international law at the time of its signature.12 According to the Minister, the Rome Statute is a multilateral treaty that confers jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court (ICC) but is not an authoritative source of conventional law for the purposes of defining an international crime.13\n- Analysis\n[20] The RAD finds the Minister's arguments confusing and seemingly taking contradictory positions, which is unhelpful. It might also be symptomatic of the confusion prevailing in the Canadian jurisprudence dealing with international criminal law in refugee and admissibility cases.\n[21] The RAD believes that a distinction needs to be drawn between sections 35(1)(a) and 98 of IRPA. The former was amended to require the decision-maker to consider the CAHWCA when deciding on admissibility cases.14 However, the legislator chose not to amend section 98 of IRPA to include such reference to the CAHWCA. Indeed, section 98 of IRPA applies the exclusion regime of Article 1F(a) of the Convention that requires the decision maker to assess whether an asylum claimant could be excluded on the grounds that there are serious reasons to consider that he or she committed a crime against peace, a crime against humanity or a war crime as defined in international instruments. It thus follows that the regime of section 98 of IRPA does not require the decision maker to apply Canadian legislation in the context of its analysis. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court or Canada (SCC) in Ezokola stated that Article 1F(a) of the Convention \"instructs us\" to apply international law to reflect the realities of international crimes, beyond the boundaries of Canadian criminal law:\n[44] Whether an individual is complicit in an international crime cannot be considered in light of only one of the world's legal systems: Ramirez, at p. 315; Moreno v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1993 CanLII 2993 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C. 298 (C.A.), at p. 323. This flows not only from the explicit instruction in art. 1F(a) to apply international law, but also from the extraordinary nature of international crimes. They simply transcend domestic norms.\n[46] We are therefore required by both the text of art. 1F(a) and the realities of international crime to look beyond the bounds of Canadian criminal law. We must refrain from interpreting and applying international criminal law as if it were simply the mirror of our domestic criminal law: Cassese's International Criminal Law (3rd ed. 2013), revised by A. Cassese et al., at pp. 6-7. 15 (emphasis added).\n[22] Consequently, I find that the debate as to whether the application of the Rome Statute, as implemented in the CAHWCA, should be considered prospective, and not retroactive, in accordance with the Canadian legislation not to be relevant to the case at bar. A decision maker must assess whether the alleged crime against humanity was part of international customary law at the time of the reproached conduct, the Canadian legislation being one consideration among others.\n[23] I note that, in Verbanov, Justice Grammond referred to paragraph 223 of the Tadic Appeals Judgement of the ICTY to affirm that the definition of international crimes featured in the Rome Statute reflects the intention of the State Parties to codify international customs, supporting the presumption articulated in section 6(4) of the CAHWCA that articles 6 to 8 of the Rome Statute are part of customary international law starting on July 17, 1998, the date of the signature. I note that the ICTY Appeals Chamber was not so specific. The relevant portion of the Tadic case reads:\n223. As for the Rome Statute, at present it is still a non-binding international treaty (it has not yet entered into force). It was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the States attending the Rome Diplomatic Conference and was substantially endorsed by the General Assembly's Sixth Committee on 26 November 1998. In many areas the Statute may be regarded as indicative of the legal views, i.e. opinio juris of a great number of States. Notwithstanding article 10 of the Statute, the purpose of which is to ensure that existing or developing law is not \"limited\" or \"prejudiced\" by the Statute's provisions, resort may be had cum grano salis to these provisions to help elucidate customary international law. Depending on the matter at issue, the Rome Statute may be taken to restate, reflect or clarify customary rules or crystallise them, whereas in some areas it creates new law or modifies existing law. At any event, the Rome Statute by and large may be taken as constituting an authoritative expression of the legal views of a great number of States.16 (emphasis added)\n[24] Justice Grammond's conclusion also relies on the work of the academics.17 However, as argued by the Minister, the same articles actually discuss that the definitions of the crimes included in the Rome Statute may depart from customary international law as some elements might be the results of a consensus.18\n[25] Consequently, I find that articles 6 to 8 of the Rome Statute are, at large, a reflection of customary international law, but elements could also be the result of negotiations, while \"importing deviations and normative developments.\"19 This approach was echoed in the Ezokola case, in which the SCC stated \" despite its importance, the Rome Statute cannot be considered as a complete codification of international criminal law.\"20 In the Mugesera case, the SCC also inferred that the Rome Statute was not a complete codification of customary international law.21 I note that the Verbanov case concerns the application of section 35 of the IRPA instructing the decision maker to apply the Canadian legislation imposing a legal presumption to the effect that the Rome Statute is a reflection of customary international law, which is not the situation in the instant case. I believe that it is also important to note that the International Criminal Court (ICC) itself recognized that the Rome Statute might not always reflect customary international law, especially regarding the crimes listed under article 7 of the Rome Statute.22\n[26] In any event, the legal presumption of the Canadian legislation to the effect that the Rome Statute is an expression of customary international law featured in the CAHWCA only applies to situations that arose after the signature of the Rome Statute. Indeed, section 6 (4) of the CAHWCA indicates that, for situations that arose before July 17, 1998, the Rome Statute may be used as an indication that those crimes were part of international customary law, falling short of imposing a legal presumption:\nFor greater certainty, crimes described in articles 6 and 7 and paragraph 2 of article 8 of the Rome Statute are, as of July 17, 1998, crimes according to customary international law, and may be crimes according to customary international law before that date. This does not limit or prejudice in any way the application of existing or developing rules of international law. [emphasis added]\n[27] This can only be construed as requiring that an analysis be conducted to ascertain whether the crimes of which the claimant is being suspected formed part of the international customary law at the relevant time prior to 1998. Indeed, the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard of proof in the determination of Article 1F(a) exclusions concerns only allegations of facts, not questions of law. The decision maker must assess whether those facts did constitute a crime against humanity at the time of the alleged crime:\nWhen applying the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard, it is important to distinguish between proof of questions of fact and the determination of questions of law. The \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard of proof applies only to questions of fact: Moreno v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1993 CanLII 2993 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C. 298 (C.A.), at p. 311. This means that in this appeal the standard applies to whether Mr. Mugesera gave the speech, to the message it conveyed in a factual sense and to the context in which it was delivered. On the other hand, whether these facts meet the requirements of a crime against humanity is a question of law. Determinations of questions of law are not subject to the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard, since the legal criteria for a crime against humanity will not be made out where there are merely reasonable grounds to believe that the speech could be classified as a crime against humanity. The facts as found on the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard must show that the speech did constitute a crime against humanity in law.23 (emphasis added)\n[28] As held in the Harb case, the Rome Statute can certainly be used as a guide to evaluate whether the crime against humanity in question did form part of customary international law when the alleged criminal acts were perpetrated prior to 1998, but like in this instant case, further evidence was required to be submitted by the Minister in order to establish that apartheid was indeed a crime against humanity at the time of the alleged conduct.24\n- Federal Court Jurisprudence\n[29] In my view, this conclusion aligns with the rationale expressed by the Federal Court. I do not believe that the decision in Ventocilla stands in contradiction with the subsequent Federal Court decisions on the issue of the retroactive or retrospective application of the Rome Statute. Indeed, in those cases, the Federal Court based their conclusion on additional evidence that, when the reproached conduct occurred prior to the signature of the Rome Statute, the international crimes alleged by the Minister were part of customary international law. The Rome Statute, in and of itself, did not suffice.\n[30] In Ventocilla, the Federal Court declared that the RPD erred when it relied only on the Rome Statute to assume that the alleged war crime could be committed as part of an internal armed conflict, as opposed to an international armed conflict regarding conduct that occurred between 1985 until 1992 in Peru. It implicitly ruled that, since the Rome Statute was not applicable at the time of alleged perpetration, the decision maker needed to ascertain whether such war crimes were part of the laws and customs of war - or customary international law. It relied on the definition of war crimes provided in the CAHWCA that specified that an act or omission is a war crime when \"at the time and in the place of its commission\" it was defined as such by \"customary international law or conventional international law applicable to armed conflicts\".25 Since the Rome Statute was not in force at the time of the conduct, the Minister needed to adduce evidence that it formed part of customary international law. This interpretation is in line with section 6(4) of the CAHWCA, that indicates that for pre-1998 conducts, war crimes described in article 8 of the Rome Statute may be part of customary international law, which is insufficient to meet the legal standard for a question of law.\n[31] In Bonilla, the Federal Court was dealing with torture as a crime against humanity. It opined that, regarding this particular crime, the Rome Statute was a \"consolidation of the traditional definition which was in existence at least since 1945.\" 26 Indeed, as pointed out by the Federal Court of Appeal in the Harb case, this international crime of torture had been recognized as such since at least the trials of Nuremberg in 1945-1946 and other international instruments that came afterwards, including the IMT, ICTY and the Convention against Torture (CAT) of 1984.27 This situation led the Federal Court to declare that, in that regard, the Rome Statute was declaratory of the existence of that crime within customary international law, well before the signature of the Rome Statute. It did not rely solely on the Rome Statute in order to make that finding, but it also considered other older international instruments. The Appellants do not challenge that torture, as a crime against humanity, was part of customary international law prior to 1998.\n[32] In Betoukoumesou, the Federal Court distinguished Ventocilla, as it was dealing with war crimes and not crimes against humanity. However, I do not believe this distinction to be so relevant. In Betoukoumesou, Justice Mosley viewed section 14 of the CAHWRC, as declaratory of the applicable law at the time of the conduct, not the Rome Statute.28 Indeed, the CAHWCA did not proclaim the Rome Statute regime of modes of responsibility set forth in article 25 of the Rome Statute, nor the defense of superior order contained in article 33 of the Rome Statute as a reflection of international customary law. Instead, the Federal Court applied the rationale elaborated in the SCC case Finta in relation to the defence of obedience to superior orders applicable in both war crime and crimes against humanity cases, as it was mostly mirroring section 14 of CAHWCA.29 In my view, this case does not deal with the application of the Rome Statute within the context of an article 1F(a) exclusion.\n[33] Even in the Elve case, the Federal Court rejected Ventocilla, but in fact applied the same rationale, citing extensive evidence as to the existence of torture as a crime against humanity or war crime being part of customary international law before 1998, making the Rome Statute (and section 6 of the CAHWCA) declaratory or prospective.30 It did not rely on the Rome Statute alone to conduct predating its signature. It also cited the Betoukoumesou case which concerns the application of the CAHWCA, not the Rome Statute, but failed to draw a distinction between the inadmissibility regime of section 35 of the IRPA and the one of refugee law of section 98 of IRPA, the latter not requiring the application of the CAHWCA.\n[34] I thus find that the Canadian jurisprudence supports my earlier finding that the Minister was required to adduce additional evidence to establish that the crime of apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was part of customary law at the time of the alleged conduct.\n[35] In his intervention of July 22, 2022, the Minister pleaded that apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was part of customary international law before the signature of the Rome Statute. He relied mainly on the Apartheid Convention of 1973, the first international instrument providing a definition of the crime of apartheid for which individual criminal responsibility could be incurred. However, as revealed by the United Nations Treaty Collection Depository website, Canada never ratified nor signed the Apartheid Convention, neither did its Western counterparts.31 The Minister failed to explain how this was not relevant to the case.\n[36] Consequently, on August 30, 2022, I asked the parties for further submissions to assess whether apartheid, as a crime against humanity, formed part of customary international law between 1990 and 1994 (Second Alazar Notice).\nApartheid as crime against humanity did not form part of customary international law between 1990-1994\n- Procedural Background\n[37] In this Second Alazar Notice, the parties were requested to file further submissions to determine whether apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was part of international customary law at the time of the reproached conduct (1990-1994). The parties were also invited by the RAD to provide submissions on a list of documents annexed to the Second Alazar notice. Abstracts of relevant documents, unavailable online, were also provided by the RAD.\n[38] Following an oral request from the Minister, the Tribunal provided clarifications regarding the new issue on September 21, 2022. It is worth noting that the information then provided could be found in the abstracts and other documents listed in the annex.\n[39] The parties were given another 7 days to provide submissions. On September 22, 2022, the Minister requested an additional 14 days to respond to the new issue. He explained that the new issue further complexified an already complex case and it needed the support of the Ministry of Justice to prepare the submissions. The request was granted.\n- Parties Submissions\n[40] In his supplementary submissions, dated October 7, 2022, the Minister argues that, though the existence of apartheid as a crime against humanity has been the subject of some debate, sufficient evidence supports the allegation that such crime was recognised as a crime against humanity, under customary international law, before the coming into force of the Rome Statute in 2000. According to the Minister, the fact that Canada did not sign the Apartheid Convention is not dispositive of the question. Basing his reasoning on the Nevsun case, he opines that evidence shows the two requirements for a norm of customary international law to be recognized as such are met, namely general practice of States and the belief that such practice amounts to a legal obligation (opinion juris).32 The Minister invoked several international instruments condemning the policies and practice of apartheid that was proclaimed a crime against humanity: (i) three United Nations (UN) General Assembly Resolutions condemning policies of apartheid practised by the Government of South Africa as a crime against humanity in 1965 and 1966; (ii) the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) explicitly requiring State parties to condemn practice of apartheid; (iii) Article I(b) of the 1968 Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity defining apartheid as a crime against humanity; (iv) 1973 Apartheid Convention; (v) the 1977 Additional Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions (AP1) identified practices of apartheid as a grave breach of the treaties; (vi) two UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions stating that apartheid was a crime against humanity; (vii) the 1992 International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind in which apartheid was put \"on par\" with the crime of genocide; (viii) 1996 ILC Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind describing apartheid as a crime against humanity; (ix) ICTY Tadic case; (x) 1966 South West Africa cases, in which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stated that prohibition of racial discrimination is part of customary international law. He opined that those international instruments in which apartheid was condemned by the international community leave little doubt that the crime of apartheid was recognized as a crime against humanity even before the implementation of the Rome Statute. I note that the Minister did not articulate any submission regarding the documents disclosed in the Second Alazar Notice by the tribunal.\n[41] The Associate Appellant replied that apartheid as a crime against humanity, prior to the enactment of the Rome Statute, did not meet the requirements set out by the SCC in the Nevsun case of \"sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent.\" He argued that Canada's failure to ratify both the Apartheid Convention and the ICERD reveals that the Canadian government had the intent not to recognize apartheid as a crime against humanity, as acknowledged by recognized scholars. He cited several of those scholars, including Cassese, Schabas, and Lafontaine who reached the same conclusion after having considered the relevant international instruments. He opined that, though several of those international instruments cited by the Minister recognised apartheid as a crime against humanity, the reluctance of States to include the crime in the Rome Statute during the negotiation phase and the fact that no \"Western States\" have ratified the Apartheid Convention undermined the Minister's allegation that the opinion juris criterion was met.\n- Analysis\n[42] In the context of the international crime of slavery, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), in Nevsun, articulated the following rules underlying the formation of international customary law:\nThere are two requirements for a norm of customary international law to be recognized as such: general but not necessarily universal practice, and opinio juris, namely the belief that such practice amounts to a legal obligation (United Nations, International Law Commission, Report of the International Law Commission, 73rd Sess., Supp. No. 10, U.N. Doc. A\/73\/10, 2018, at p. 124; North Sea Continental Shelf, Judgment, I.C.J. Report 1969, p. 3, at para. 71; Kazemi Estate v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 2014 SCC 62 (CanLII), [2014] 3 S.C.R. 176, at para. 38; Harold Hongju Koh, \"Twenty-First Century International Lawmaking\" (2013), 101 Geo. L.J. 725, at p. 738; Jean-Marie Henckaerts, \"Study on customary international humanitarian law: A contribution to the understanding and respect for the rule of law in armed conflict\" (2005), 87 Int'l Rev. Red Cross 175, at p. 178; Antonio Cassese, International Law (2nd ed. 2005), at p. 157).\nTo meet the first requirement, the practice must be sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent (International Law Commission, at p. 135). To meet the second requirement, opinio juris, the practice \"must be undertaken with a sense of legal right or obligation\", as \"distinguished from mere usage or habit\" (International Law Commission, at p. 138; North Sea Continental Shelf, at para. 77).33 (emphasis added)\n[43] The ICTR Appeals Chamber specified the requirements to determine whether a norm has reached the status of customary international law, in the context of international criminal law:\n14. Norms of customary international law are characterized by the two familiar components of state practice and opinio juris. In concluding that customary international law permitted a conviction for, inter alia, a crime against humanity through participation in a joint criminal enterprise, the Tadic Appeals Judgement held that the recognition of that mode of liability in prosecutions for crimes against humanity and war crimes following World War II constituted evidence of these components. The ICTY Appeals Chamber has placed similar reliance in other cases on proceedings held following World War II, including the proceedings before the International Military Tribunal and before tribunals operating under Allied Control Council Law No. 10 (\"Control Council Law No. 10\"), as indicative of principles of customary international law at that time. For the reasons that follow, the Appeals Chamber concludes that these proceedings, as well as the text and drafting history of the Genocide Convention of 1948, lead to the conclusion that customary international law criminalized intentional participation in a common plan to commit genocide prior to 1992.34 (emphasis added)\n[44] I conclude from that jurisprudence that, in the context of international criminal law, criminalising individual participation in an international crime, the Minister needs to show a sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent State practice in recognizing apartheid as a crime against humanity, for which individual criminal liability can be incurred. This State practice may include the public exercise of executive, legislative, judicial or other functions, including decisions of national courts.35 This needs to be combined with evidence showing that States felt legally bound to implement the practice. As the analysis will show, neither criterion is met in the instant case. Judicial proceedings will have a particular significance in the analysis.\nInternational Instruments\n- UN documents\n[45] The Minister points to the UN General Assembly resolutions of 1965 and 1966 declaring apartheid a crime against humanity, a determination that was endorsed by the UNSC in 1984.36 This determination led the States to impose economic sanctions on the South African government. Indeed, the imposition of a system of apartheid was considered a grave breach of international law posing a great threat to international peace and security, giving rise to State responsibility in the arena of international law. Professor Crawford explained that the maintenance of such regime constitutes an example of peremptory norm whose violation leads to an international crime.37 However, this is distinct from the individual criminal responsibility that can be incurred as a result of one's participation in such crime, which differs from the international responsibility that can be borne by a State.38 None of those UN documents set out a definition of the crime that would allow criminal prosecution to take place while respecting the principle of legality.39\n- Apartheid Convention and other treaties\n[46] In the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of November 26, 1968, the parties condemned the policies of apartheid as crimes against humanity. The Tribunal notes that this Convention was ratified by only 57 countries, and Canada is not one of them, nor are any other Western states.40 I also note that this international instrument does not provide a definition of the crime of apartheid and focuses instead on criminalising the inhumane acts resulting from the policies of apartheid, which probably include murder, torture and persecutions that are recognised as crimes against humanity. I therefore consider the non-ratification of this Convention by Canada and others expresses a State intention not to recognize apartheid as a crime against humanity, leading to individual criminal liability. In my view, this detracts from a sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent State recognition of apartheid as a crime against humanity.\n[47] On November 30, 1973, the Apartheid Convention came into effect and garnered over 100 ratifications. It reiterated that apartheid was considered an international crime, but also provided for the first time a definition of such crime. However, as pointed out by the parties, very few of those States implemented the treaty by prosecuting the crime within their national jurisdictions and the Minister failed to provide evidence that those States implemented the Apartheid Convention in any other way.\n[48] Besides, Canada has still not ratified this Convention, and nor have most Western countries.41 I agree with the Minister that this is not dispositive, in and of itself, but it carries a significant weight, in my view. Indeed, this Convention is the first one that provides a legal definition of the crime, and liberal States championing the application and prosecution of international crimes, either through domestic prosecutions or international supports, failed to recognize it as binding.42 Furthermore, Professor Lafontaine noted that, in a response to the Universal Periodic Review of 2009, Canada responded that it was not considering ratifying this international human rights instrument.43 This is reflected in the absence of apartheid in the list as a crime against humanity in Canadian legislation, at the time of the conduct at issue in this case.44 Canada refused to consider ratifying the Apartheid Convention. It is therefore not a situation of legislative inaction on Canada's part, but rather an express governmental action against the recognition of the Apartheid Convention as a binding treaty.\n[49] The 1965 ICERD received wide support from the international community and is a binding legal instrument. At article 3, States are required to \"condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.\" I note that this provision falls short of qualifying apartheid as a crime against humanity and does not provide a legal definition of the crime. It is not at issue that discrimination and segregation, such as the apartheid policies, are prohibited, but it does not label apartheid as an international crime for which individual criminal liability can be incurred.45\n[50] The AP1, at article 85 (4) c), includes \"practices of apartheid and other inhuman and degrading practices involving outrages upon personal dignity, based on racial discrimination\" as a grave breach that could lead to individual criminal liability. However, a grave breach is considered a war crime, not a crime against humanity, and requires the existence of an armed conflict or a situation of occupation to become applicable, which was not the situation in South Africa during apartheid.46\n- International Law Commission (ILC)\n[51] In 1991, the ILC was charged with preparing a Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind (Draft Code). At that time, the ILC opted to include apartheid in the Draft Code, but to limit its scope rationae personae to \"leaders and organizers\" of the regime.47 Professor Tomuschat, Emeritus of Humboldt University in Berlin, then member of the ILC, highlighted the difference between apartheid as grave violations of human rights and contrary to public international law, and the individual international criminal liability that one can incur as a perpetrator of such crime:\nThere could be no doubt that, as ICJ had found in its advisory opinion concerning the legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia,5 apartheid constituted a denial of fundamental human rights and was therefore contrary to generally accepted rules of international law. However, the Commission was concerned with individual responsibility and the question at issue was therefore whether apartheid was a crime whose perpetrators were liable to incur an international criminal penalty. It had to be admitted that the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid had thus far had only very limited success and that none of the States of one specific region had acceded to it. It was therefore not possible to speak of universally recognized customary law and, that being so, the pacta tertiis nee nocent nee prosunt rule was fully applicable.48 (emphasis added)\n[52] It follows that apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was not included in the 1996 final text of the Draft Code, though it criminalised \"institutionalized discrimination on racial, ethnic or religious grounds\", which was meant to be a broader definition.49 Instead, the practices of apartheid were criminalised as a war crime.50 In my view, this does not show a uniform State practice of criminalising apartheid as a crime against humanity. This militates against the allegation that apartheid, as a crime against humanity for which individual criminal liability could be incurred, was part of international customary law at the time of the reproached conduct.\n- Academics\n[53] In 2008, Professor Cassese stated that apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was not part of customary international law at the time the Rome Statute was signed.51 He later acknowledged, in 2013, that its inclusion in the Rome Statute \"might facilitate the formation of a customary rule.\"52\n[54] In 2014, Eden, a lecturer at the University of Sussex, concluded that, based on its history and the principle of legality, apartheid, as a crime against humanity, giving rise to individual responsibility prior to 1998, was not part of customary international law. In 2015, Lingaas, a PhD candidate at the Faculty of Law of the University of Oslo, based on the widespread mention of apartheid as a crime against humanity in different international instruments, reached the opposite conclusion. In my view, Eden was correct when he drew a distinction between the condemnation of apartheid as a crime against humanity violating international law, and its becoming an international crime indictable in a court of law. Lingaas failed to make this distinction, though she recognized that such a crime had never been charged in any criminal proceedings.53 She also mistakenly stated that Canada had added apartheid as a crime against humanity in its legislation, which is only partially true, as it was done through the incorporation of the Rome Statute into the domestic legislation, but not included directly as such.54\n[55] This approach was also elaborated in an article by Julia Gebhard, published under the auspices of the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law. After pointing to different instruments declaring the prohibition of apartheid as a peremptory norm or ius cogens for which State responsibility can be incurred, she recognized that State practice has been insufficient to meet the criteria necessary for individual criminal responsibility for the same crime to be part of customary international law.55\n[56] Mettraux admitted that \"the only genuine remaining objection to recognizing the customary law status of apartheid as a category of crimes against humanity pertains to the adequacy of its definitional outline.\"56 He added that the definition of this crime will likely crystallise around the definition provided in the Rome Status, which reads \"inhumane acts and the suppression of the rights committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression, discrimination and domination by a racial group over another with the intention of maintaining that regime\".57 This, in the author's view, means that apartheid is now criminalized as part of customary law through the 1998 Rome Statute. Hence, it became an indictable offense when it became part of the Rome Statute, but not before.\n[57] Professor Schabas detailed the process under which the crime of apartheid became part of the Rome Statute. In the Report of the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court of 1996, the crime of apartheid was listed under \"treaty crimes\" along with illicit drug trafficking. The State parties also discussed that it could be included as a war crime, as opposed to being featured under the heading \"crime against humanity\".58 This situation evolved during the Rome Conference, as Professor Schabas explained:\nDuring the Rome Conference, Mexico proposed adding apartheid to the list of crimes against humanity. There was broad support for this, but also substantial opposition. A written amendment was submitted, entitled: 'Institutionalized racial discrimination, including the practices of apartheid.' A similar proposal was made with respect to the war crimes provision. The crime of apartheid was incorporated within the enumeration of crimes against humanity in the Bureau Discussion Paper of 6 July 1998 without any subsequent objection.59 (emphasis added)\n[58] I conclude that the work of the academics, at the very least, exposes the uncertainty of the status of apartheid as an indictable international offense, which militates against its forming part of customary international law as a result of the failure to meet the requirement of a sufficiently general, widespread, representative and consistent State practice.\n- Judicial State Practice\n[59] The crime of apartheid, as a crime against humanity, was prosecuted for the first time in South Africa in 2021.60 Indeed, the South African authorities opted for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to deal with past human rights violations committed during the apartheid regime that was instituted in 1948 and completely dismantled by 1994.61 While most of those who admitted their crimes were granted amnesty, only 800 cases were forwarded to the Public Prosecution Office for further investigations.62\n[60] Before then, as repeatedly observed in the academia, such a crime was never indicted nor tried, whether at the national or international levels.63 Though it seems that some national jurisdictions incorporated this crime into their national jurisdictions, the extent of such incorporation remains unclear and unambitious.64 It is therefore safe to say that, in practice, the implementation of the crime of apartheid as a crime against humanity, for which individuals could be indicted, remained marginal. This lack of judicial State practice militates against a finding that apartheid was part of customary international law at the time of the reproached conduct of the Associate Appellant.\n- Conclusion\n[61] Consequently, I find that the two requirements for the crime of apartheid to be part of customary international law, namely the general and uniform State practice as well as the opinion juris, are not met because: (i) the UN international instruments qualifying apartheid as a crime against humanity lead to economic sanctions, but failed to provide a legal definition of the crime to make it an indictable offense; (ii) that Canada and other like-minded countries failed to ratify the Apartheid Convention and other treaties dealing with the criminalisation of apartheid; (iii) that it was not listed within the CAHWCA definition of crimes against humanity; (iv) that members of the ILC acknowledged that it did not form part of customary international law as an indictable offence during their exchanges between 1991-1996; (v) that some States still opposed its featuring in the Rome Statute as a crime against humanity up to 1998; and (vi) that it was not prosecuted until after the adoption of the Rome Statute. I am therefore of the opinion that, between 1990 and 1994, the crime of apartheid, as a crime against humanity, as defined in article 7 of the Rome Statute, as well as the Elements of the Crime, did not form part of customary international law. Despite this conclusion, the evidence, including the UN documents and different treaties discussed above, clearly shows that, by imposing the apartheid regime, South Africa was violating a peremptory norm resulting in an international crime and thereby engaging its international responsibility as a State.\nMurder and Torture as Crimes against Humanity were Committed in South Africa between 1990 and 1994\n[62] The Minister argues that other crimes against humanity could be identified to have been committed during the apartheid regime, including murder and torture as a crime against humanity. The Associate Appellant does not contest that there are serious reasons to consider that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX(XXXX) committed those crimes during apartheid, nor that they existed as part of customary international law between 1990-1994. He submits that, as a member of the XXXX, he did not participate in those crimes and that finding otherwise would be based on his mere membership in the group, which is contrary to the Ezokola jurisprudence.\n[63] The Minister alleges that the crimes of murder and torture formed part of the international customary law system at the time of the alleged conduct.65 Indeed, both international crimes were listed in the IMT, Control Council Number 10, ICTY and ICTR Statutes and prosecuted at both national and international levels. The RAD agrees with those allegations and notes that the Appellants did not object. The tribunal therefore finds that both international crimes were part of the international customs between 1990-1994, based on the reasoning put forward by the Minister in his Additional Memorandum.\n[64] The Minister pleads that the acts committed by the XXXXamounted to murder and torture as crimes against humanity during the time of the reproached conduct, namely between 1990 and 1994. The Appellants seem to allege that the RPD and the Minister failed to conduct or submit a proper analysis of the Mugesera test, arguing that they lack references to a particular timeframe.\n[65] In the Mugesera case, the SCC distilled the following elements for crimes against humanity to be established:\n1. An enumerated proscribed act was committed (this involves showing that the accused committed the criminal act and had the requisite guilty state of mind for the underlying act);\n2. The act was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack;\n3. The attack was directed against any civilian population or any identifiable group of persons; and\n4. The person committing the proscribed act knew of the attack and knew or took the risk that his or her act comprised a part of that attack.66\n- Proscribed Acts or Conduct\n[66] The Minister alleges that the RPD rightfully found that the following acts were perpetrated as part of a widespread and systematic attack between 1990 and 1994:\n(1) widespread torture by the police; evidence of widespread ill-treatment by the police. This included widespread evidence of the police's involvement in the mistreatment of suspects;\n(2) police involvement in killing and executions. This included widespread evidence of the killing of African National Congress (ANC) supporters;\n(3) the police's key role in upholding apartheid, a general institution creating a separate system designed to uphold the privilege and power of the White minority. In this regard it was systematic, in addition to being widespread as it was perpetrated by the police against the Black population throughout South Africa.\n[67] Indeed, the evidence shows that the XXXX, mainly through the security forces division, were involved in committing such crimes. Here are some factual illustrations:\nEvents of 1990\n* Security forces were implicated in the killings of more than 1000 South Africans in the townships of Johannesburg. On March 26, 1990, the police killed 17 Black protesters in Sebokeng.67 [emphasis added]\nEvents of 1991\n* At least 217 opposition activists were detained under the Internal Security Act permitting the indefinite detention without charge of suspects. Some were reported to have been tortured.68\n* The police and military Special Forces units were widely alleged to have taken part in political assassinations and to have assisted those responsible for such killings. The police were also alleged to have acted in a biased manner in favour of the LFP and against the ANC by failing to protect ANC supporters from attack, and by not investigating killings or bringing those responsible to justice. The government denied these allegations, but a growing body of evidence emerged during the year which pointed to official responsibility for or acquiescence in a series of political killings, largely of ANC supporters.69\nEvents of 1992\n* More than 3000 people killed in Natal, many of them victims of security forces action in the fighting between supports of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and ANC. The worst incident occurred on June 17 where 49 people were killed, including children by IFP supporters. New evidence showed that covert security forces were involved in those killings.70\n* There were reports of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, with at least 121 deaths in custody in suspicious circumstances, despite the government guidelines prohibiting torture.71\nEvents of 1993\n* By the end of October 1993, a total of 3521 people were killed in political attacks as a result of the conflict between ANC and IFP.72\n* Police misconduct, including the indiscriminate use of lethal force in crowd control, and the torture and ill-treatment of individuals in police detention, remained routine during 1993. According to the HRC, 115 people were killed in actions by the security forces, and thirty-five people died in police custody in South Africa in 1993 up to the end of October. One of the most noteworthy incidents of bad crowd policing occurred in April, when police fired on a demonstration in Soweto protesting the death of Chris Hani, killing four people.73\nEvents of 1994\n* The security forces remained powerful and largely autonomous, despite profound changes;\n* the year 1994 was a turning point with the entry into force of the Interim Constitution and the Bill of Fundamental Rights. The provision of the Security Act allowing for indefinite detention without charge was repealed. Nevertheless, politically motivated killings persisted through the year. The number of unexplained deaths in police custody continued at a high level.\n* A pattern of police torture of detainees in the Vaal Triangle area of Johannesburg was revealed.74\n* A total of 94 extrajudicial killings were computed in 1994.75 The majority of those killings were a result of the conflict opposing the ANC to the IFA. The Goldstone Commission continued to show that the IFA was supported by coveted operations conducted by the security forces.76\n[68] The RPD also correctly considered evidence to the effect that the South African government established a system aiming at the separation based on race, discriminatory against the non-White population. Based on the foregoing, I rule that the RPD correctly found that the XXXXcommitted acts of murder and torture as crimes against humanity between 1990 and 1994, and that those acts were perpetrated in the context of a regime of systemic oppression and domination by the White South Africans against the non-White population.\n- Widespread and Systematic Attack Against the Population\n[69] The Minister argues that the chapeau requirement of crimes against humanity, namely the widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population, was constituted by the imposition of the system of apartheid, referring to the Mugesera case. The Appellants did not contest this allegation or RPD finding.\n[70] The regime aimed at segregating a portion of the population based on race through the violations of their human rights which constitutes, in my view, an attack against the civilian population, namely against the non-White South Africans. The ICTR in the Akayesu Trial Judgement held that the \"attack\" can also be comprised of non-violent acts, like the imposition of an apartheid regime:\n581. The concept of 'attack' may be defined as an unlawful act of the kind enumerated in Article 3(a) to (I) of the Statute, like murder, extermination, enslavement, etc. An attack may also be non-violent in nature, like imposing a system of apartheid, which is declared a crime against humanity in Article 1 of the Apartheid Convention of 1973 or exerting pressure on the population to act in a particular manner, may come under the purview of an attack, if orchestrated on a massive scale or in a systematic manner.77 [emphasis added]\n[71] This definition of an attack was later followed by the ICTY that explicitly recognized that this notion also includes mistreatments of the civilian population:\nAn 'attack' may be defined as a course of conduct involving the commission of acts of violence. In the context of crimes against humanity, an 'attack' is distinct from the concept of 'armed conflict' and not limited to the use of armed force. Rather, it may encompass any mistreatment of the civilian population. The attack may precede, outlast or continue during the armed conflict and need not be part of it.78\n[72] I understand that the ICC in the Ntaganda case rejected this approach to the application of the explicit requirement that the attack must include acts listed under article 7 of the Rome Statute. 79 However, since I am not applying the ICC definition of crimes against humanity, but rather the one hailing from customary international law, I will apply the jurisprudence of the ICTY\/ICTR and consider that the policy of apartheid formed part of the widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population.\n[73] I note the Minister's submissions at paragraphs 52 to 56 of his Additional Memorandum regarding the requirement that the attack be carried out in furtherance of a state or organizational policy was not part of customary international law, at least prior to the 1998 Rome Statute. As it was already discussed above, the RAD does not consider the Rome Statute to be a full codification of the customary international law at the time of its signature, in application of the SCC jurisprudence.80 However, it is not disputed that, the apartheid regime in South Africa was a state policy, openly codified through state legislation.81 I therefore find that, regardless of whether or not the requirement of a state or organizational policy was part of customary international law prior to 1998, the issue is not determinative in this case.\n[74] I therefore find that murder and torture were perpetrated as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a portion of the South African population, namely the non-White South Africans, between 1990 and 1994, by the XXXX.\nActus Reus and Mens Rea of Complicity as a Mode of Responsibility of an International Crime\n- RPD Findings\n[75] The RPD found that the Associate Appellant knowingly and voluntarily provided a significant contribution to the crime of apartheid through his employment as a XXXXof the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Regarding the actus reus of the mode of responsibility, it found that for four years, the Associate Appellant \"helped create openings for other positions that would further the organization's more brutal purposes\" and that he was \"involved with specifically arrested criminals\" who would be handed off to the detective unit that perpetrated widespread torture to suspects.82 Finally, it considered that assisting the XXXX in its goal, \"even its goals that were unrelated to maintaining the apartheid, nonetheless did assist them in their overall goal of maintaining apartheid\", which was found to be the basis of the Associate Appellant's \"significant contribution\". For the mens rea, the RPD found that, since the Associate Appellant worked for the XXXX on a voluntary basis, it led to the conclusion that the voluntary criterion was met. Regarding the requirement of knowledge, the RPD considered that the Appellant had been reckless as to whether his actions would further the role of the XXXX in implementing the apartheid policies, citing the Hadhiri case.\n- Parties' Submissions\n[76] In their supplementary submissions, both parties addressed this issue.\n[77] The Associate Appellant argues that the RPD's findings to exclude him were based merely on the fact that he had been a XXXX XXXX during the apartheid era, a finding akin to guilt by association. He contends that the SCC eliminated the \"guilt by association\" approach in Ezokola. He insists that a link between him and the criminal purpose of the group must be established and that he made a \"significant contribution\" to the criminal purpose, not just \"a contribution.\" In application of the Verbanov case, he opines that the RPD \"shifted its focus towards the criminal activities of the group and way from the individual's contribution to that criminal activity.\" Finally, he contests the RPD's finding to the effect that the Associate Appellant's recklessness as to whether his actions constituted part of the crime against humanity to be sufficient. He argues that the Hadhiri case must be distinguished, as it involved a high-ranking employee of the Tunisian Ministry of Interior, holding a supervisory role, who failed to look into whether torture was practised as part of the Ministry. He insists that, contrary to that case, he had a low-level position XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in a branch that was dedicated to serving the community. Finally, he contests the negative credibility findings regarding the unreasonable use of force that he might have witnessed while working in the XXXX XXXX.\n[78] In his Reply to the Minister's Additional Memorandum of November 22, 2022, he reiterates that the Minister relies on his mere membership in the group to allege his complicity in the crimes against humanity, which stands against the holding in Ezokola. He refers to the Federal Court Eriator case in which it was found that being the member of the Nigerian police force was insufficient to a conclusion of significant contribution and akin to guilt by association or passive acquiescence.83 He also suggests that, even if the imposition of apartheid is accepted to constitute \"an attack\", it is irrelevant to his case, as he was born decades after the system was put in place and he joined the XXXXwhile it was in the process of transformation and remained employed after the apartheid era.\n[79] The Minister argues that the RPD correctly concluded that the Associate Appellant knowingly made a voluntary and significant contribution to the crimes and the criminal purpose of the XXXX. He argues that the XXXXhad no legitimacy as a XXXX XXXX, since its role was limited to enforce the apartheid laws and to make sure that the system would continue. He opines that the RPD correctly found that he provided a substantial contribution to the goal of the XXXX, namely the implementation of the apartheid regime. The Minister submits that, contrary to the Associate Appellant's arguments, recklessness is enough to find a person \"knowingly\" contributed to a criminal common purpose, in light of the Ezokola case. Finally, he contends that it was reasonable for the RPD to find that it was implausible that the Associate Appellant did not know of the XXXXcriminal activities. In his Additional Memorandum, the Minister relies on the RPD findings regarding apartheid as a crime against humanity to support his position that the Associate Appellant significantly and knowingly contributed to the crimes of murder and torture as crimes against humanity.\n- Analysis\n[80] In the Ezokola case, the SCC provides a guide to assess \"whether an individual has voluntarily made a significant and knowing contribution to a crime or criminal purpose.\"84 From this statement, I understand the actus reus to be comprised of \"a significant contribution to the criminal purpose or crimes\" and the mental element to have contributed in a \"knowingly and voluntary\" manner. After a long study of the applicable customary international law, including the jurisprudence of the ICC, ICTY and ICTR, as well as other national jurisdictions, the SCC listed a series of factors against which the IRB should assess the actus reus and mens rea of the modes of responsibility:\n(i) the size and nature of the organization;\n(ii) the part of the organization with which the refugee claimant was most directly concerned;\n(iii) the refugee claimant's duties and activities within the organization;\n(iv) the refugee claimant's position or rank in the organization;\n(v) the length of time the refugee claimant was in the organization, particularly after acquiring knowledge of the group's crime or criminal purpose; and\n(vi) the method by which the refugee claimant was recruited and the refugee claimant's opportunity to leave the organization.\n[81] I find the RPD's analysis confusing: it first assessed the above-listed factors, without reaching an overall conclusion, and then moved on to determine the \"three-prong\" Ezokola test that includes whether the appellant made a \"voluntary and knowingly significant contribution\" to further the common criminal purpose, but without considering its previous assessment of the factors. According to my understanding, the SCC put forward those factors against which the Board must assess whether the appellant made a \"voluntary and knowingly significant contribution\" to the alleged crimes. These are not two separate exercises. Also, the RPD rendered its decision orally, which did not provide a clear structure to this complex analysis.\n[82] This tribunal found that the underlying acts perpetrated by the XXXXincluded murder and torture as crimes against humanity, but that the attack against the civilian population consisted, inter alia, of the imposition of the system of apartheid by the South African governmental apparatus that included the XXXX. The system of apartheid was therefore part of the common unlawful purpose imposed by the South African government. Indeed, though the tribunal found that individual criminal responsibility for apartheid was probably not part of customary international law at the time of the conduct, there is no doubt that pursuing this policy was a violation of peremptory norm by South Africa, constituting an international crime at State level.85 In Ezokola, the SCC specified that, in the context of the application of article 1F(a), \"there must be serious reasons for considering that the claimant has voluntarily made a significant and knowing contribution to the organization's crime or criminal purpose.\"86\nThe RPD erred in finding that the contribution of the Associate Appellant was significant\n[83] I believe that the RPD erred when omitting to assess the significance of the impact of the Associate Appellant's acts and conduct on the overall criminal purpose consisting of apartheid and on the crimes against humanity of murder and torture. In my view, it conflated the \"knowledge\" with the \"significant contribution\" of the Associate Appellant to the crimes committed by the XXXXand the overall implementation of the system of apartheid. I find that it also erred when it found that, by discharging his duties, he helped create openings for other positions that would further the organization's more brutal purposes. This, in my view, is dangerously close to participation through membership, since, arguably, everyone's work in the organisation allows the others to accomplish their own. Though the evidence shows that the XXXXplayed a prominent role in implementing apartheid through repressive measures, the institution was of a mix nature and the evidence needs to show more than just a mere membership to the XXXXto result in a conclusion that the RPD also mistakenly took into account the Associate Appellant's testimony that he had been \"involved with specifically arrested criminals\" in 1997 and 1998, as those events clearly fall outside of the reproached conduct period of 1990-1994 under the apartheid regime.87\n[84] I also note that this RPD conclusion was the result of the application of the Federal Court jurisprudence of the Hadhiri and Uriol Castro cases that applied the reasoning of the Rutayisire case:\nAny realistic approach to state-sanctioned crimes against humanity and genocide must acknowledge that the circle of complicity is much broader than simply those directly ordering or carrying out violent acts. It should properly encompass those who, with knowledge of the crimes being perpetrated, acted or acquiesced in administrative positions that facilitated violence and normalized brutality.88\n[85] When it comes to the actus reus of the complicity, namely the \"significant contribution\" of the appellant to the crime, it is imperative to assess the impact of possible assistance on the commission of the underlying crimes. The SCC was adamant in the Ezokola case:\nThat said, even for groups with a limited and brutal purpose, the individual's conduct and role within the organization must still be carefully assessed, on an individualized basis, to determine whether the contribution was voluntarily made and had a significant impact on the crime or criminal purpose.89 [emphasis added]\n[86] I find that the RPD erred in relying on the holding in the Rutayisire case to conclude that the Associate Appellant's contribution raised to the level of significant. The assessment of the significance of the contribution is fact intensive and one must avoid directly applying a rationale that was clearly elaborated to suit a different context. I note that the facts of the Rutayisire case, rendered before the Ezokola case, involved the commission of the genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity in Rwanda in 1994, during which 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were brutally killed in four months, between April 1994 until July 1994.90 Mr. Rutayisire was holding a high-ranking position within the administration as sous-pr\u00e9fet in the Butare prefecture during the massacres and was in charge of travel passes and military escorts that could directly save people's lives. The Federal Court relied on specific expert evidence of Alison Des Forges filed in the ICTR Butare case to establish how Mr. Rutayisire, when discharging his administrative duties, could not ignore the impact of his conduct to the commission of the acts of genocide, where his administrative acts could have a direct impact on whether a person would live or die, in the particular context of the Rwandan genocide.91 Though the Federal Court broadened this rationale to all state-sanctioned crimes against humanity in the Hadhiri and Uriol Castro cases, I believe that it is important not to apply the same reasoning to different contexts without the proper adjustments, including the impact of the alleged contribution of the appellant on the furtherance of the criminal purpose.92 As contended by the Associate Appellant, both the Hadhiri and Uriol Castro cases also involved individuals that held high-ranking positions within their respective units.93 I do not believe that the situation in South Africa between 1990 and 1994 compares to the high-level intensity of the massacres that took place between April and July 1994 in Rwanda. The direct link between Mr. Rutayisire and the possibility that his administrative actions could save lives contrasts with the far-removed connection between the Appellant and the epicentre of international crimes committed by the XXXX. I find that the RPD erred in applying a general statement meant to fit a different situation, without analysing the actual impact of the alleged conduct on the commission of the crimes and the furtherance of the illegal purpose.\n[87] I will thus proceed with my own analysis of the significant contribution of the Associate Appellant to the crime against humanity of murder and torture in light of the Ezokola factors to determine whether his alleged contribution was significant, knowing and voluntary.\n(i) The Size and Nature of the Organization\n[88] The RPD considered that, due to its limited and brutal purpose of maintaining apartheid, this factor \"pointed\" towards complicity, even in light of the large size of the XXXXand the fact that it carried out both criminal and legitimate functions. However, as it was noted by the RPD, the XXXXcounted more than 100,000 members, both XXXX XXXX XXXX. I note document\nM-10 reporting that the XXXXlacked legitimacy and functioned as an instrument of control of political opponents, while poorly equipped for crime control and prevention. M-20 states that the XXXXwas designed to be a paramilitary force, not a civilian force, especially regarding Black South Africans. However, Document M-14 describes the XXXX, with its different divisions and functions. Though the XXXXwere not structured like a regular XXXX XXXX characterizing a democratic system, it did fulfill tasks that aimed at general \"conventional\" policing, including investigating frauds, providing child protection, discharging some level of crime prevention proactive policing functions. I consider therefore the XXXXto be of a mix nature.\n[89] As it was outlined by the SCC in paragraph 94 of the Ezokola case, \"if the organization is multifaceted or heterogenous, i.e. one that performs both legitimate and criminal acts, the link between the contribution and the criminal purpose will be more tenuous.\" Consequently, I find that the size and mixed nature of the overall organization of the XXXXconstitute such a structure that it provides a tenuous link between the Associate Appellant's conduct, as a XXXX inXXXX XXXX XXXXassigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the crimes committed by the Security Forces or the common purpose of implementing the apartheid by the South African government.\n(ii) The Part of the Organization with which the Appellant Was Most Directly Concerned\n[90] It is worth emphasizing that the particular division of the XXXX that concerned the Associate Appellant, namely the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, performed day-to-day operations and comprised of around 900 XXXX XXXX around the country.94 Its functions included: the administration XXXX XXXX XXXX, crime prevention, investigation of certain categories of crime, and all other XXXX XXXX which fall outside the ambit of the other branches.95 Though the XXXX XXXX was used to implement the apartheid regime as a national policy, so was the entire governmental apparatus at the time of the alleged criminal conduct. There was no evidence that pointed at crimes that had been committed by this particular branch, as opposed to the Security and Operational branches that were responsible for murder, execution, torture and crowd control operations.96 This militates against a finding that the Associate Appellant significantly contributed to the crimes of murder and torture as crimes against humanity and the overall illegal implementation of the apartheid regime.\n(iii) The Appellant's Duties and Activities, Position and Rank\n[91] The Associate Appellant carried no executive or supervisory role within the XXXX from 1990 until 1994. In fact, the evidence shows that he was a simple XXXX who was assigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX from members of the population. There is no evidence to suggest that he refused to accept complaints from Black individuals or that he was involved in any illegal detention or arrests that resulted in torture. As articulated earlier, the RPD mistakenly took into consideration arrests that the Associate Appellant conducted in the years post-apartheid. The fact that by discharging his duties he was making room for others to possibly contribute is clearly insufficient to elevate \"possible\" contribution to the crimes to the level of \"significant\" to furthering the common illegal objective. As reiterated by the Federal Court in the Eriator case: \"Mere membership or failure to dissociate from a multifaceted organization do not find complicity. Contrary to what is implied by the IAD, guilt by association or passive acquiescence will not do.\"97\n[92] As stated before, I cannot subscribe to the reasoning that by fulfilling his duties, he was allowing the other branches to carry out the crimes, the Appellant was significantly contributing to the common purpose. I believe this link to be too stretched out and dangerously close to encompassing anyone working for the XXXX, leading to guilt by association.\n(iv) The Length of Time the Appellant Was in the Organization, particularly after Acquiring Knowledge of the Group's Crime or Criminal Purpose\n[93] Considering that the South African illegal regime had received constant condemnation from the international community since 1949, but most importantly through the UN Convention against the crime of Apartheid in 1973, it would be difficult to imagine that the Associate Appellant had no knowledge of the crimes committed by the South African government, including the police force. There was also the establishment of the Goldstone Commission in 1990 that was set up to investigate the alleged crimes, and more specifically those perpetrated by the Security Forces.98 I agree with the RPD that, considering the nature of the political regime in place, the Associate Appellant could not ignore that crimes were being committed by the XXXXover the years. This general knowledge is not sufficient to support a finding that there were serious reasons to believe that the Associate Appellant made a knowing significant contribution to the crimes against humanity. I note in particular that the Associate Appellant remained an employee of the XXXXafter the dismantling of apartheid in 1994, which could militate against a finding that he knew (or even desired) to contribute to the maintaining of the apartheid regime through his employment as a XXXX XXXX.\n(v) The Method by which the Refugee Claimant Was Recruited and the Opportunity He Had to Leave the Organization\n[94] This concerns the voluntary requirement of the mode of responsibility. I agree with the RPD's reasoning that the Associate Appellant was never under duress or forced to remain in the police force and that he joined the force voluntarily. In fact, this finding was not contested by the Associate Appellant. This could militate in favour of a contribution to the common purpose.\nConclusion as to the Appellant's Significant Contribution to Committing Apartheid\n[95] I believe that, based on the Associate Appellant's rank, duties, size of the organization and the department in which he was hired, the Minister failed to establish that there were serious reasons to consider that the Appellant significantly contributed to the common purpose of apartheid or to the crimes against humanity of torture and murder while he was employed by the XXXX.\n[96] The RPD reasoned that, by fulfilling his duties for four years, he allowed the other departments to commit the crime of apartheid. I believe the possible link between the Associate Appellant's duties and the crimes committed by another department of 100,000 strong force over the course of four years to be rather tenuous and too close to a \"guilt by association\", especially in light of his low rank and assignment to a branch that, according to the evidence submitted by the Minister, was not directly involved in the crimes recorded by Amnesty International and other NGOs.\n[97] I also note that this RPD holding was reliant on the finding that the XXXXwere one of the \"key drivers\" in charge of implementing the apartheid, which the RPD believed was not the case of every government institution that existed during the apartheid. I believe that this consideration ignores the relevant objective evidence on the topic contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP). Indeed, the whole governmental apparatus was involved in implementing the policy, including the education system, the financial network, the business and judiciary sectors. They all aimed at maintaining the privilege of the minority White population over the majority Black population with the socio-economic and legal discriminatory system, through repressive means used by the security forces or members of the justice system, though clearly the police force remained an important tool in the forced implementation of the policies of apartheid and repression.99 Also, the evidence shows that the acts of murder as crimes against humanity mostly took place between the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and African National Congress (ANC), while the security services were found to have supported those crimes through coveted operations. The crimes of torture were mostly perpetrated in prisons and during investigations, in which the Associate Appellant did not participate. I find that the Associate Appellant's duties were too far removed from the epicenter of those involved in the international crimes to have significantly contributed to them.\n[98] Consequently, I find that the RPD erred and that the Minister did not meet his burden of proof of establishing that there were serious reasons to consider that the Associate Appellant had provided a \"significant contribution\" to the illegal common purpose of implementing apartheid or of any of the crime against humanity put forward by the Minister, including murder and torture. I consider this finding to be the determinative issue regarding the exclusion in this case.\n[99] In a subsidiary manner, I will also address the mental element issue of \"recklessness\", even if it is not determinative, as I already found that the evidence does not show a \"significant contribution\" of the Associate Appellant.\nRecklessness: mens rea for mode of responsibility in international criminal law\n[100] The RPD found that it was sufficient to find that the Associate Appellant was reckless as to whether his actions would have significantly contributed to crimes against humanity of murder and torture. The Minister underlines the holding of the SCC to the effect that \"recklessness\" is an acceptable subjective awareness linking the Associate Appellant to those crimes, so therefore the RPD's finding is correct. The Associate Appellant submits that, according to the test of Ezokola, knowledge remains an important factor in determining complicity.\n[101] I agree with the Associate Appellant on this issue. The Minister refers to paragraph 68 of the Ezokola Judgement to support his position that recklessness is sufficient in the context of exclusion under article 1Fa) of the Convention. However, I note that this paragraph is located under the heading \"Summary of Complicity Under International Law\", and constitutes a preliminary finding, as opposed to the finding regarding the mens rea test finally adopted by the SCC at paragraphs 89-90 of the Judgement:\nTo be complicit in crimes committed by the government, the official must be aware of the government's crime or criminal purpose and aware that his or her conduct will assist in the furtherance of the crime or criminal purpose.\nIn our view, this approach is consistent with the mens rea requirement under art. 30 of the Rome Statute. Article 30(1) explains that \"a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge\". Article 30(2)(a) explains that a person has intent where he \"means to engage in the conduct\". With respect to consequences, art. 30(2)(b) requires that the individual \"means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events\". Knowledge is defined in art. 30(3) as \"awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events\".\n[102] As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), the International Criminal Court most likely rejected recklessness as being insufficient to meet the threshold of article 30 of the Rome Statute.100 When summarising the doctrine of the third form of Joint Criminal Enterprise (JCE III) elaborated by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda (ICTY and ICTR or ad hoc Tribunals), the SCC mainly relied on the Tadic and Brdanin Appeals Judgements.101 As pointed out in Ezokola, JCE III, according to the ad hoc tribunals, requires a finding that the accused shared the intent of the participants to the common plan. Only then can the mens rea of recklessness regarding the foreseeable crimes, namely those that were not part of the common plan, be applied.102 JCE III is a form of principle liability, not an accessory.103 In my view, this is very important, as the accessory doctrine of aiding and abetting, that could allow for the mens rea of recklessness in international customary law, requires a higher level of contribution to the crimes or to the common plan to result in criminal liability.104 Such contribution must have a \"substantial\" effect over the crimes or common plan, as opposed to only be significant.105\n[103] The actus reus of \"significant contribution\" combined to a mens rea of \"recklessness\", divorced from any finding of intent to participate in the common criminal purpose, as a form of participation in an international crime, was considered insufficient to result in criminal liability by the ad hoc tribunals. Responding to concerns raised by the Brdanin Defence Team, the ICTY Appeals Chamber reiterated, in the excerpt cited by the SCC in Ezokola, that a finding of intent to participate in the common plan is necessary for the significant contribution to result in a criminal liability, in order to avoid guilt by association.106 This interpretation concurs with the one of the Refugee Convention by the UNHRC's recommendation requiring that a substantial contribution of the asylum claimant to the international crimes be established with his or her knowledge that his or her act or omission would facilitate the criminal conduct in the context of an article 1F(a) analysis.107 This corresponds to the material and mental elements of aiding and abetting, not the ones of JCE III.\n[104] In short, the common Appeals Chambers of the ICTY and ICTR teach us that, for recklessness to be accepted as mens rea standard, the Minister needs to prove that the Appellant intended to participate in the furtherance of the common purpose. It follows that the RPD erred in applying the recklessness standard to the instant case without a finding that the Associate Appellant shared the intent to participate in the furtherance of the common plan, namely the imposition of apartheid, or that his alleged contribution had a substantial effect over crimes against humanity of murder and torture.108\n[105] The SCC requires that the Canadian jurisprudence and legislation be construed in such a way that it is not in conflict with Canada's international obligations.109 In my view, the analysis of the SCC elaborated in paragraphs 62 to 68 of the Ezokola judgement constitutes a summary of the different modes of liability recognized by the ad hoc tribunals to determine whether guilt by association was an accepted form of liability in international customary law: its conclusion is not operative or meant to be directly applied to the 1F(a) cases. Paragraphs 84 to 90 contain the operative findings of the SCC, that rejects the application of recklessness as a mens rea in application of article 30 of the Rome Statute.\n[106] I believe that the Federal Court in Hadhiri misconstrued Ezokola. Indeed, it considered that paragraph 68 of Ezokola permitted \"to find individuals guilty of complicity under international law if they have knowingly or recklessly made a significant contribution to a crime or criminal purpose of the group to which they are associated.\"110 This interpretation is misleading as it fails to reflect international customary law standards.\n[107] I therefore conclude that the RPD erred when it found that recklessness was sufficient to meet the mental requirement for participation in international customary law and, therefore, that the Associate Appellant recklessly participated in the crimes against humanity of murder and torture or in furthering the illegal common purpose.\n[108] I already found that I do not believe that the alleged contribution of the Associate Appellant rose to the level of \"significant\". Even if it did, the Minister did not adduce sufficient evidence to support a finding that there were serious reasons for considering that the Associate Appellant, through his position as a XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, knowingly contributed to the commission of crimes against humanity (murder or torture), or to the implementation of the apartheid policy as an illegal common purpose of the South African governmental apparatus. Indeed, his duties were too far removed from the alleged crimes against humanity. Nothing reveals that he would know he was contributing to them, even if he was aware that the XXXXwere committing those crimes. Also, since all government apparatus were implementing the policy of apartheid, everyone in the government was contributing to this illegal common purpose. I understand that the police force was particularly involved in implementing the policy, but nothing reveals that the Associate Appellant's branch was directly involved in the perpetration of those crimes, like, for instance, the Security Forces.\n[109] Consequently, I am of the opinion that the RPD erred in excluding the Associate Appellant from the refugee protection regime pursuant to article 1F(a) of the Convention either because the Minister failed to establish serious reasons to consider that the Associate Appellant significantly contributed to crimes against humanity or, alternatively, that he knowingly contributed to the crimes or common plan. I am therefore reversing this conclusion and will assess whether Mr. XXXXqualifies as a Convention refugee as alleged and found by the RPD.\nThe RPD Was Correct when It Found that the Appellants Were not Convention Refugees\n[110] The RPD found that the Appellants testified in a credible manner. However, their allegations remained unsupported by the country condition evidence that, instead, indicated that crimes alleged were economically, as opposed to racially motivated. The RPD considered that, though evidence pointed at some instances of crimes directed against White South Africans that were racially motivated, the objective evidence indicates that the vast majority of crimes against the White population are not so. All in all, the RPD acknowledged the genuine subjective fear of the Appellants of returning to their birth country, but ruled that there was a lack of evidence underpinning their allegation of an objective basis of that fear. Finally, it decided that the Appellants would face the same risk linked to generalised criminality plaguing the South African society as a whole, which does not allow for granting protection under section 97 of IRPA.\n[111] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred when it assessed whether there was a serious possibility that they would be subjected to one of the specific types of crimes that are included in the country conditions evidence, instead of assessing whether they would be subject to persecution based on the Convention grounds of race as White South Africans and membership in a particular social group as White South Africans perceived wealthy. They opined that the RPD also erred by applying an incorrect test by requiring evidence that extreme violence is disproportionately felt solely by White South Africans. They also submit that the RPD erred in reaching its conclusions by ignoring relevant evidence which supported the Appellants' narrative, while rejecting the claim because not all crimes experienced by White South Africans are racially motivated. In any event, they plead that they still benefited from the Maldonado truthfulness presumption and were not required to produce corroborative evidence. They argue that the RPD reached inconsistent findings by first holding that they will likely experience similar attacks when they returned to South Africa, but falling short from qualifying those recurrences as a serious possibility of persecution. They also opine that the RPD member erred by attaching too much weight to the lack of evidence of racially motivated crimes towards White South Africans in annual international reports contained in the NDP. They further submit that the tribunal erred by discarding documents on the basis that they were crowdsourced, while not clearly identifying the documents to which the tribunal attached low weight. Finally, they contend that the tribunal erred in its reading of the surveys, by failing to understand the connection between the feared crimes and the racial animus against South Africans Whites by Black South Africans, pointing at the public hate rhetoric of Black politicians against the Whites.\nNexus to the Convention\n[112] It is unclear what the RPD member considered to be the nexus to the Convention, but the member stated that he was \"willing to provisionally accept\" that the Appellants are members of a particular social group (PSG) formed by individuals targeted for their perceived wealth as a result of the apartheid. The tribunal specified that PSG would have to be targeted for more than economic reasons, as this has been excluded by the jurisprudence.\n[113] In his Basis of Claim form (BOC), Mr. XXXXwrote that he was not asking for refugee status as a member for the social group \"Whites in South Africa\". Instead, he claims that he is basing his refugee claim on \"race\", because he is White. Unfortunately, I am not sure I understand the difference. In their appeal submissions, the Appellants argue that they are members of a PSG defined as \"White South Africans perceived as wealthy\". He affirms that the international human rights reports do not reflect the reality in South Africa, as, contrary to what it is reported, \"violence of Blacks against Whites\" is a frequent occurrence among his circles. They also put forward that a refugee claim cannot fail only because they did not adduce extrinsic evidence to corroborate it.\n[114] I note that in the Yusuff case, the Federal Court reiterated that \"this Court has consistently held that perceived wealth, without more, does not constitute a particular social group\". 111 In the case of South Africa, the nexus is mixed, as race and perception of wealth can intertwine.\n[115] However, and it will be further analysed, objective evidence contained in the NDP states that White South Africans do not face particular challenges when it comes to employment, education and housing, a statement that is not contested by the Appellants.112 It also indicates that the White South Africans still hold a \"privileged position\" within the society, explaining that \"the net wealth of Black South Africans is only about five per cent of the average net wealth of White South Africans. White South Africans in South Africa live in the \"First World\"; their social and economic standard of living is similar to that in Eastern Europe or Israel.\"113 This, in my view, supports the finding of the RPD to the effect that the White South Africans are mostly targeted as a result of the high crime rate plaguing the country and because of their actual, as opposed to perceived, wealth.114 As wealth is not recognized as a valid ground of persecution, I will analyse whether there would be a serious possibility that the Appellants be subjected to persecution based on their race, if they were to return to their birth country. I will also analyse the risk under section 97 of IRPA.\nThe RPD Correctly Assessed the Appellants' Evidence\n[116] The Appellants testified that they were themselves victims of racially motivated crimes: (1) in XXXX 2011, when XXXX was almost snatched from Mrs. XXXXarms while at the bank machine; (2) in XXXX 2017, the adult Appellants were afraid that their daughter would be taken from the hospital; (3) six incidents in 2016 when Mrs. XXXXand her children were almost run over by Black taxi drivers. They also alleged that several White children were 'mowed over' by Black taxi drivers in recent years. They report the case of a friend's mother, XXXX XXXX, who was brutally tortured and murdered by her garden domestic helper. In XXXX 2017, the Appellant's aunt was attacked trying to prevent her own daughters from being raped by four Black men. The Appellants also talk about the six incidents during which their house was broken into by Black people. Finally, he recalls an incident when his car was almost stolen.\n[117] I agree with the RPD that, even if some of the violence seems to be racially motivated, the bulk of them were rather perpetrated for economic purposes, such as the breaking in the house. Even the attempt to snatch the boy from Mrs. XXXX can probably be seen as targeting to obtain a possible ransom, as she was taking money out of the bank machine at the relevant time.\n[118] As alleged by the Appellants, the racial tensions run high in South Africa. Corroborated by the objective evidence, utterances from some politicians display unacceptable racial hatred against the White minority.115 I also note the Facebook posts submitted by the Appellants in support of their allegations that they fear persecution based on their skin colour if they were to go back to South Africa.\n[119] I agree with the RPD that the episodes of racially motivated violence, such as the attempted run overs the Appellants experienced or those reported in the objective evidence they submitted, do not amount, in and of itself, to a serious possibility of persecution. As pointed out by the tribunal, though those incidents can be distressful, they do not support a systemic criminality based on racial discrimination against White South Africans.\n[120] I reject the Appellants' contentions to the effect that the RPD erred in ignoring evidence or selecting evidence that did not support their narrative. I note that the Appellants failed to identify which documents were in fact ignored and the impact it would have had on the conclusion.\n[121] As it will be later analysed, other pieces of evidence that demonstrate violence based on racial hatred are not sufficient to rise to the level of serious possibility of persecution.\nThe RPD Correctly Found the Lack of Objective Basis of the Fear of Persecution\n[122] The RPD accepted that the Appellants genuinely fear returning to South Africa, a finding that is correct according to my reading of the evidence. However, I agree with the RPD that the targeting of White South Africans is predominantly based on economic reasons as they are, in fact, wealthier, as noted above.\n[123] The RPD noted that documents contained in exhibits C-16, C-13, C-17 and C-23 report clearly racially motivated crimes, as well as video 5. I agree with this assessment.\n[124] I also note the affidavit of Mr. XXXX, XXXX of XXXX XXXX, dated March 2, 2012, in which he opined that English-speaking White South Africans are the subject of hate crimes, and when racial epithets are uttered during the commission of a crime, such crime can be deemed to be motivated by hate. As for violent crimes against White South Africans that remain unreported, it mostly concerns farm murders as indicated in the affidavit by XXXX XXXX, dated June 2, 2012. As pointed out by the RPD, the Appellants are not part of that group. In another affidavit dated October 10, 2014, the same affiant complains that main NGOs do not report hate crimes perpetrated against White individuals, but no explanation is provided. Also, I note that Mrs. XXXX explains in this affidavit that the upper-class and middle-class homes can afford to strengthen their security systems to repel possible aggressors, a commodity that the poorer Black communities can probably not afford, which explains why they are more likely to fall victim to violent crimes.\n[125] I also find that the Appellant's documents show that, at times, the justice system properly intervened to investigate and prosecute the suspects of those racially motivated violent crimes. At page 97 of the Appellants' disclosure material, the author stated: \"The country's high crime statistics (nearly 19,000 murders a year) have undermined cohesion and investment. Following the erosion of their privilege, Afrikaners feel particularly vulnerable, both as Whites and as linguistic minority.\" I believe that this accurately describes the situation of the Appellants as feeling vulnerable in the face of high crime rates, which does not necessarily follow that they would face a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to South Africa.\n[126] The Appellants also submitted the former Response to Information Request (RIR) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) dated 28 May 2013, under Exhibit 16, p. 100 stating that: \" ... based on the 2011-2012 XXXX annual report, White and Asian South Africans are less likely than African or Coloured South Africans to be murdered, and stresses that socio-economic status, rather than racial classification, determines the likelihood of being a victim of a violent crime.\" In effect, this supports the RPD conclusion that, while White South Africans are victims of violent crimes that are sometimes also hate crimes, the overall statistics show that Black South Africans remain the primary victims of those crimes that are a result of socio-economic status, as opposed to based on racial hatred.\n[127] I note the additional information provided by the Appellants that include two new incidents that occurred to individuals in their circles. The first incident described in an email dated October 24, 2019, involves a robbery of a family house during which no one was gravely harmed, though an elderly victim succumbed from PTSD. This indicates that the motives were most probably economical, as opposed to based on racial hatred.\n[128] The Wikipedia page that was attributed no weight by the RPD concerns the movement Black First Land First (BLF) which pleads for the policy 'expropriation without compensation' aiming at taking the lands from White-owned land. This mainly relates to White farmers, a group to which the Appellants do not belong. Also, I am cognizant of the racial tensions in South Africa as a consequence of the apartheid and hate speech that take place against the White minority as a result. However, South Africa is also plagued by a very high crime rate that affect the population as a whole. Though the White population is more likely to face a certain kind of crime due to their actual or perceived wealth, they are less likely to face others, as it will be more extensively discussed below.116\nObjective Documents of the NDP Do Not Support the Appellants' Allegations\n[129] I reject the Appellants' contention that the RPD erred in attaching weight to the absence of information in the annual international reports contained in the NDP. As pointed out by the member, it is reasonable to expect that either the US Department of State's human rights report, the Amnesty International's State of the World Human Rights report, the Human Rights World Watch Report, or the Freedom House's Freedom in the World report would have reported if the White South Africans were persecuted on the basis of their race, if that were the case. I note that, in the newest NDP, the US Congressional Research Service report that White farmers are \"periodically victimised in criminal attacks\".117 Those attacks were labelled as opportunistic and, sometimes, also racially motivated. It specifies that the xenophobic mob violence target mainly foreigners, while many Whites often live in gated, highly secured communities.118\n[130] I note that in document C-10, that Trade union Solidarity submitted a complaint to the United Nations (UN) Committee on the elimination of Racial Discrimination regarding hate speech targeting minorities. Yet, I observe that the Appellants have failed to submit any report from the competent UN or African international mechanisms that could reveal the extent of the violence waged by Black individuals against White South Africans. I therefore reject the Appellants' contention that the RPD erred by attributing too much weight to the absence of information in the NDP. Indeed, the burden lays on them to show that reliable reports, whether governmental or not, provide the information to support their allegations. The evidence of single incidents, though relevant, is insufficient. I believe that going on a case-by-case basis can be misleading and is preferable to rely on reports that show the bigger picture concerning the situation of White South Africans within the population as a whole.\n[131] I also reject the Appellants' contention that the RPD erred in omitting to understand the connection between the feared crimes and the anti-White rhetoric. I reviewed the analysis elaborated at pages 14 to 18 of the oral decision, and I find that the RPD was correct in its observations. The Appellants failed to point at any error in that regard.\n[132] Indeed, I agree in particular with the conclusion that, even if White-headed households seem to fall disproportionally victims to burglary and car theft, it finds a reasonable explanation by the fact that the White minority still owns a majority of the wealth in South Africa, including business opportunities and landownership. The NDP reveals that South Africa still arbours the highest rates of inequality of the world and the richest 10% still hold around 71% of the country's wealth.119 The disparity must also take into account that \"crimes experienced by poor and vulnerable individuals are far less likely to be reported or recorded by the police.\"120 In any event, it is to be expected that wealthier individuals will be more likely to be targeted by economic crimes, such as robbery and car hijacking, which, in South Africa, translates into White minorities.\n[133] I note that the RPD conducted a cross analysis between the statistics regarding the crimes and the possible racial motivation behind them. It correctly considered that, had those crimes been perpetrated based on racial hatred, it would have been expected that a much higher proportion of cars belonging to White individuals to be targeted, which is not the case. The Appellants did not show how this analysis was flawed, especially when 91% of White individuals own a car, as opposed to 20% for their Black counterparts. Consequently, I believe that the RPD correctly concluded that the slightly disproportionate number of economic crimes to which the White South Africans fall victim is explained by their advantageous economic situation.\n[134] Regarding violent crimes, I note that South Africa ranks fifth in the world as the number rate per capita. The reasons for such a high rate were attributed to diverse causes including socio-economic inequality and marginalization and social bias. However, violent crimes, including assault, sexual assault and murder, combined correspond to 5.5% of the totality of the criminal offences registered.121 As pointed out by the RPD, out of the 16,000 murders reported, only 182 concerned White South African victims. Those numbers reveal that the White South African group is therefore less at risk of a violent crime than their Black countrymen. Though hatred-fuelled violent crimes do take place against the White population, the overall statistics do not support the allegation that the risk faced concerns more than a mere possibility.\n[135] The survey also shows that White South Africans enjoyed a better relationship with the police, contrary to the Appellants' experience, especially in comparison with the Black population. As pointed out by the RPD, this does not support the Appellants' allegation that the police force is discriminating against the White population. Again, the Appellants did not explain how this analysis is erred.\n[136] As it was pointed out by the RPD, the Appellants failed to address the conclusion of the Race Relations report in South Africa stating that \"race relations in South Africa held up surprisingly well during 2018\", despite the strong racial rhetoric from the political parties, especially noting Mr. Malena's hate speeches.122 I find that the analysis of the RPD regarding this issue is correct and that the Appellants failed to identify any errors.\n[137] I therefore agree that, overall, the objective evidence of the NDP shows that South Africa experiences a very high crime rate affecting the population as a whole. While the White population is more targeted when it comes to economic crimes based on their actual greater wealth, the surveys show that the Black population is more likely to be victims of violent crimes, especially as a result of gang violence.123\n[138] Consequently, I rule that the RPD correctly found that there was a lack of evidence to support the allegation that the White South Africans perceived as wealthy are disproportionally targeted because of their race, rather than because they are actually wealthier and thus represent better targets for economical crimes. The Appellants failed to establish a nexus to the Convention, as perceived or actual wealth is not recognized as a basis for persecution.124\nThe RPD Correctly Found Insufficient Evidence of Gender-Based Persecution\n[139] The RPD judged that the female Appellants have failed to lead evidence showing an increased risk of gender violence, beyond the one faced by the population as a whole.\n[140] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred by requiring that they provide evidence that would put the female Appellants specifically and personally at an increased risk in comparison to the rest of the population. They further argue that the RPD failed to take into account the Chairperson Guidelines 4 regarding refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution. They underline the passage of the Guidelines referring to the Salibian case stating that it was unnecessary for them to put forward a basis of an individualized set of facts. They opine that the RPD ignored the ample country condition evidence of the NDP, indicating that women face severe discrimination and are at risk of sexual violence and failed to refer to evidence in support of its conclusion.\n[141] I agree with the Appellants that the RPD omitted to refer to the Gender Guidelines in the context of its analysis on allegations of gender-based persecution. I will ensure that the RPD analysis respects such guidelines in the framework of my own analysis and I will also consider them as part of my independent review of the evidence.\n[142] The objective evidence reveals that South African women face discrimination in all areas of life:\nAlthough all South Africans are nominally equal under the law, discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ability, nationality and sexual orientation is still widespread. South Africa remains a socially conservative and patriarchal state and this manifests in exceptionally high levels of gender-based violence and rape.125\n[143] As pointed out by the Appellants, documents contained in the NDP, either the one of July 30, 2021, or the newest one, establishes that gender-based violence (GBV) and feminicide are a problem in South Africa, 51% of surveyed women in the Gauteng province and 44% of the Western Cape were victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives. Domestic violence is very prevalent and constitutes the cause of 54% of feminicide.126 The Appellants are from Johannesburg, a city located in the Gauteng province.\n[144] Other documents of the NDP put forward the following relevant information:\nAlthough the law criminalizes domestic violence and rape of men or women, the number of reported raped cases rose from 41,583 in 2018-2019 to 42,289 in 2019-2020. South Africa has some of the world's highest rates of gender-based-violence and femicide. Most perpetrators were acquaintances or family members of victims. Although laws prohibit sexual harassment, it remains a widespread problem for women.127 [emphasis added]\n[145] The violence against women is said to be a pervasive issue in South Africa. It triggered State action through the creation of independent institutions to safeguard civil rights and a governmental action plan to combat GBV in 2019.128 I note that the evidence does not segregate White from Black victims.\n[146] Mrs. XXXXdoes not allege having been the victim of or fearing violence from her partner. There is no allegation that the female Appellants fear acquaintances or family members either. I understand that none of them have been victims of GBV in the past from family members or others. I note that violent crimes account for only 5.5% of all crimes in South Africa. According to the Appellants' evidence, a person aged above 16 years old faced a 0.25% chance in 2018-2019 of being the victim of sexual violence.129 Though the GBV is a scourge in South Africa, the Appellants do not possess the profile of females that would face a serious possibility of persecution based on their gender, as demonstrated by the objective evidence. Nothing in the Chairperson's Guidelines would indicate otherwise.\n[147] Even when considering the intersectionality between gender and race in the context of a fear based on perceived wealth, I am unable to find evidence that would put the female Appellants in a position of facing a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to South Africa. There is no evidence that the White South African females are being targeted by gender-based violence through the lens of perceived wealth, but rather in the context of personal, domestic relationships.\n[148] Consequently, I believe that the RPD was correct when it ruled that the Appellants failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of their allegation that they would face a serious possibility of gender-based persecution if they were to return to South Africa.\n[149] Based on the facts alleged, the Appellants also failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that they would face a personalised risk, as define by section 97 of IRPA, beyond general criminality. Indeed, as illustrated above, the crime rate in South Africa is particularly high, but section 97 (1) b) (ii) of IRPA excludes a risk that is faced generally by other individuals in a country, such as general criminality.\nCONCLUSION\n[150] I dismiss the appeal. I find that the Associate Appellant is not excluded from the refugee protection regime, pursuant to section 98 of IRPA, however, I conclude that the RPD correctly found that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of IRPA.\n(signed)\nMe Martine Durocher\nMe Martine Durocher\nFebruary 2, 2023\nDate\n1 Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration v.

He is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his refugee protection claim because he failed to rebut the presumption of state protection.\nSummary of the relevant facts\n[2] The appellant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019. He alleges that he fears the family of his former girlfriend with whom he had intimate relations between XXXX 2018 and XXXX 2019. Her family discovered the relationship between the two, and the girlfriend's brother allegedly initiated a plan to avenge honour by going after the appellant. In late XXXX 2019, his girlfriend's brother physically assaulted the appellant and tried to slit his throat with a knife. The appellant managed to run away. The agent of risk then traced his telephone number and called him and uttered threats. The appellant sought refuge at his grandmother's home in downtown XXXX. Shortly before his departure, he had a chance encounter with his agent of risk, who allegedly beat him and left him unconscious. That was when he decided to leave for Canada.\nThe Refugee Protection Division's position\n[3] The RPD concluded that the appellant's testimony was generally credible concerning the events experienced in Algeria. It concluded that the appellant failed to establish the state's inability to ensure his protection. The fact that he failed to report his fears to the police authorities and the explanations provided to justify this failure are not reasonable. The explanations are contradicted by the objective documentary evidence. The appellant did not take measures to give the state a real possibility of protecting him.\nThe appellant's position\n[4] The appellant criticizes the RPD for failing to consider the objective evidence demonstrating the lax approach the police take to private matters, for failing to consider the evidence indicating that relationships outside of marriage are the primary motive for honour crimes and that, while honour crimes are rare, they do exist. He argues that the police are effective when it comes to organized crime but not honour crimes. He adds that Islam forbids relations outside marriage. Lastly, he criticizes the RPD for failing to provide clear reasons regarding the risk he faces and for failing to consider news articles showing that honour crimes are frequent in Algeria. He criticizes the RPD for dismissing his testimony regarding his agent of risk and his criminal activities, and the possible connection to the police, without providing any details.\nDeterminative issue\n[5] The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division is state protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD's decision is correct. The appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. I conducted my own analysis of the record. The exclusion under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(i)1 clearly indicates that, for a person to be declared a person in need of protection, it must be demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that they are justified in not seeking state protection, or that they are unable to do so because the agent of risk is a state actor. The reasons the appellant gave for failing to avail himself of state protection are speculative. There is no such thing as zero risk. The explanations provided by the RPD are correct.\nANALYSIS\nStandard of review\n[7] My role is to review all the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.2\nRole of the appellant\n[8] The onus is on the appellant to identify the errors that are the grounds of the appeal and where the said errors are located.3\nFramework of analysis\n[9] The RPD concluded that the appellant's claim is not based on one of the grounds set out in the Convention and that the claim must therefore be analyzed under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The appellant did not challenge the framework of analysis. Because the appellant fears an individual who seeks to avenge his family's honour for relations outside marriage, I am of the opinion that the RPD's conclusion is correct.\nCredibility\n[10] The RPD considered that the appellant's testimony was generally credible. It found the appellant credible with respect to the events that took place in Algeria, including the XXXX 2019 assault and that of XXXX 2019. I am of the opinion that the conclusion is correct regarding the sincerity of the appellant's fear of his agent of risk. Therefore, subject to comments on the reliability of the evidence, I find the appellant to be credible.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in its analysis of state protection\n[11] The RPD reiterated the principles set out in Ward,4 which establishes that a refugee protection claimant must provide clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect absent an admission by the national's state of its inability to protect that national. Accordingly, prior to seeking the protection of another country, refugee protection claimants must demonstrate that they took every reasonable measure to seek the protection of their home state.\n[12] The appellant testified that he did not report his agent of risk to the authorities, either after the threats of XXXX 2019 or when he was beaten outside a XXXX in downtown Algiers in XXXX 2019. When asked to explain why he did not file a complaint, he stated that it was because the police in Algeria do not intervene in domestic matters and that the police would not have done anything to help him. He feared that the police would have placed the blame on him, because he had a relationship outside marriage. He also feared being targeted by his agent of risk if he filed a complaint. He alleges that his girlfriend warned him that her brother was engaged in drug trafficking in the neighbourhood and that he feared him for this reason. He asserts that his agent of risk may have contacts with the police.\n[13] The RPD conducted an analysis of the objective evidence, which demonstrates that the Algerian police may be considered effective. The evidence shows that the murders that have been committed have been addressed. The evidence does not show statistics regarding honour crimes, but these are extremely rare and infrequent in urban areas. They generally occur in rural areas. In the last few years, the Algerian police have deployed significant resources to ensure the safety of citizens, resulting in a 4% reduction in non-political crimes in 2016, including assault and voluntary manslaughter. As the RPD stated: [translation] \"It appears that the government has taken reasonable measures to establish and run an effective legal system for detecting, prosecuting and punishing acts that constitute persecution and that this system is generally accessible to Algerian citizens.\" It concluded that the Algerian state has the ability and the will to implement effective measures to protect its citizens, ensuring adequate protection.\n[14] On appeal, it is argued that the RPD erred in its analysis and its conclusions regarding state protection. The appellant submits that the objective documentation demonstrating crime control relates to non-political crimes and not to honour crimes. He submits that Algerian law is the law of Islam, which does not permit relations outside marriage. He adds that, while honour crimes are rare, they do exist and that the state does not wish to intervene in honour-related matters. He argues that the RPD's analysis of whether his agent of risk could be a person of interest to the police because of his drug-selling activities is completely unrelated to honour crimes.\n[15] After analyzing the documents cited by the RPD and the appellant, I am of the opinion that honour crimes are rare in Algeria. They occur mainly in rural areas, [translation] \"where the honour of women is governed by a stricter code of conduct. In urban areas, where education levels and socio-economic development are higher, honour crimes are infrequent\" [emphasis added].5 I am of the opinion that the appellant's arguments are not supported by documentation that is as categorical as he asserts. It is true that the police may be reluctant to interfere in people's private lives. However, the documentation shows that the victims of honour crimes are generally women. The documentation presented by the appellant before the RPD6 relates events where crimes committed against men occurred when they were caught in the act. It also shows that the perpetrators of these crimes were either arrested and detained or received prison sentences.\n[16] On the basis of these facts, it cannot be concluded that Algerian nationals cannot seek state protection, given the principle that no state can guarantee full protection. The onus is on the refugee protection claimant to show, on a balance of probabilities, that they cannot obtain state protection. This is assessed based on the refugee protection claimant's personal situation, the alleged risk, the agent of persecution and the country conditions. The country conditions were analyzed and the RPD's conclusion is correct with respect to the country conditions.\nPersonal situation, risk, agent of risk\n[17] The appellant testified that his agent of risk threatened him after discovering the relationship that he had with his sister. He allegedly attempted to attack him with a knife in XXXX 2019. The appellant reportedly took refuge at his grandmother's home in downtown XXXX, where he lived without any problems until XXXX 2019. He stated that as he was leaving a XXXX in downtown Algiers he ran into his agent of risk, who assaulted him and left him unconscious. The appellant testified that he did not file a complaint because the police were reluctant to deal with domestic matters. In addition, he did not dare to file a complaint against his agent of risk, who sells drugs in the district where he lived, which made him a dangerous person who could attack him again if the agent of risk learned that a complaint had been filed against him. He also asserts that it is possible that his agent of risk is in collusion with the police. Lastly, he fears that the police would place the blame on him because of the extramarital relationship that he had with his ex-girlfriend, as relations outside marriage are frowned upon in Algeria.\n[18] The RPD considered that the appellant's answers were not satisfactory. According to the RPD, citizens are responsible for seeking and obtaining protection from their state authorities, except where it is objectively reasonable not to do so. The RPD considered that the appellant's reluctance to request protection was based on speculative subjective fears that are not corroborated by the evidence.\n[19] The appellant repeats the arguments that Algerian justice is lax when it comes to private matters. The police are rarely cooperative, and relationships outside marriage constitute the primary motive for honour crimes. He argues that the RPD minimized the risk by relying on generalities. For the appellant, even though the risk is greater in rural areas than in urban areas, the risk in urban areas is not zero. In addition, no formal investigation has been carried out regarding the prevalence of honour crimes in Algeria. Nonetheless, such events are reported in the Algerian press or in autobiographical works from time to time. He adds that he established that his girlfriend's brother is a dangerous drug trafficker who is involved in organized crime. Responding to the RPD's argument that reporting a drug trafficker would benefit the appellant, he argues that there is no connection between organized crime and the honour crime that he fears. He argues that Algeria is a Muslim country whose state religion is Islam and relations outside marriage are forbidden in Islam. This means that he cannot trust the police to press charges against his girlfriend's brother.\n[20] I disagree with the appellant's arguments. The burden is on him to rebut the presumption of state protection. The evidence that he provided shows that women who bear children out of wedlock face discrimination, based on women's premarital chastity.7 As noted by the RPD, the news articles produced by the appellant demonstrate that perpetrators of honour crimes against men have been arrested, detained or even sentenced to prison terms. I added that the articles are about men who were caught in the act and perpetrators who had an immediate and spontaneous reaction, which is not the case for the appellant. The fact that the appellant is able to identify his agent of risk is not insignificant. Filing a complaint about death threats from a drug trafficker is no small matter. Fearing that the police will not assist him, in these circumstances, is not reasonable. No evidence was submitted by the appellant other than social condemnation of women who have had relations outside marriage. His argument that relations outside marriage are prohibited in Algeria and, consequently, subject to state penalties, was not provided. I agree with the RPD that the fears raised by the appellant for not having at least attempted to seek state protection are founded on speculative subjective fears. I would add that the appellant's perception may be sincere, even though satisfactory evidence for his arguments cannot be established on a balance of probabilities. The RPD's conclusion is correct.\nFailure to provide reasons and to formulate clear conclusions\n[21] The appellant argues that the RPD failed to provide reasons and to formulate clear conclusions. In passing, he cites case law stating that \"the reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible that the claimant may know why his claim has failed and decide whether to seek leave to appeal, where necessary.\"8 He argues that the panel ignored essential evidence establishing the appellant's prospective risk, namely the newspaper articles he filed to show that honour crimes are frequent in Algeria, although the National Documentation Package on the country lacks sufficient information concerning such crimes. He reiterates that he risks suffering the same fate should he return to Algeria.\n[22] I disagree with the appellant. The reasons raised by the RPD are based on section 97 of the IRPA.9 He attempted to prove that he cannot avail himself of state protection due to the various fears raised. Each fear was fully analyzed by the RPD. He clearly fears his ex-girlfriend's brother. However, insofar as the brother first attempted to harm him in XXXX 2019 and attacked him in XXXX 2019, the door is open to ask the police to intervene, especially since the attacker has been identified. That is the crux of the reason why the appellant failed in his claim. The evidence submitted does not meet the balance of probabilities threshold. The fact that the appellant lived without any problems from XXXX to XXXX 2019 (more than five months) does not demonstrate the fear that prompted him to seek protection in Canada. Accordingly, the reasons stated by the RPD are intelligible, clear and precise for the purpose of understanding that the appellant did not provide evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that the Algerian state would not have responded to his request for protection. The RPD's reasons are well articulated and, in my view, the crux of the decision is based on this lack of evidence and on the evidence that establishes the willingness of the Algerian state to protect its citizens.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD's determination that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nCharles Gauthier\nCharles Gauthier\nFebruary 15, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.

She is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting her refugee protection claim.\n[2] Ms. XXXX XXXX fears persecution from her husband in Mexico. She survived an abusive relationship with this man for over twenty years and fled the domestic violence in 2015. She alleges that her husband continued to harass her and went to her house in 2019, attempting to attack her. She left her house after this incident and came to Canada shortly after.\n[3] The RPD found that Ms. XXXX XXXXwas credible about being in an abusive relationship up to the time she separated from her husband in 2015, but not about any subsequent incidents with her husband, based on omissions in her evidence as well as vague and inconsistent testimony about what happened in 2019. The RPD concluded that, based on her profile as a single woman, she could return safely to Mexico.\n[4] Ms. XXXX XXXXargues that the RPD erred in assessing the credibility of her allegations of her husband's continued violence after 2015, mainly by failing to consider her profile as a vulnerable victim of domestic violence. She submits that the RPD should have considered her past trauma when assessing the quality of her testimony. She also argues that the RPD should have applied the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board (Guideline on Gender Considerations) when analyzing her memory problems.\n[5] I allow this appeal and I am referring the claim back to a differently constituted RPD panel for redetermination.1\nANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\nChairperson's Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations2\n[6] The Chairperson's Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations must be considered in appropriate cases. It is incumbent on Immigration and Refugee Board decision-makers to exhibit the knowledge required and to apply it in an understanding, fulsome and sensitive manner when deciding issues relating to individuals fearing gender-related persecution.\n[7] The RPD member stated that he considered the Guideline on Gender Considerations during the hearing and in his assessment of whether Ms. XXXX XXXX, as a survivor of domestic violence prior to her separation in 2015, had a profile as a single woman that could sustain her refugee protection claim.\n[8] Ms. XXXX XXXXargues that the RPD did not properly consider the Gender Guideline when assessing the quality of her testimony and her profile as a vulnerable survivor of domestic violence.\n[9] In my analysis of the testimony and the evidence on the record, I also took into account the Guideline on Gender Considerations and the fact that Ms. XXXX XXXXis a survivor of long-term domestic violence and abuse. I agree with Ms. XXXX XXXXthat the RPD erred by not assessing her allegations and testimony through the lens of the Guideline on Gender Considerations and that this error tainted the assessment of her credibility.\nStandard of review\n[10] When reviewing the RPD decision, I am required to independently assess all the evidence and determine whether the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error. I may defer to the RPD in the exceptional situation that I find it had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances, and reasons will be provided in that situation.3 To be clear, this is not the situation in this case.\n[11] After conducting my own analysis of the evidence on the record, including reading a transcript of the RPD hearing, I agree with Ms. XXXX XXXXthat the RPD made errors in analyzing her credibility by not properly applying the Guideline on Gender Considerations.\nCredibility\n[12] The RPD found that Ms. XXXX XXXXhad not credibly established that her husband continued to approach and harass her after she left him in 2015 because:\n* Her testimony on all the post-2015 allegations was vague and inconsistent with the written account in her Basis of Claim Form.\n* Specifically, in her written account, Ms. XXXX XXXXfails to mention that she had gone to live with her parents after leaving her husband, that her husband had been to their house between 2015 and 2019 and that he had made threats and insulted her father. She testified about this during the hearing, but these allegations are absent from her written account. She explained that she had forgotten to mention this, but the RPD found this explanation unreasonable.\n* There were inconsistencies between the description in Ms. XXXX XXXXwritten account and her testimony about the incident in 2019 when her husband went to her house, which was the incident that prompted her to flee the country. One inconsistency was whether she fled at night or in the morning, another was whether her husband went once or twice to the house, and finally another was whether he was armed with a machete. She explained that she is sometimes confused but the RPD found her testimony murky.\n[13] Ms. XXXX XXXXargues that the RPD erred in the above-mentioned credibility assessment as it did not consider her profile as a vulnerable survivor of domestic violence and how the trauma of her history of abuse might affect her memory and the quality of her testimony. She submits that the RPD did not properly consider the Guideline on Gender Considerations with respect to her memory problems and the quality of her testimony.\n[14] Ms. XXXX XXXXalso argues that the RPD focused on secondary inconsistencies and that it is understandable that after all the abuse she suffered over the years that she would forget or confuse certain details, adding that she does not have a high level of education.\n[15] Finally, Ms. XXXX XXXXpoints to a bit of confusion that occurred at the beginning of the hearing about whether or not the RPD had received her amended written account and argues that this added to her nervousness and lack of clarity during the hearing.\n[16] In my opinion, Ms. XXXX XXXXis correct to argue that the RPD erred in assessing her credibility. The RPD did not apply the Guideline on Gender Considerations with respect to her allegations and testimony before the RPD. Sections 7.5 and 7.6 of the Guideline on Gender Considerations are clear about how trauma can affect a person's memory and as a result, the quality of their testimony.4 I find that this error negatively affected the RPD's assessment of her credibility. More specifically, the RPD erred by failing to consider the how the trauma of being a survivor of years of domestic violence may have impacted her. I find that it is logical to conclude that her testimony before the RPD was affected by her vulnerability based on her past trauma.\n[17] As a result, I am not satisfied with the RPD's credibility assessment and find that it was incorrect, but also insufficient, to conclude that Ms. XXXX XXXXwas not credible about the harassment and threats she endured from her husband after she left him in 2015. I would add that at this point, the application of the Guideline on Gender Considerations becomes even more important for the assessment of this claim.\nProfile of a single woman\n[18] The RPD found that even after considering the Guideline on Gender Considerations, Ms. XXXX XXXXprofile as a single woman was not enough to sustain her claim and that she could safely return to Mexico.\n[19] Ms. XXXX XXXXargues that the RPD should have considered her not only a single woman, but also a vulnerable single woman with a history of trauma returning to Mexico.\n[20] Once again, I agree with Ms. XXXX XXXXthat the RPD erred in its assessment of her profile and did not fully engage with what she endured and the life she lived due to her violent husband.\n[21] With this in mind, the problem in my view is that not enough questions were put to Ms. XXXX XXXXabout her prospective risk, based on her profile as a vulnerable survivor of long-term abuse and, more specifically, about the adequacy of state protection and the possibility of an internal flight alternative (IFA).\n[22] These two issues were addressed briefly during the hearing: Ms. XXXX XXXXstated that she filed a complaint once with the police, but that they did not do anything other than discuss the situation merely as a family matter, when asked whether she could settle in Mexico City. She replied that her husband had people looking for her, without elaborating. In my opinion, there is not enough evidence on these two issues for me to form a proper conclusion, and I believe she deserves a chance to elaborate on these issues in a full hearing of these matters.\n[23] While I consider that the RPD decision must be set aside because of errors referred to above in the credibility assessment, I cannot draw my own conclusions as to whether Ms. XXXX XXXXis a refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[24] I cannot substitute my own decision for that of the RPD without hearing the testimony given before the RPD. Therefore, the case should be referred back to the RPD.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] I allow this appeal and am referring the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXXback to a differently constituted RPD panel for redetermination.5\nDIRECTIONS\n[26] Further questions must be put to Ms. XXXX XXXXabout her prospective risk, including the adequacy of state protection and the possibility of an IFA elsewhere in Mexico, away from the area where her husband lives.\n(signed)\nJulie Corry\nMember's name\nJune 15, 2023\nDate of amended decision\nMay 11, 2023\nDate of original decision\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended (IRPA), paragraph 111(1)(c).\n2 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), Chairperson's Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, effective November 13, 1996, revised in July 2022.

The appellants left Haiti for Chile in XXXX 2017 after an attack by rebels motivated by the male appellant's support for the Parti ha\u00eftien Tet Kal\u00e9 (PHTK) in XXXX 2015. With no possibility of obtaining a work permit, and after experiencing discrimination as foreigners in Chile, they left the country in XXXX 2021 and arrived in the United States in XXXX 2021, before travelling to Canada in XXXX 2022.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concluded that the appellants have an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Port-au-Prince.\n[3] The appellants are arguing that the RPD erred in the analysis of the male appellant's testimony. They submit that the RPD erred with regard to the IFA and that refuge in Port-au-Prince would be [translation] \"suicidal.\"\n[4] The determinative issues for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) are credibility, the IFA and protection from the Haitian state.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The appeal is allowed. I substitute the RPD's determination with my own determination that the appellants XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees. Their allegations are credible. They would face a serious possibility of persecution if they returned to XXXX but do not have a viable IFA in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie because of the undue hardship and great physical danger they would face in order to get there. They cannot avail themselves of adequate state protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The appellants are submitting a statement from XXXX XXXX, a lawyer in Haiti.\nThe evidence presented by the appellants is rejected\n[7] To be admissible, new evidence must meet at least one of the three criteria in subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). If at least one of these requirements is met, the appellants must establish that the new evidence meets the case law criteria of credibility, newness and relevance.1\n[8] The letter is dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022, that is, after the refugee protection claim was rejected on October 26, 2022. The events described in the first and last paragraphs occurred before the claim was rejected. The male appellant has not explained why they were not reasonably available before the claim was rejected, and I see no reason why he could not have obtained this information in order to present it before the RPD. The RAD is not an opportunity to complete a deficient record.\n[9] The events recounted in the second paragraph about the socio-political and security situation and the killing of police officers by gangs operating in Port-au-Prince are events that occurred both before the refugee protection claim was rejected and after the claim was rejected in XXXX 2022. However, even if I consider that these events meet the first criterion, they do not meet the newness criterion, since the issue of gangs in Port-au-Prince is documented in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Haiti.2 The killing of Divisional Commissioner Rigaud on November 25, 2022, meets the first criterion of 110(4). The information is not new, since the killing of police officers and magistrates is unfortunately a reality in Haiti3 and was known at the time of the hearing.\nNOTICE TO THE PARTIES\n[10] On February 27, 2023, in accordance with Alazar, the RAD notified the appellants and the Minister of its intention to address new issues about the risk, should they return to Haiti, at the hands of the criminals who attacked the male appellant in 2017, and whether the Haitian authorities can provide them with adequate protection. The RPD proposed Port-au-Prince as an IFA. The RAD is instead considering an IFA in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.\n[11] On March 13, 2023, the appellants filed submissions within the prescribed time limit. The Minister had not filed any additional submissions as of the time these reasons were signed. The Minister did not ask to intervene.\nThe new evidence further to the Refugee Appeal Division's notice is rejected\n[12] The appellants submit a news article dated October 5, 2019, by Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. They do not explain how this new evidence meets the requirements of rule 29 of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules) or those of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and the jurisprudential criteria.\n[13] The article filed by the appellants in response to the RAD's notice is rejected because it does not meet the criteria of the RAD Rules. Although it is relevant and has probative value, it provides no new evidence to this appeal, as the information it relates is in the NDP. Moreover, with reasonable effort the appellants could have submitted it with their appeal record, since the violence in Port-au-Prince, the IFA proposed by the RPD, was a determinative issue. They do not explain why they were unable to present this article from the Internet with their appeal record.\nANALYSIS\n[14] My role is to examine all of the evidence, including listening to the hearing,4 and to establish whether the RPD's decision is correct.5\nThe Refugee Protection Division erred in choosing Port-au-Prince as an internal flight alternative\n[15] The appellants submit that they have discharged their burden of proving that their lives would be at risk from the people who attacked them if they returned to Haiti, that this country is rife with heinous crimes where vengeance and gangs are rampant, and that no one would advise a person to walk into the lion's den in Port-au-Prince, the stronghold of all these organizations.\n[16] I accept the appellants' arguments. Considering the documentary evidence on the situation in Port-au-Prince,6 with the clashes between rival gang members forcing thousands of Haitians to relocate to flee the violence, I consider that this city will be no less hostile for the appellants than their hometown of XXXX. For this reason, I asked them to make their submissions on the possibility of relocating to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, two cities located across from their hometown of XXXX, on Haiti's southwestern peninsula.\nThe appellants would face a serious possibility of persecution in XXXX\n[17] The RPD found that for the purposes of the IFA assessment, the appellants' allegations were credible, except for the reasons for the murder of his cousin and his wife in XXXX 2022.\n[18] The appellants submit that the RPD did not consider all of the testimony in its decision, did not take into account the presumption of truthfulness for his testimony and did not provide rigorous arguments in its reasons. They are disputing that, on the one hand, the RPD stated that it was prepared to believe the circumstances of the assault in XXXX 2017 but, on the other hand, was not prepared to believe the reason for the murders of the cousin and his wife, when the male appellant testified that the murder was related to his membership in the PHTK party.\n[19] The RPD erred in concluding that it did not believe the male appellant when he stated that his cousin had been murdered for the same reasons as him. It did not have sufficient reasons to reject this part of his testimony and did not apply the presumption of truthfulness in Maldonado.7\n[20] The RPD found all of the male appellant's allegations about what happened in 2017 to be credible. It could not simply conclude that it did not believe the story about his cousin. I am aware that refugee protection claimants must state all the important information in their Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) or risk having their credibility questioned, and the appellants did not mention this event in their initial BOC Form. However, I draw no negative inference from the omission at the hearing since the male appellant amended his BOC Form at the very beginning of the hearing and this is the only omission or inconsistency in his testimony.\n[21] The fact that his cousin was killed by individuals because of his involvement with the PHTK corroborates the fact that this type of crime still existed in XXXX in 2022 and that if the male appellant were to return to XXXX, he could once again be targeted by the killers who might recognize him after hearing rumours of his return, or cross paths with him while he is living there.\nThe appellants could live safely in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie\n[22] Although the appellants have established a serious possibility of persecution in XXXX, they must establish that they could not live safely in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.\n[23] The RPD concluded that the appellants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of persecution are motivated to search for them throughout Haiti and to locate them in the city of Port-au-Prince, that it is unlikely that the male appellant could still be of interest to the unidentified individuals who assaulted him in XXXX 2017, that they did not attack him afterwards while he was still in the country, and that five years have passed.\n[24] The RPD's conclusion is correct. After conducting my independent analysis of the evidence, I conclude that the appellants have not established that the alleged agents of persecution would have the motivation and would try to find them elsewhere in the country.\n[25] Even if the alleged agents of persecution had the means to find the appellants through their network or by word of mouth, they must establish on a balance of probabilities that they have the motivation to find them in the proposed IFAs.\n[26] Their family members still live in XXXX and XXXX, and the agents of persecution have never gone after them, even though the documentary evidence indicates that criminals may attack the family members of a wanted person to pressure them or take revenge.\n[27] The male appellant did not state that his cousin was murdered because of him, but for a similar reason, namely his political support for the PHTK.\n[28] The passage of time is also a factor that must be taken into account. The initial events took place in 2017, six years ago. In this kind of situation, an attack motivated by a person's political opinion, with no evidence to support a conclusion that the agents of persecution are still looking for them or have tried to seek revenge, the passage of time is an additional element and supports the conclusion that the alleged agents of persecution are unlikely to have the motivation to find the appellants if they relocated to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.\n[29] The appellants submit that the RPD erred in concluding that the male appellant had returned to live at his home between the assault and his departure from the country, and that he was not attacked during this period. On the contrary, he testified that he had lived at his parents' home and only at his parents' home, that he was living in hiding, and that he rarely left the house, taking precautions such as hiring a nurse for his care in order to avoid exposing himself by going to the hospital and to avoid being recognized by the assailants.\n[30] The RPD's conclusion is correct. Although the appellant did not leave his house before he left Haiti, he alleges that the agents of persecution are dangerous criminals and that they would be motivated to go after him if he returned to Haiti six years after the events. Given the danger posed by gangs in Haiti, I consider it likely that if they had wanted to go after him, they could have done so between the XXXX 2017 attack and his departure on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They did not do so, which is the most important detail and is indicative of their lack of interest. The simple fact that he did not leave his home while staying with his parents is not sufficient to explain that there was no attack. It is more likely than not that already in 2017, the agents of persecution were no longer motivated to go after the male appellant. They had several months to do so, but did not.\n[31] The appellants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that their agents of persecution would have the motivation to look for them if they relocated to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. Therefore, they could live there safely.\nAn internal flight alternative in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie is unreasonable\n[32] The RPD concluded that the appellants had stated they had no problems other than with these individuals, that they stated they would have no problems moving to Port-au-Prince and that, consequently, they did not establish that the proposed IFA would be objectively unreasonable.\n[33] The appellants submit that the RPD erred in not conducting an objective analysis of the situation in Haiti, that it merely stated that Haiti is a country where many sordid and unsolved crimes unfortunately occur and that it preferred not to believe the possibility that the cousin's murder was linked to the PHTK. They submit that if they return to Haiti, the male appellant will have to work, which will put him at risk of being recognized by his assailants. They submit that the RPD did not take the time to analyze all the evidence to determine whether there is a well-founded and current fear.\n[34] Further to the RAD's notice, the appellants submit that it would be unreasonable for them to relocate to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie because of the political, economic and social context and that, to do so, they would have to fly from Montr\u00e9al to Port-au-Prince and then drive. They explain that they will have to go through the Martissant zone, an area infested by gangs that extort and loot the population, that this district of Port-au-Prince has tipped over into total chaos, a gang war, a [translation] \"lawless zone, symbol of the collapse of the state\" as headlined in a local newspaper, and that police officers have deserted the area's police stations. They submit that the cities of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Les Cayes have not been spared this insecurity. They add that the relocation of migrants returning to Haiti after a prolonged stay abroad is difficult.\n[35] I have already concluded that the RPD erred in proposing an IFA in Port-au-Prince, because it failed to take into account the documentary evidence on the situation in that city. I have proposed two other cities as IFAs, located far away from the northeastern part of the country where the appellants are from. The question now is whether it would be reasonable for them to settle there, and whether these cities are accessible.\n[36] According to the case law, the assessment of the second prong of the IFA test is based on whether, in all the circumstances, it would be reasonable for the appellants to move to the proposed IFAs, or in other words: would it be unduly harsh to expect them to move to another, less hostile part of Haiti before seeking refugee status in Canada? The burden is on the appellants to establish this.\n[37] Although the appellants have presented little or no evidence on the situation in Haiti, and in particular in the cities of Les Cayes and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, I cannot rely solely on the fact that they have not discharged their burden8 and disregard the documentary evidence in the NDP on the situation in Haiti.\n[38] According to the case law, an IFA is not speculative or theoretical, but must be a realistic, attainable option. In particular, a refugee protection claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there.9\nAn IFA cannot be speculative or theoretical only; it must be a realistic, attainable option. Essentially, this means that the alternative place of safety must be realistically accessible to the claimant. Any barriers to getting there should be reasonably surmountable. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or in staying there. For example, claimants should not be required to cross battle lines where fighting is going on at great risk to their lives in order to reach a place of safety. [emphasis added]\n[39] The appellants have established that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in XXXX due to the male appellant's imputed political opinion. Their relocation to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie is unreasonable because they cannot be required to risk their lives to reach this place of safety, given the current situation in Haiti and the control of the main roads, particularly the one leading to Martissant. The IFA is not a \"realistic, attainable\" option or \"realistically accessible\" for the appellants, given that the main roadways linking Port-au-Prince to other regions of the country are controlled by criminal gangs. This conclusion is based on the following documentary analysis:\n[40] An article dated February 202210 from The New Humanitarian news agency analyzes the impact of gang violence on the mobility of goods and people in Haiti. A map shows that the Port-au-Prince area, the airport area, is surrounded by gang-controlled zones, including the roads through Martissant to the western and southern parts of the country, where J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Les Cayes are located.11 Another map shows that the J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Les Cayes areas are served by sea due to road blockages.12\n[41] An article from March 2022 published by the Human Rights Watch organization on Haitians being returned to a country in chaos13 confirms that the road linking Port-au-Prince to Haiti's southern peninsula to the west is gang-controlled, separating the four southern provinces from the rest of the country. In July and August 2021, no fewer than 23 people were killed by gangs while driving in private vehicles in the Martissant area.14 The road passing through the Martissant neighbourhood and connecting to the south of the country has been dangerous since criminal groups have been fighting for control of the territory. With regard to sea access, it is accessible only to state employees and those with the means.15\n[42] The gang-controlled access routes are not the only aspect making IFAs elsewhere in the country realistically inaccessible. In a Response to Information Request from 2020, various sources indicate16 that migrants returning from Canada are entering gang-controlled areas and are at high risk of being kidnapped and that freedom of movement is not guaranteed because of the armed gangs. Considering the growing gang problem in Haiti in 2023, it is reasonable to think that this is still true, especially since there is an upswing in cases of kidnappings in gang-controlled areas.17\n[43] With regard to the female appellant in particular, the evidence shows that gang members commit [translation] \"opportunistic\" rapes or kidnappings of women when they are travelling on public transit in all sectors of Port-au-Prince.18\n[44] According to Haiti Situation Report: Gang-related political violence and kidnappings, January 2022,19 gang-related violence has continued to increase due to the worsening security situation and the growing power of the gangs, that kidnappings for ransom are likely to double or triple, that it has become clear that gangs will target anyone who could be used for a lucrative ransom, and that murders are likely to increase also. With regard to the movement of valuable goods, the Insecurity Insight organization recommends that humanitarian organizations plan their routes and notify key stakeholders in advance, including the gangs. According to some sources, the criminal groups are now increasingly targeting \"everyone\" since they encounter less resistance while remaining confident that the family members will endeavour to pay.20\n[45] The appellants cannot return to the XXXX area due to the risk of persecution they would face. They cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship to get to Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. The NDP contains substantial evidence with regard to the risks they would face to reach the proposed IFAs; they would be risking their lives to reach a place of safety by crossing regions controlled by armed gangs, which makes an IFA in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie unreasonable.\nHaitian state protection is inadequate\n[46] The documentary evidence in the NDP21 demonstrates in a clear and convincing manner that there is no adequate protection in Haiti. The effectiveness of the police force is inadequate, given the crime rate, the lack of resources and means, and the corruption. Several sources state that the criminal groups enjoy impunity. As for the judiciary, it lacks oversight and is under the influence of criminal groups.22\n[47] State protection and political structures are inadequate and there is a rampant lack of resources to address the high crime rate throughout the country, which establishes that the appellants would not have adequate state protection in Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[48] The RPD made errors that I have corrected in this appeal. The male appellant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in XXXX because of his imputed political opinion. The female appellant is a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, and the evidence establishes that armed gangs go after the families of their targets. For these reasons, the appellants have established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to Haiti, to the XXXX area. They have no viable IFA in Les Cayes or J\u00e9r\u00e9mie nor elsewhere in the country because of the undue risk to their lives in getting there. State protection is inadequate.\nDECISION\n[49] The appeal is allowed. I substitute the determination of the RPD with my own determination that the appellants XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees.\n(signed)\nMe Agn\u00e8s Connat\nMe Agn\u00e8s Connat\nMarch 31, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The Punjab police falsely accused him of having ties to gangsters after he took in two friends suspected of gangsterism by the police. The appellant also fears for his life at the hands of the Indian police because he has joined a separatist Sikh movement (Sikhs for Justice) since arriving in Canada.\n[3] The appellant is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his refugee protection claim. He argues that the RPD erred in finding that he was not credible with respect to his profile as a separatist Sikh activist and the Punjab police's ongoing interest in him. He also argues that the RPD erred in concluding that an internal flight alternative (IFA) is available to him in New Delhi.\n[4] For the reasons set out below, I conclude that the RPD's decision is correct. The appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to some of his allegations. I also conclude that an IFA is available to him in New Delhi.\n[5] The appeal is dismissed.\nANALYSIS\n[6] I applied the correctness standard.1 As required, I conducted an independent analysis of the evidence, which included listening to the recording of the RPD hearing.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in its credibility assessment\nThe appellant's political profile\n[7] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant failed to demonstrate that, if he returned to India, he would be politically active regarding Khalistan or that he would face a risk of persecution by reason of his political opinion.\n[8] The appellant argues that his failure to spontaneously mention that he fears returning to India because of his support for Khalistan is not as egregious as the RPD described. He submits that the RPD erred in relying on the omission to make a negative credibility finding. He adds that the RPD did not provide adequate reasons for its finding and that its decision is not transparent.\n[9] I disagree.\n[10] I am of the opinion that the RPD's reasons are clear and explain why the RPD concluded that the appellant did not demonstrate that he truly intends to support Khalistan if he returns to India. The RPD relied on the appellant's failure to mention during his testimony that he fears returning to India because he is a Khalistan supporter. The RPD also relied on contradictions in the appellant's testimony as to when he became a Khalistan supporter and whether he was merely a supporter or a member of an organization.\n[11] I also conducted my own independent analysis of the evidence. For the reasons set out below, I conclude that the appellant did not demonstrate that he is politically active in a separatist Sikh movement or that he will be perceived as such if he returns to India.\nFailure to mention that he fears returning because of his political opinion\n[12] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in making a negative credibility finding based on the appellant's failure to mention during his testimony that he also fears returning to India because he supports Khalistan, a movement seeking the creation of an independent Sikh state.\n[13] I am of the opinion that, contrary to what the appellant argues, his failure to spontaneously mention his pro-Khalistan activism at the hearing when he was asked why he fears returning to India constitutes a major omission.\n[14] Approximately ten (10) days before his RPD hearing, the appellant took the opportunity to make additions to his Basis of Claim Form2 (BOC Form). In this addendum, he states that he is a Khalistan supporter. At the same time, the appellant also submitted documents described as evidence of his pro-Khalistan activities,3 namely, photographs showing him with other individuals of the Sikh faith4 and a voter card for the referendum on Khalistan issued by the Sikhs for Justice organization.5\n[15] However, when the RPD asked him whether there were any reasons other than the false accusations of ties to gangsters why the police might arrest him if he returned to India, the appellant simply stated that Sikhs in India are considered terrorists. When the RPD asked him to explain why the police considers them to be terrorists, the appellant stated that it was because of the Hindu government, which despises Sikhs, makes false accusations against them and imprisons them.6 At no point did the appellant mention that he is a Khalistan supporter or that he will be targeted for that reason if he returns to India.\n[16] I have taken into consideration that the appellant expressed a fear of returning to India because of how Sikhs are treated by the Indian government. I will come back to this. That said, it should be noted that there is a difference between a fear of returning based on religion, namely, the practice of Sikhism, and one based on a separatist political opinion. Although one does not exclude the other, not all Sikhs advocate for Khalistan.7\n[17] However, it was only when the RPD pointed out to him that, in his addendum to the BOC Form, he states that he is a supporter of Khalistan that the appellant confirmed that he fears returning to India for that reason as well. When the RPD asked why he had not spontaneously mentioned this, the appellant's response was vague and evasive. At first, he stated that he had not been able to say so. He added that the police had harassed him a great deal and that he feared them. The RPD had to press for an answer to its question. Again, the appellant did not answer the question. Instead, he stated that he has been pro-Khalistan since arriving in Canada. When again asked to explain the omission, the appellant stated that he found out about it later and repeated the reasons that led him to leave India.8\n[18] I draw a negative inference from the appellant's vague and evasive testimony.\n[19] I have also taken into account that, according to the appellant's testimony later during the hearing, the police in India kill Khalistan supporters, that he himself is prepared to die for his political opinion and that he is very involved in the movement in Canada.9\n[20] In this context, I would have expected the appellant to spontaneously state that he feared returning to India because he is a Khalistan supporter. However, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that his credibility is greatly undermined with respect to his allegations that he actively supports Khalistan and that he would support it if he returned to India.\nContradictions regarding the circumstances surrounding his political activities\n[21] I am also of the opinion that the RPD did not err in making negative credibility findings based on the contradictions as to when the appellant became a Khalistan supporter and whether he was a mere supporter or a member of a pro-Khalistan organization.\n[22] According to his BOC Form, the appellant is a Khalistan supporter.10\n[23] As the RPD noted, the appellant's testimony was contradictory as to when he became a Khalistan supporter. His testimony was also contradictory with respect to his status, that is, whether he is a supporter or a member of a pro-Khalistan organization. When asked to explain the contradictions, the appellant adjusted his testimony more than once.\n[24] At the RPD hearing, the appellant stated that he has been a Khalistan supporter since 2019.11 Later during the hearing, the appellant stated that he became a supporter after attending a pro-Khalistan rally in 2018 in Surrey, British Columbia.12 He then stated that he had taken part in the rally because he is pro-Khalistan. The appellant later adjusted his testimony. He stated that he became a supporter when he moved to Cambridge, Ontario. When the RPD asked him to explain the contradiction, the appellant stated that he fully supported Khalistan after his arrival in Ontario. The appellant later adjusted his testimony to state that he became an active member after 2019. He explained that to become a member, he had obtained an identity card that allowed him to vote. The appellant had trouble specifying which organization he had become a member of. He first stated that he was a member of Khalistan and that he had obtained an identity card13 to that effect. When asked to specify the organization in which the identity card confers membership, the appellant stated the creation of Khalistan. When confronted with the fact that the card was issued by the Sikhs for Justice organization, the appellant stated that the goal was the creation of Khalistan. When asked whether he is a member of Sikhs for Justice, the appellant answered in the affirmative. When asked to explain why he had not mentioned this earlier, the appellant stated because the RPD had not asked him.14 I am of the opinion that the RPD's questions as to which organization the appellant had become a member of were clear and unambiguous.\n[25] According to the appellant's testimony, after 2019, he became particularly active in the Khalistan movement, notably by encouraging other Sikhs in Canada to join the movement. In such circumstances and in a context where the appellant is seeking protection because of his political activities, among other things, I would have expected the appellant to be able to state clearly when he joined the movement, what his status was, that is, whether he was a mere supporter or a member, and the name of the organization of which he had allegedly become a member.\n[26] In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that the appellant's credibility is further undermined with respect to his political profile.\n[27] I took into consideration the voter card issued by Sikhs for Justice.15 Considering that the appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to his political profile, I give no probative value to the document to corroborate the appellant's allegations that he took part in pro-Khalistan rallies.\n[28] There is no evidence before me that such a voter card is issued solely to people taking part in pro-Khalistan rallies. All that the voter card establishes is that it was issued to the appellant so that he can vote in a referendum.\n[29] I have taken into consideration that the recent documentary evidence shows that the Indian authorities monitor Khalistan activists abroad, such as at rallies and on social media.16 However, the appellant did not demonstrate that he has this profile.\n[30] Furthermore, the objective documentary evidence17 does not establish that the mere fact of obtaining a voter card issued by Sikhs for Justice could come to the attention of the Indian authorities.\n[31] I took into consideration the photographs submitted by the appellant to demonstrate that he had taken part in pro-Khalistan activities.18 However, I see nothing in those photographs that provides a basis to conclude that the appellant had attended one or more pro-Khalistan rallies. The photographs merely show the appellant with other individuals wearing Sikh religious symbols. I accept that, in Canada, the appellant spends time with other people who practise Sikhism. That being said, the photographs are insufficient to corroborate the appellant's political activities. Consequently, I grant them no probative value to corroborate the appellant's allegations that he advocates for Khalistan in Canada.\n[32] In light of all the foregoing, I find that the appellant's credibility was undermined as to his allegations of pro-Khalistan activism in Canada. I also find that his credibility was undermined with respect to his allegations that he would advocate for Khalistan if he returned to India. Although the appellant obtained a voter card allowing him to vote in a referendum on Khalistan, the appellant did not demonstrate that this evidence alone provides a basis to conclude that he had come to the attention of the Indian authorities because of his political opinion.\n[33] Consequently, I conclude that the appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution by reason of his real or perceived political profile or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) if he returned to India.\nOngoing interest of the police\n[34] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in finding that the appellant's credibility was undermined as to his allegations that the XXXX XXXX police are still looking for him.\n[35] The appellant argues that the RPD erred in giving no weight to the affidavits of his brother and a municipal councillor, which state that the police are still looking for him.19 He also seems to argue that the RPD erred when it rejected his explanations that he was no longer in contact with his brother and that he has very recently reconnected with his cousin.\n[36] I conducted my own analysis.\n[37] I note that it was only around ten (10) days before the hearing that the appellant added to his BOC Form that his brother had told him in XXXX 2022 that the police were still looking for him and even visited the home of a family member to find out his whereabouts.20 However, at the RPD hearing, the appellant stated that he had been in touch with his brother approximately twice a month from the time he arrived in Canada in 2017 to 2022. In his conversations with his brother, his brother told him that the police were still looking for him, were harassing the family and wanted money. According to his testimony, the police initially visited two or three times per month. Later, it was monthly.21\n[38] However, in the first version of his BOC Form drafted in 2019,22 two years after his arrival in Canada, the appellant does not mention those numerous police visits. When asked to explain the omission, the appellant's response was vague and evasive, that, essentially, the police had never stopped looking for him. When the RPD pressed for an answer, the appellant stated that he did not know that he had to include that information in his BOC Form.23 I draw a negative inference from the vague and evasive testimony. I am of the opinion that the explanation is not satisfactory. The appellant was represented by counsel when he completed his BOC Form. He completed it nearly two years after arriving in Canada. Consequently, I am of the opinion that he had time to prepare himself. The police's constant harassment of family members is important information. It serves to demonstrate that even two years after the appellant's departure, the police were still actively looking for him.\n[39] In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that the appellant's credibility is greatly undermined as to his allegations of the police's ongoing interest.\n[40] I took into consideration the affidavits24 submitted by the appellant.\n[41] In his affidavit, the appellant's cousin states that he was contacted by the appellant's brother in 2017 who was seeking financial help.25 He then states that the police raided his home in search of the appellant.\n[42] At the RPD hearing, the appellant stated that he recently re-established contact with a cousin in India. The appellant was asked to explain what his cousin told him about the police. The appellant stated that his cousin told him that the police claim that he is a terrorist and that they are looking for him.26 The appellant made no mention of the raid in either his testimony or his BOC Form, which, in my view, is a major incident demonstrating the police's motivation. In addition, I am of the opinion that the appellant could not be unaware of that information because it is in his own documentary evidence.\n[43] When asked to explain the omission, the appellant's response was again vague and evasive. He testified that his cousin knew that the police were involved, that he did not know that they had gone to his home, but that he found out about it when he asked him for an affidavit.27 In my view, the appellant's explanation does not answer the question of why he failed to mention during his testimony that the police had raided his cousin's home.\n[44] In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, I find that the credibility of the affidavit is undermined. Furthermore, even if I accepted that the police had visited the appellant's cousin, the affidavit suggests that the incident happened in 2017. More than five (5) years have since passed. Consequently, the document is not sufficient to corroborate that the XXXX XXXXpolice are still looking for the appellant.\n[45] I also considered the XXXX XXXXmunicipal councillor's affidavit.28 He states that he was involved in the appellant's release in 2017. He also states that approximately two months before the drafting of his affidavit, the police had come to see him to question him about the appellant. However, considering that the appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to the police's continuing interest more than five years after he left India, I am of the opinion that the affidavit is insufficient to corroborate the appellant's allegations that the police are still looking for him.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in concluding that an internal flight alternative is available in New Delhi\n[46] The IFA assessment is based on a two-pronged test. For the first prong, the refugee protection claimant must establish a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA in the proposed IFAs. For the second prong, the refugee protection claimant must demonstrate that it would be objectively unreasonable for him to seek refuge in the proposed IFAs.\nThe appellant did not demonstrate that there is a prospective risk in New Delhi\n[47] I am of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the XXXX XXXXpolice in Punjab has the motivation to locate him in New Delhi. Consequently, I conclude that the appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution in New Delhi or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA in that location.\n[48] The appellant argues that the RPD erred in concluding that the XXXX XXXXpolice would not be motivated to look for him all the way to New Delhi. He submits that even if the police released him after receiving a bribe, extortion might be a motive for the XXXX XXXXpolice to conduct interstate searches to find him.\n[49] However, as mentioned above, the appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to his allegations of the police's continuing interest. The appellant did not demonstrate that the XXXX XXXXpolice have been interested in him since he left India in November 2017, over five years ago. The appellant does not allege that charges were officially laid against him. The appellant submitted no credible evidence that the police have been looking for him since he left India.\n[50] Consequently, regardless of the tenant verification system in India, given the passage of time and the absence of credible evidence that the police are still looking for him, I am of the opinion that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the police are still interested in him and that it has an interest in looking for him in New Delhi and the motivation to do so.\n[51] I also took into consideration how Sikhs are treated in New Delhi. I conclude that the appellant did not demonstrate that the treatment of Sikhs in New Delhi amounts to persecution.\n[52] As mentioned above, I am of the view that the appellant's credibility was undermined with respect to his allegations that he would face a risk of persecution in India because he openly supports Khalistan.\n[53] With respect to how Sikhs are treated, at the RPD hearing, the appellant testified that Sikhs in India are perceived as terrorists.\n[54] The objective documentary evidence29 mentions a rise in religious extremism in India, as well as waves of violence and religious persecution targeting religious minorities, including Sikhs, particularly pro-Khalistan supporters and activists. That said, the appellant did not demonstrate that he is a pro-Khalistan activist or that he is perceived as such. I am of the opinion that the evidence is insufficient to conclude that he risks being targeted in New Delhi because he is Sikh. The appellant is not a Sikh activist. He did not demonstrate that he is a real supporter of a political party advocating for Khalistan. According to the recent documentary evidence specifically on the treatment of Sikhs in India, most Sikhs living outside of Punjab generally do not have problems integrating economically and socially.30\n[55] I have also taken into consideration that the appellant previously lived and worked in New Delhi for around nineteen (19) years, until 2016.31 Although he states that he lost his job because someone paid to have his position, the appellant does not allege having had problems in New Delhi because he is of the Sikh faith.\n[56] In light of the foregoing and after considering all the evidence, I conclude that the appellant failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA in New Delhi.\nThe Refugee Protection Division did not err in concluding that it is not unreasonable for the appellant to seek refuge in New Delhi\n[57] The threshold for demonstrating that an IFA is unreasonable is very high. The conditions in the IFA must be such that the life or safety of the claimant would be at risk.32 I am of the opinion that the appellant did not discharge that burden.\n[58] The appellant argues that the RPD erred when it failed to explain why it accepted certain pieces of objective evidence over others. He adds that the RPD did not examine the documentary evidence in detail, including that which he had put forward. The appellant provides no other details about the documentary evidence that the RPD allegedly disregarded.\n[59] That said, I note that the counsel representing the appellant before the RPD referred to the objective documentary evidence on the treatment of people perceived as pro-Khalistan activists.33 However, as mentioned above, the appellant did not demonstrate that he has that profile.\n[60] At the RPD hearing, other than his fear of the XXXX XXXXpolice, the appellant mentioned no other reasons that would constitute an obstacle to his relocation. According to the appellant's testimony, the only reason why he could not live in New Delhi was that the police were looking for him. When asked by the RPD whether there were any other reasons that would prevent him from settling in New Delhi, the appellant answered in the negative.34\n[61] As mentioned above, the appellant does not allege that he had any problems when he was living in New Delhi.\n[62] The appellant is a 59-year-old man. He does not allege having health problems that would prevent him from working. I have taken into consideration that the appellant speaks only Punjabi. That said, Punjabi is among the predominant languages in Delhi, which includes New Delhi.35\n[63] In my view, the appellant did not demonstrate that he would be unable to support or house himself in New Delhi, a district of India's national capital.36\n[64] I have also taken into consideration that the appellant is of the Sikh faith. As mentioned above, according to the recent documentary evidence, most Sikhs living outside of Punjab generally live in safety, are not subjected to social discrimination or violence, and are able to integrate economically and socially.37 Delhi also has a large Sikh community.38\n[65] In light of the foregoing, and after considering all the evidence, I conclude that the RPD's decision is correct. The appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution on any of the five Convention grounds nor did he demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, should he return to India.\nDECISION\n[66] I dismiss the appeal. I confirm the determination of the RPD that XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMarie-Lyne Thibault\nMarie-Lyne Thibault\nAugust 21, 2023\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

They are appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated July 19, 2022, dismissing their claims for protection. The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in assessing their claims, and they ask the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow their appeals and determine that they are Convention1 refugees or persons in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),2 or to send the matter back to the RPD for redetermination.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Principal Appellant and his wife, the Associate Appellant, are from XXXX in the state of Haryana. They fear harm at the hands of XXXX XXXX (A.K.), a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in their village, because the Principal Appellant was a member of the Indian National Lok Dahl (INLD) party. In addition, the Appellants allege that they fear A.K. because of a dispute regarding agricultural land owned by the Principal Appellant and his family.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are not Convention refugees, and they are not persons in need of protection, in that their removal to India would not subject them personally to a risk to their lives, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\nTHE ROLE OF THE RAD\n[4] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.3 In doing so, I have carried out my own independent analysis of the RPD Record, including the RPD's reasons and decision and the transcript of the RPD hearing, to determine whether the RPD erred.\n[5] The RPD hearing was June 7, 2022 while the decision is dated July 19, 2022. The National Documentation Package (NDP) was updated on June 30, 2022. The Appellant's Record is dated September 9, 2022. Hence, the RAD assumes that the Appellant was aware of the updated NDP.4\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The Appellant does not request new evidence be admitted in this appeal. Owing to the fact that no new evidence has been admitted, I have no authority to hold a hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The RPD found that the determinative issue was the availability of an internal flight alternative (IFA) in New Delhi.\n[8] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred by:\n(a) making unreasonable negative credibility inferences; and\n(b) failing to properly assess the risk the Appellants would face on relocating to the proposed IFA.\n[9] I will assess the RPD's credibility findings in the context of Prong One of the IFA test. My assessment of the viability of an IFA for the Appellants will address their issue as to whether the RPD erred in failing to properly assess the risk they would face on relocating to New Delhi.\nWhether the RPD erred in finding that the Appellants have a viable IFA in New Delhi\n[10] Under the test, both prongs must be met once an IFA has been identified. The burden of proof is on the Appellants to establish that there is no IFA. In assessing an IFA, the Appellants' circumstances and profile must be taken into consideration. For the second prong, the Appellants must overcome a very high threshold to demonstrate that the IFA location is unreasonable by providing evidence that the Appellants' life and safety would be jeopardized by relocating to the proposed location.5 The Federal Court of Appeal has stated:\nWe read the decision of Linden J.A. for this Court as setting up a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.6\nWhether the RPD erred in finding that there was No Serious Risk of Harm under the First Prong of the Test\n[11] The first prong of the IFA test states that there must be a finding that there is no serious possibility that the Appellants will be persecuted in the proposed IFA or that the Appellants will not be personally subject to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, believed on substantial grounds to exist, in the IFA.\nRPD's findings\n[12] The RPD found that A.K. would not have the motivation to locate the Appellants in New Delhi because of the Principal Appellant's support for the INLD or the land dispute.\n[13] With respect to A.K.'s interest in the Appellants concerning their political affiliation with INLD, the RPD made a number of credibility findings.\n[14] First, the RPD inquired as whether the Principal Appellant was arrested when A.K. filed a First Information Report (FIR) against both him and his father. The Principal Appellant testified that, while his father was arrested, he was not because he was in hiding. The RPD drew a negative credibility inference because the address history in his immigration forms do not indicate he was in hiding.\n[15] Second, the RPD made a negative credibility inference because it asked why his father was acquitted of assault of A.K. and he answered because the court decided who was right and who was wrong. However, the RPD noted that the court decision read that A.K. could not identify who assaulted him. The RPD also drew another negative credibility inference because of the Principal Appellant's evolving testimony as he then testified that A.K. was pressured to withdraw the court case.\n[16] Third, the RPD drew a negative credibility inference owing to his evasive testimony by the Principal Appellant as to whether A.K. is searching for him.\n[17] The RPD drew a negative credibility inference concerning whether A.K. continues to pursue him because of his affiliation with INLD when he has been out of the country for a number of years, and the Principal Appellant responded that A.K. will pursue him because of a land dispute.\n[18] The RPD also found that the Appellants have not established that A.K. would pursue them in the proposed IFA owing to the land dispute. The RPD found that the Principal Appellant provided evasive responses to the issue of why A.K. would pursue the Appellants in New Delhi when his family that co-owns the property remain in the village.\n[19] The RPD noted that neither of two of affidavits from the Principal Appellant's father mention the land dispute. The RPD found that the Appellants provided no evidence of A.K. pursuing them, in particular, from XXXX 2018 to XXXX 2019 when they were in New Delhi.\n[20] The RPD also found that the BJP would not be interested in pursuing the Appellants in New Delhi because when the RPD asked the Principal Appellant why the BJP would be interested, he testified that A.K. is influential in the party. The RPD had already found that A.K. would not be motivated to track the Appellants in Delhi due to their political affiliation.\n[21] The RPD noted that INLD is a Haryana-based party with no presence in Delhi, and that Appellants have not established that they have a profile that would motivate BJP to search for them in New Delhi. It found that there is no evidence the BPJ would target the Appellants because of their support for INLD and minority-like parties.\n[22] The RPD found that the agents of persecution would not be able or have the means to locate Appellants in New Delhi through tenant registration system or the Aadhaar Card.\nAppellants' submissions\n[23] The Appellants submit that there is no discrepancy with respect to the Principal Appellant's testimony concerning his father's court case. They submit that the Principal Appellant's testimony was not evolving. The Principal Appellant's impression about what happened in court was, as the RPD noted, that \"the court looked at the situation and decided who is right and who is wrong\"7 as the court looked at the facts before them and served justice accordingly. The Appellant states that since the complainant did not identify the Appellant's father, there was no evidence based on which to convict, resulting in his father's acquittal. The Appellants state that the Principal Appellant explained that the village council had intervened, pressuring A.K. to drop the false charges against his father and his family. Given that the original FIR filed by A.K. identified the Appellant's father as one of his assailants, the Appellant's testimony provided a consistent and credible explanation as to why A.K. did not testify against his father in court.\n[24] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in finding the Principal Appellant's testimony evasive concerning whether A.K. is inquiring about him. The Appellants state that while the RPD asked when the last time was that A.K. had asked about the Principal Appellant and his response was that the inquiries are on-going. The Appellants state that the RPD never rephrased the question to ask when the \"most recent\" time was that A.K. had asked after the Appellant.\n[25] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in finding that A.K. would not be interested in him owing to his political affiliation with INLD as his father continued to live in the same village as A.K. and also supports INLD. However, the Appellants state that the Principal Appellant is a member of INLD, while his father was not, and he had a higher profile in the INLD. The Appellants also state that A.K. also has a grudge against the Principal Appellant.\n[26] The Appellants state that the RPD erred in not recognizing the Appellants are specially and specifically targeted by A.K. because of a grudge that went above and beyond his family's situation.\n[27] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred by relying on unreasonable credibility findings which affected elements central to their claims and therefore the RPD unreasonably diminished the perception of his forward-facing risk at the hands of A.K. and the BJP. The Appellants submit that this led the RPD to conclude that A.K. was not interested in searching for and harming the Appellants if they relocate to the proposed IFA.\nFindings\n[28] For the reasons below, I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the motivation to locate them in the proposed IFA. In my independent review of the evidence, I also find that the Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the means to locate them in New Delhi. To respond to the Appellants' \"Issue no. 1,\" I find that the RPD's credibility findings are correct with the exception of the finding pertaining to the inconsistency in the Principal Appellant's testimony and dates in their immigration forms. Although I found this specific finding was not correct, I find the RPD's overall findings are correct.\n[29] With respect to the Appellants' \"Issue No. 2,\" for the reasons below, I find that the RPD did not err by failing to properly assess the risk the Appellants would face on relocating to New Delhi.\nAgents of persecution motivation to pursue the Appellants in New Delhi (including Appellants' Issue No. 1 - Credibility findings)\nA.K.'s interest in the Appellant based on his political affiliation\n[30] I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants have not established that A.K. has a continuing interest in pursuing the Principal Appellant because of his political affiliation.\n[31] The Principal Appellant testified that one of the reasons he fears A.K. is because he belongs to the INLD party8 and he further testified that A.K. wants him to quit the party.9 However, the Principal Appellant has been in Canada since XXXX XXXX, 2019 and has not participated in any political activities in Haryana. The RPD asked the Principal Appellant why A.K. would be interested in him owing to the fact he has not worked for the INLD for over three years. The Principal Appellant testified that \"these conflicts are never ending because there is a strong amount of rivalry...\"10 I find that the RPD is correct in finding that the Principal Appellant's testimony is evasive and speculative considering that the Appellants have been out of the country for well-over three years, have not participated in any political activities in the state and have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. wants to continue the alleged \"rivalry\" or \"grudge\" such that he would seek the Appellants throughout India. I address the issue of the land dispute below.\n[32] I find that the RPD is correct in finding that the INLD, is a Haryana-based party and does not have a presence in New Delhi. The Appellants have not explained why A.K. would be motivated to seek them in New Delhi when the very reason he sought the Principal Appellant, that is, for his work on a rival party, would be absent.\n[33] I find that the RPD's negative credibility finding concerning the Appellants' allegation that A.K. wanted to harm them by filing an assault charge during the 2014 elections is correct. I also agree with the RPD that the alleged harm to the Principal Appellant and his father is central to the allegation that A.K. has a continuing interest to harm the Principal Appellant because of his political affiliation. A review of the Appellants' evidence shows that the Principal Appellant's testimony evolved as he was asked questions by the RPD.\n[34] The Principal Appellant testified that A.K. falsely accused his father of assaulting him but, with the assistance of his lawyer, his father was able to prove his innocence11 and that \"ultimately it was the lawyer and the judiciary that took a look at what had gone through and who is right, and who is wrong.\"12 However, the court document submitted by the Appellants stated that A.K. could not identify the persons who assaulted him.13 The RPD then asked why would A.K. withdraw his accusations against his father. The Principal Appellant stated because the village council pressured him to do so. The RPD asked why would A.K., if he is so important, be pressured by the village council, and the Principal Appellant replied that because the elders have to be respected. When asked why would not the village council help resolve the dispute with the Appellants and A.K, the Principal Appellant replied, \"Well, the thing is he just waits for the right chance - to click for him.\"14 I find that the Principal Appellant's testimony evolved by stating their lawyer worked to justify his father's innocence while the court documents indicate that A.K., the agent of persecution, withdrew his accusations against him, and then he added that the withdrawal was owing to pressure from the village council. I find it reasonable that, when asked initially by the RPD, the Principal Appellant would have explained that A.K. withdrew the charges owing to pressure from the village council.\n[35] I find that the RPD's negative credibility finding concerning inquiries as to the last time A.K. inquired about him is correct. Although the RPD made its finding on the basis that the Principal Appellant's testimony was evasive, I also find that Appellants have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. continues to pursue him.\n[36] The RPD asked the Principal Appellant twice in clear terms as to when the last time A.K. inquired about him. The Principal Appellant first replied that A.K. asked about him from 2000 to 2019 and he asks for him even at the present time. When asked again when the last time was, the Principal Appellant replied A.K. keeps asking for him. 15 The RPD asked a direct question and the Principal Appellant replied in a vague, evasive manner. I also note that Appellants' evidence as to the continuing interest by A.K. is similarly vague. The Appellants' amended Basis of Claim (BOC), which was extensively expanded from the Appellants' initial narrative, was submitted on May 30, 2022, a week before the RPD hearing. However, the amended BOC form states that since coming to Canada, A.K. continues to ask his father on a regular basis as to his whereabouts.16 Similarly, one of the affidavits sworn in 2022 submitted by the Principal Appellant's father states that, \"til date,\" members of the BJP ask about him.17 The other affidavit, dated also in 2022, states that A.K. and members of the BJP often inquire about the Principal Appellant and threaten him.18 Neither the Principal Appellant's testimony, despite the direct questions nor any of the documentary evidence, provide a single specific instance as to when A.K. sought out the Appellants since the Appellants have been in Canada. I find that the Principal Appellant's testimony and documentary evidence has a low probative value that A.K. has a continuing interest to seek the Appellants anywhere in India. Even if A.K. makes occasional inquiries, I find that the Appellants have not established he is interested in pursing the Appellants throughout India.\n[37] I do not agree with the Appellants' submission that the Principal Appellant's testimony was consistent owing to the nature of the RPD's questions. I disagree with Appellants' submission that the RPD should have asked the Principal Appellant when the most \"recent\" time A.K. inquired about him occurred. In my review of the transcript, the RPD asked a clear and direct question twice about the \"last\" time there was an inquiry and the Principal Appellant provided an evasive response.\n[38] I also note that there is no evidence that BJP remains interested in him. The RPD asked whether members of BJP \"in any time come to your house?\" The Principal Appellant responded in the negative.19 If A.K. has no interest in pursuing the Appellants throughout India, nor would the BJP be so interested.\n[39] I recognize that the RPD made a negative credibility inference concerning the inconsistency of the Principal Appellant's testimony and his immigration forms. The Principal Appellant testified that he was in hiding when his father was arrested yet his immigration forms do not reflect this testimony.20 The Appellants' counsel at the RPD hearing noted that the forms were never translated to the Appellants and they are unaware of the contents of the documents.21 The RPD asked why the Appellants would sign immigration forms that they did not know the contents and then asked questions pertaining to various dates in the forms that differ from the Principal Appellant's testimony, including his testimony that he started working for XXXX at age 11 in 2000 and owned his XXXX XXXX two years later.22 However, the RPD did not make express findings with respect to these latter issues. I accept that the Appellants signed documents unaware of the contents of those documents and I do not make a negative credibility inference concerning the dates when they were in hiding. Although I found the RPD to be incorrect with respect to this particular finding, I find that the RPD was correct in its overall findings that A.K. does not have the motivation to pursue the Appellants should they return to India.\nA.K.'s interest in the Appellant due to the land dispute\n[40] I find the RPD is correct in finding that the Appellants have not established that A.K. has an interest in pursuing the Appellants owing to the land dispute, and more particularly, the dispute concerning A.K.'s control of drains that allow waters to flood the agricultural lands that the Principal Appellant co-owns with his father and brother.\n[41] The Appellants' BOC notes that the threats from A.K. were because of the Principal Appellant's family's complaints from the flooding from A.K.'s land.23 However, the Appellants have been in Canada since XXXX 2019, and have not made any complaints or even communicated with A.K. since they left India.\n[42] I find that the RPD is correct in finding the Principal Appellant's testimony to be evasive as to why A.K. would continue to search for him in New Delhi. The Principal Appellant testified that he was still a target by A.K. and he explained that the dispute continues because he co-owns the land with his brother and father.24 When the RPD asked why would A.K. have any interest in him considering that he has been away for three years and made no complaints concerning the land, the Principal Appellant testified that there remains a strong amount of rivalry.25 The Principal Appellant's response is not reasonable that he remains the target because his father remains a strong supporter of INLD, and as noted, the Principal Appellant has not complained about the land or has been involved in local politics for over three years. Moreover, it is not reasonable that A.K. focusses on the Principal Appellant as the target when the other co-owners, the father and brother, remain in the same village.\n[43] The Appellants acknowledge that the land dispute is not at the core of A.K.'s interest in pursuing the Appellants, but an on-going grudge or rivalry. In their Legal Memorandum, the Appellants state:\n...that he is likely no longer being targeted by XXXX XXXX specifically because of their prior land dispute. When asked why he would still be targeted because of the land dispute when his father and brothers were co-owners of the land and still present in the village, the Appellant clarified that he was still being targeted because of the grudge that grew from both the land dispute and his political inclinations, which went above and beyond his family's.26\n[44] I have already found that the Appellants have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. wants to pursue a rivalry or grudge such that he willing to pursue them across the India although they have not participated in any political activity in the state or made complaints about the land dispute in over three years.\n[45] The RPD correctly noted that neither of the affidavits from the Principal Appellant's father mention that A.K. is inquiring about the Principal Appellant pertaining to the land dispute.27\n[46] Further, while the Principal Appellant states that A.K. continues to pursue him because he is the co-owner of the land, the Principal Appellant could relinquish his property rights in order to avoid the dispute. Courts have established that property rights claims, although well-founded, are not a basis for a refugee claim. The Courts have said that claimants may have to make reasonable choices to free themselves of a risk of harm, and they must be expected to pursue those options.28 The Courts have said that this principle is applicable to both risks under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.29\n[47] I find that the Appellants have not established with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. has a continuing interest in the Principal Appellant concerning the land dispute. The Principal Appellants could also make reasonable choices to free themselves of a risk of harm by relinquishing his interest in the land that he co-owns to further reduce or avoid any conflict with A.K.\n[48] In summary, I find that the Appellants have not established with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. retains a continuing interest to pursue the Appellants either because of the Principal Appellant's affiliation with INLD or because of his interest in a land dispute. Although the Principal Appellant offered the allegation that it was a rivalry or a grudge that motivates A.K., there is no insufficient evidence to establish the basis for this allegation.30 I find that the RPD is correct in finding that there is no evidence concerning any efforts by A.K. to inquire about the Appellants outside of their village. Even if A.K. asks his father occasionally, there is no evidence about either A.K. or members of the BJP searching for the Appellants outside their village or the state of Haryana.\nWhether the agents of persecution have the means to pursue the Appellants in New Delhi (including the Appellants' Issue No. 2 - whether the RPD erred by failing to properly assess the risk the Appellant would face on relocating to New Delhi\nRPD's findings\n[49] The RPD found that the agents of persecution do not have the means to locate the Appellants through their use of the Aadhaar Card or the tenant verification system.\n[50] The RPD found that the Appellants would not be in hiding as the agents of persecution have not threatened violence against them or their families.\nAppellants' submissions\n[51] The Appellants state that the RPD erred in finding that the BJP does not have the means or connection to pursue the Appellants in the proposed IFA because although the BJP is not the ruling party in Delhi, it is a national ruling party in India and has a large membership and influence across the country. The Appellants submit that the RPD failed to consider the BJP's true scope and influence.\n[52] The Appellants state that the RPD erred in finding that the agents of persecution would not trace him through family members, acquaintances or social community. The Appellants state that A.K. swore a false FIR against his family, where he claimed the Principal Appellant's father, uncle and cousin assaulted him, with his father being arrested, and thus has shown a willingness to harm the Principal Appellant's family and it does not matter that no harm has come to his family since they have been in Canada.\nFindings\n[53] The Appellants did not provide specific submissions with respect to whether the agents of persecution have the means to locate them, except to state that the RPD erred by not considering the influence of the BJP across the country. The Appellants have not provided any specific evidence of the influence, means or capacity of the BJP to locate persons throughout India. I have already found that the Appellants have not established that the BJP has the motivation or the interest to pursue the Appellants in New Delhi.\n[54] I find that the Appellants cannot be tracked through the tenant registration system. According to the objective evidence, the tenant registration system is intended to detect whether a person has any criminal record.31 The document indicates that the system is mandatory and the tenant verification programme exists in New Delhi.32 However, according to the same source, the police force is too ill-equipped and short-staffed to actually carry out verifications.33 One source noted that one of the state uses of Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS) is the verification of tenants, but that CCTNS use for this purpose varies widely between states and the police do not make any effort to follow up with the concerned police station of other states.34\n[55] Even if the Appellants' names are checked through the CCTNS, there is no evidence that their names would be found in any of the police databases. Although an FIR was registered against him, the Principal Appellant testified that it was withdrawn and not valid.35 The Appellants provided no evidence that they are persons of interest to the police. Further, the Appellants have not provided credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. has such influence as to be able to work with the police to access the CCTNS.\n[56] I also find that the Appellant cannot be located through the use of the Aadhaar Card. A Response to Information Request researched by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada found in the NDP indicates that, according to the governing legislation, there is no legal access to Aadhaar data in any police database, including the CCTNS.36 I find, based on the information in the NDP, that the Appellants have not established that he can be tracked by obtaining an Aadhaar number.\n[57] I disagree with the Appellant's submission that he would have to remain in hiding in the proposed IFA.\n[58] I agree with the Appellants that the courts have stated that the general principle is that a refugee cannot be expected to live in hiding in order for a proposed IFA to be reasonable and that family members should not be required to place their own lives in danger by refraining to disclose the location of the claimants in the IFA. I find that the circumstances of the present appeal are different than the caselaw cited by the Appellant. In the Ali 37 case, the agents of harm were members of a terrorist group who threatened violence and death against the claimants and their families. I have found that the Appellants have not established with credible and trustworthy evidence that A.K. or the BJP have the motivation or means to pursue him. Further, similar to the circumstances in this appeal, the Courts have held that claimants are not in hiding where they have not provided any evidence to suggest that their family would undermine their safety in the IFAs as it is their onus to establish that there is a likelihood of their whereabouts being disclosed to the agents of harm.38 There is no evidence the Appellants' family is required to hide the Appellants' location in order to protect their own safety as there are no threats of violence directed toward the Principal Appellant's father or brother by the agents of persecution. Although there may be occasional inquiries by A.K., the Appellants' relatives have remained in the same village since the time the Appellants travelled to Canada and there is no evidence that they are in danger of withholding information.\n[59] In the circumstances of this appeal, the Appellants are not being asked to hide their location from the family or friends to keep them safe. I agree with the RPD that there is no evidence that the Principal Appellant's father has been harmed or threatened in the hope of having the Appellants' location disclosed. I have already found that the Principal Appellant can relinquish his interest in the land he co-owns with his family to avoid any future issues with A.K, if that remains an issue, and I have found that the Appellants are not a threat or issue of concern for A.K. in New Delhi as INLD is not a party in that state. The Appellants have been out of the country since XXXX 2019 and, according to the Principal Appellant's testimony, A.K. does not know they are in Canada, which demonstrates that no family member has disclosed their location.39\n[60] The Appellants submit that A.K. filed an FIR against the father in 2014 and has subsequently threatened A.K. and his family. However, I note that A.K. withdrew the accusations that formed the basis of the FIR and, as noted, the Principal Appellant's family have remained living in same area as A.K. since that time.\n[61] In my independent review of the evidence, I find that the Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the motivation to locate them in New Delhi owing to either the Principal Appellant's affiliation with the INLD or his interest in the land dispute. I also find that the Appellants have not established that the agents of persecution have the means to locate them through the CCTNS database, the Aadhaar Card or the tenant registration system.\nDid the RPD err in finding that it was not unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to one of the proposed IFAs under the Second Prong of the Test?\n[62] The RPD found that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to New Delhi. It found that the Appellants speak Hindi. The Principal Appellant has work experience as a XXXX in India and the Associate Appellant has work experience in Canada.\n[63] The Appellant did not provide specific submissions with respect to the second prong of the IFA test.\nFindings on Second Prong of the IFA Test\n[64] Under the second prong, there is a very high threshold requiring actual and concrete evidence of conditions which would jeopardize the life or safety of the Appellants in temporarily relocating to the proposed IFAs.40 I find that the RPD did not err in finding that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to New Delhi.\n[65] I agree with the RPD's finding that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate to one of the IFAs. The Appellants have not provided specific submission with respect to this finding.\n[66] The Appellants are Hindu and speak Hindi. According to the objective evidence, over 79 per cent of the population of India are Hindu and some 43 percent of the population speak Hindi.41 There is no evidence that Appellants could not practice their religion or would have issues with language in New Delhi.\n[67] The Principal Appellant worked in agriculture in India and trained as a XXXX. He then XXXX his XXXX XXXX. The Associate Appellant has worked in Canada.\n[68] I have also reviewed the evidentiary record to review the Appellants' personal circumstances and I found no mental health, medical or other circumstance that would make their relocation to India objectively unreasonable.\n[69] After an independent assessment of the evidence, I conclude that the Appellants have a viable IFA in New Delhi. I find that they do not face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, or a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in one of the proposed IFAs. I find that it would not be objectively unreasonable in all of the circumstances for the Appellants to relocate to New Delhi.\nCONCLUSION\n[70] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPaul Muldoon\nPaul Muldoon\nJanuary 16, 2023\nDate\n1 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\", under the 1951 Convention.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, sections 96 and 97.\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He alleges that, some time in 2004 or 2005, he lost touch with his parents. He alleges that, when he contacted his aunts and uncles, they would not answer or respond to him. He alleges that, in 2006, he received news from a childhood friend in the police that his parents were Falun Gong (FG) practitioners and that they had been killed. He alleges that the friend told him not to return to China. The Appellant remained in Canada. He had a XXXX in 2020. He alleges that, after this, he learned about the refugee protection process and therefore made his claim.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) identified credibility and forward-looking risk as the determinative issues. However, the RPD made no negative credibility findings. The RPD did find that the Appellant's substantial delay in claiming undermined his subjective fear. The RPD also found that the Appellant had not established a forward-looking risk. The RPD found any risk in the future to be speculative.\n[4] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by stating that credibility was an issue and not making any findings. The Appellant also argues that delay in claiming is insufficient to defeat his claim. Finally, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in concluding that he had no forward-facing risk. He argues that, given he is credible, this establishes his risk. He also argues that the country conditions support his allegations of risk. The Appellant has not submitted new evidence, nor has he requested a hearing.\n[5] I find that the determinative issue is forward-facing risk. I agree with the Appellant that the RPD did not make any negative credibility findings. I accept his evidence for the purpose of assessment. I find that subjective fear is not determinative, and I will not address it. I find that the evidence does not establish more than a mere possibility of persecution or a section 97 risk, on a balance of probabilities, on a forward-facing basis.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[7] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1 I find the RPD's decision is correct.\n[8] The RPD correctly found that the Appellant had not established a forward-facing risk. The Appellant argues that this is incorrect for two main reasons. First, he argues that, given he is credible, the RPD must accept his testimony which is that his life is at risk in China. Second, he argues that documentary evidence supports his argument that he is at risk.\n[9] I reject these arguments. First, I find that just because the Appellant is credible (i.e., telling the truth) does not mean he has established a risk. Second, I find that the country documents do not establish that all family members of FG practitioners are at risk, and the evidence does not support a finding of risk in the Appellant's case.\n[10] The RPD also identified credibility as a determinative issue. However, as noted by the Appellant, no credibility findings were made. Therefore, I am accepting the Appellant's allegations as credible for the purposes of assessment. I will not address the Appellant's arguments on credibility except as they pertain to his forward-facing risk. Additionally, I find that the issue of subjective fear is not determinative, and I will not address the Appellant's arguments on this point. I am not relying on delay in claiming in reaching my conclusion.\nCredibility does not automatically equate to establishing risk\n[11] I find that concluding the Appellant is credible is not tantamount to finding that he is at risk, as the Appellant submits.\n[12] The Appellant argues that the RPD cannot make a finding of a lack of credibility based on a lack of documentary evidence. He argues that there is no evidence to contradict his statements, and the Board cannot draw unsupported inferences. He argues that there is a presumption of truth; therefore, the RPD erred in not accepting his testimony.\n[13] I find the Appellant's arguments misconstrue the law on credibility. As stated above, I accept the Appellant's allegations as credible for the purposes of analysis. This does not necessarily equate to a finding that he is at risk.\n[14] The Appellant's evidence is as follows:\n(a) He lost contact with his parents after coming to Canada in 2003.\n(b) His relatives would not talk to him or explain what happened.\n(c) In 2006, he learned from a childhood friend, who was a member of the police force, that his parents were killed for being FG practitioners. He alleges that the friend told him \"Don't you all want to die? They're all dead! Don't come to me again. You don't come back home. You can do it yourself!\"2\n(d) The Appellant has not spoken to the friend since 2006. He has had no further news from China since this time.\n[15] Accepting this as credible does not necessarily mean that the Appellant has established a section 96 or 97 risk on the necessary threshold.\n[16] As the Federal Court has explained, credibility is about truthfulness and reliability.3 Finding that the Appellant is credible simply means that the above statements are true and accurate (on a balance of probabilities). This does not necessarily mean they are probative of risk. Probative value is the ability of evidence to establish a conclusion.4 In my view, the facts above do not establish the conclusion of risk, on the correct threshold.\n[17] The evidence does not establish that the Chinese government was looking for the Appellant or was even aware of him at the time the Appellant's parents disappeared. The fact that the friend said \"[d]on't you all want to die\" is too vague to establish any specific risk to the Appellant at this time. Moreover, the evidence does not show that the government has had any interest in him in the over 15 years since he learned of his parents' death.\n[18] In my view, accepting the evidence as credible is insufficient to establish more than a mere possibility of persecution or a section 97 risk, on a balance of probabilities. The evidence does not even establish that the Appellant himself (who is not an FG practitioner) was at risk in 2006.\nCountry conditions documents do not establish risk, in this case\n[19] The RPD correctly assessed the country conditions. The RPD considered that there was evidence that family members of FG practitioners were sometimes subjected to harassment, detention, ill-treatment or torture. The RPD also considered that this particularly happens when charges are brought against the FG practitioners or when family is used to try and get practitioners to stop. Finally, the RPD considered that the evidence shows there was no obvious logic as to why some people are targeted and others are not.\n[20] The RPD correctly concluded that, given there was no evidence that the Chinese state was pursuing the Appellant, and his parents had already died, this evidence was not sufficient to establish a risk in his case.\n[21] The Appellant argues that persecution of family members of FG practitioners is well documented. The Appellant points to the same evidence cited by the RPD. I agree with both the RPD and the Appellant that this evidence shows there is some chance that, as the family member of FG practitioners, the Appellant could face a range of treatment from harassment to discrimination up to persecution.\nConsidering the evidence in its totality, the Appellant has not established a forward-facing risk\n[22] I find that the Appellant has not established that he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution on a forward-facing basis considering the country conditions and the personal evidence in its totality. The Appellant submits that, given he is credible, he is the child of FG practitioners who were subject to persecution, therefore he will face persecution. I do not find that this is established.\n[23] I find the country conditions suggest that it is not discernible which family members of FG practitioners are subject to mistreatment, but there is an increased likelihood if the FG practitioner is currently being pursued in court or being sought. The evidence shows that the Appellant's parents have been deceased for at least 17 years and therefore cannot be currently pursued. There is no evidence that the Appellant was ever sought in relation to his parents, or that Chinese authorities were ever aware of him. When I consider this together, I find that it does not meet the threshold of more than a mere possibility or persecution. I find that there is a possibility of persecution, but nothing more.\n[24] For the same reasons, I find that the Appellant has not established that he faces a section 97 risk, on a balance of probabilities, as this is a higher threshold.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nErin Bobkin\nE.

They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated October 13, 2022. The Appellants allege that they faced a risk to their lives at the hands of the Sinaloa cartel. The RPD found that the Appellants had a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in M\u00e9rida and rejected their claims.\n[2] For the reasons that follow, the appeal is allowed, and the matter is returned to a differently constituted panel of the RPD.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellants allege that the Principal Appellant moved people across the Mexico\/US border as a source of income. The Appellants allege that the Principal Appellant was intercepted by the Sinaloa cartel, who kidnapped and assaulted him. They allege that the cartel demanded to know who the Principal Appellant worked for, and when he was unable to provide that information, they decided to kill him. The Appellants allege that the Principal Appellant's mother was able to convince the man who was set to kill the Principal Appellant to spare his life since she knew him as a customer at her XXXX XXXX. The Appellants allege that they fear that the Sinaloa cartel would continue to target them.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[4] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.1\nANALYSIS\nAppellants' arguments\n[5] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in finding that they a had a viable IFA. They argue that the Sinaloa cartel has both the means and motivation to locate and harm them throughout Mexico. The Appellants also seek to admit new evidence, which they argue satisfies the requirements to be entered with their appeal.\nI cannot determine whether certain allegations are credible or whether the Appellants have a viable IFA without rehearing the evidence before the RPD.\n[6] The RPD states that it accepted that the Appellants' allegations were credible but does not state why it came to this conclusion. Furthermore, there are aspects of the Appellants' allegations that are not considered in its IFA analysis.\n[7] The RPD found that the determinative issue was whether the Appellants had a viable IFA in M\u00e9rida. In its first prong analysis, the RPD concluded that the Sinaloa cartel did not have the ongoing motivation to locate and harm the Appellants. However, the RPD erred in its analysis by failing to fully consider various allegations, including whether they were credible, which were directly relevant to the analysis of whether the cartel has an on-going motivation to locate the Appellants.\n[8] There are a number of issues that were not fully canvassed or assessed by the RPD. For example, the identity of the individual who recruited the Appellant to move people across the border, and whether they are associated to a cartel. Further the Appellants' narrative indicates that his sister-in-law died, and they were fearful \"With fear of meeting those people, but fortunately being there we realized that they had been killed or disappeared already for a time.\"2 There is no discussion of what this means, and whether the Appellants are suggesting that the people who targeted them had died, which of course would be relevant to whether they could safely relocate to the IFA.\n[9] Furthermore, there were unexplored inconsistencies about what happened to the Appellants after they moved, which is central to whether the cartel has the means and motivation to locate them in the IFA.\n[10] The Appellants alleged in their narrative that they received messages from unknown callers in 20193 after moving to Guanajuato. However, at the hearing, the Principal Appellant testified that he knew that the messages he received were from the cartel because \"they said so\"4 which is inconsistent with their narratives. Also, at their hearing the Principal Appellant testified that after moving to Guanajuato, he was attacked by two armed thugs that he believed were associated with the cartel.5 This alleged attack is not mentioned in the Appellants' narratives, which raises questions about the credibility of this allegation.\n[11] I will also note that there are various inconsistencies in the Appellants' evidence, including variations between their testimony, narratives and support letters that were not fully canvassed. This includes how the Principal Appellant was able to call his sister when he was being held by the cartel, whether or not the military assisted his sister, and how his mother came to know of his kidnapping and secured his release.\n[12] I find that it was an error to fully consider these allegations in the first prong of the IFA analysis. However, as I set out, I cannot come to a determination on these issues without rehearing the evidence, assessing the credibility of these allegations and their relevance to whether the Appellants could safely relocate.\n[13] In considering the second prong analysis by the RPD, I find that RPD erred by failing to address a piece of the Appellants' supporting evidence, namely the \"report\" the Appellants submitted that seemingly suggests they have Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. This report is on plain paper, with no letterhead or indication of the author's credentials. The \"report\" is simple signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.6 On redetermination, the RPD should question the Appellants on this report and properly determine what impact, if any, this may have on the Appellants' ability to reasonably relocate.\n[14] Finally, I note that there seems to not have been any consideration of whether the Principal Appellant's actions of helping migrants enter the United States was legal or involved human smuggling. This is of course a significant issue, as it could potentially lead to issues of exclusion being raised. This needs to be canvassed on the redetermination of the Appellants' claims.\n[15] I will not make a determination on the admissibility of the Appellants new evidence, as they can submit it to the RPD for consideration on the redetermination of their claims.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined by a differently constituted panel.\nDIRECTIONS TO THE RPD\n[17] The previous record will be included in the redetermination of the Appellants' claims.\n[18] The RPD must canvass the issues highlighted in these reasons.\n(signed)\nJ.

Motifs et d\u00e9cision\nPerson who is the subject of the appeal\nXXXX XXXX XXXX\nPersonne en cause\nDate of decision\nJune 1, 2023\nDate de la d\u00e9cision\nPanel\nE.

He alleges that he has had two same-sex relationships in Nigeria. He also says that he was pressured to marry a woman and did so. The Appellant alleges that his most recent same-sex partner was arrested and disclosed their relationship. Based on this, he fled Nigeria and made a refugee claim.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Appellant lacked credibility. Specifically, the RPD found that the Appellant's testimony about his two same-sex partners was vague. The RPD found that the corroborating documents did not overcome this.\n[4] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred. He argues that it is an error to ask SOGIESC individuals to hide their identity. He also argues that corroborating evidence may not be available. Ultimately, he argues that the RPD did not apply the SOGIESC Guideline.1 He also argues that it was incorrect to discount corroborating documents because they were notarized. Finally, he argues that his membership in the LGBTQ community in Toronto should be given more weight. The Appellant has not submitted new evidence, nor has he requested an oral hearing.\n[5] I find the RPD's decision is incorrect. On an independent assessment of the evidence, I find errors that arise perceptibly, though the Appellant's Counsel did not raise them. First, while I agree that the Appellant was vague about his testimony about his partners, I find that the RPD did not consider the totality of the evidence. I find that there was credible evidence of the Appellant's sexual orientation, and the RPD did not weigh this against the vague testimony. I find that there were no material inconsistencies and omissions, and the Appellant has met the standard of proof required in a refugee claim. I therefore find that he is a Convention refugee as it is trite that members of sexual minorities face a risk of persecution.\n[6] I did not give notice to the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (Minister) that I was considering the remainder of the Convention definition, as, in my view, this does not meet the test in Alazar. Given the certainty in the evidence regarding the risks to SOGIESC persons in Nigeria, my findings flow from overturning the credibility determination.\nDECISION\n[7] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\n[8] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 I find that the RPD's decision is not correct.\nThe RPD did not weigh the totality of the evidence: the Appellant is credible, on a balance of probabilities\n[9] Reviewing the evidence on the record, I find that the Appellant has established his allegations, on a balance of probabilities. This includes that he is a bisexual man and that he is wanted in Nigeria because of the discovery of his same-sex relationship.\nOn an independent assessment of the evidence, the Appellant's vague evidence does not undermine his credibility\n[10] The RPD found that the Appellant was vague in his testimony about his two same-sex partners. I find that the RPD's decision in this regard was nuanced and sensitive to the SOGIESC Guideline.\n[11] Nevertheless, the Refugee Appeal Division's (RAD's) standard of review is one of correctness. I take a different view of the Appellant's explanation that he still felt afraid and had difficulty giving his testimony. I accept that, given his history growing up in a country where same-sex relationships are considered an abomination, it would be difficult to testify openly in detail about these relationships.\n[12] Therefore, I find that the vagueness in the testimony about his partners does not undermine the Appellant's credibility.\n[13] Moreover, as I will discuss below, even if I were to confirm the RPD's findings on vagueness, I do not find that these are sufficient concerns to conclude that the Appellant is not credible, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe RPD did not weigh the vague testimony against the remainder of the testimony\n[14] The RPD's decision focuses only on the vague testimony and does not weigh it against the credible testimony. Reviewing the record in its totality, there was substantial credible evidence.\n[15] First, there were no material inconsistencies between the testimony and the Basis of Claim form (BOC). There were also no material omissions from the BOC or the testimony. The RPD did not mention this in its decision.\n[16] Second, and more significant, reviewing the testimony, I found it contained details which had a ring of truth. For example, the Appellant was able to explain how he managed to make a long-term same-sex relationship work in secret, while remaining married. He explained that he kept his boyfriend separate in a different state where he could plausibly be working. He also testified that, when his wife and children came to visit him, his boyfriend would go out of the house and sleep elsewhere.\n[17] Additionally, the Appellant testified about the pressure to marry and why he got married and why his boyfriend did not. He explained that, as the oldest male child, there was significant pressure for him to marry. He testified that his boyfriend was not the firstborn son, and therefore he did not have the same pressure to marry and did not do so.\n[18] I find these details to be compelling. The RPD made no mention of this, or of any other testimony. Based on the RPD's reasons, it seems that the only reason for the negative credibility decision was the vague testimony about the relationships. The RPD makes the negative findings and then goes on to state that documentary evidence does not overcome these findings.\n[19] The standard of proof in a refugee claim is a balance of probabilities. The RPD did not explain how the two negative credibility findings on vagueness are sufficient to outweigh the other credible testimony. In my view, they are not. Even if I accept that the Appellant was unreasonably vague in discussing his boyfriends, I find this vagueness is outweighed by the fact that his testimony is otherwise credible and consistent, and he gave details with the ring of truth.\n[20] Furthermore, as I will discuss below, I also find that there was documentary evidence which supports the Appellant's credibility.\nThe documentary evidence supports the claim\n[21] The RPD found that the documentary evidence did not outweigh the credibility concerns. Again, I disagree. As explained above, I find that the credibility concerns were either minor in comparison with the credible testimony, or were incorrect findings. Therefore, I do not find that they are sufficient to outweigh the documentary evidence.\n[22] I accept that the Appellant's participation in the LGBTQ community in Toronto supports his alleged sexual orientation.\n[23] Regarding the affidavits from friends and family, I agree with the RPD that they are of limited weight given that they rely largely on reporting from the Appellant. I also agree that they are unusual in that they are sworn affidavits dealing with same-sex relationships which would be rare in Nigeria. I find these to be of limited weight, but they support the allegations.\nConclusion on credibility: the allegations are established, on a balance of probabilities\n[24] Based on the Appellant's testimony, and his evidence of participation in the LGBTQ community in Canada, I accept his allegations as credible, on a balance of probabilities. I find that he has established that he is bisexual and that his same-sex partner was arrested and killed. I find that he has established that his sexual orientation has been exposed as a result.\nThe Appellant meets the test for Convention refugee status\n[25] I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution based upon his sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is a particular social group which has a nexus to the Convention.\n[26] The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) indicates that, \"harassment, threats, discrimination, and incidents of violence\" against LGBTQI+ persons continue to be reported.3 State actors are reported to be involved in more than 10 percent of these incidents.4 A mere allegation or accusation of same-sex activity is often sufficient for arrest and detention.5 Sexual minorities face persecution in Nigeria from the state as well as members of the community, ranging from extortion and mob violence to death.6 Based upon this, I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution based upon his sexual orientation.\n[27] Regarding state protection, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to seek the protection of the Nigerian state. Nigerian authorities are known to target sexual minorities, as described above. The Appellant's evidence is that his same-sex partner was arrested, and their relationship is known to authorities. Therefore, the state is one of the agents of persecution in this claim.\n[28] I also find that there is no internal flight alternative (IFA) for the Appellant. Given that the country evidence of the treatment of sexual minorities is country-wide, and given that persecution comes from the state, I find that the Appellant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria.\n[29] For these reasons, the Appellant meets the definition of a Convention refugee. I did not give notice to the Minister that I would consider the remainder of the Convention definition. I considered whether \"the case has materially shifted away from the RPD's decision and the appeal as it was framed by the [person subject to the appeal]\"7 such that procedural fairness requires me to notify the Minister before rendering my decision. Given that the state is one of the agents of persecution in Nigeria, and the country documents on the treatment of sexual minorities are quite clear, I find that the case has not materially shifted. It naturally flows from a decision to overturn the credibility findings that the remainder of the test is met.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nErin Bobkin\nE.

She alleges a risk to her life from the Chinese Public Security Bureau (PSB) and X.T.,1 the daughter of the Deputy XXXX of XXXX City. The Appellant alleges that she taught X.T.'s son in the XXXX PSB Kindergarten. In 2019, the Appellant disciplined X.T.'s son for bullying other students; he was made to stand next to a wall. After this incident, the Appellant alleges that X.T. came to the school, assaulted her, and told her that she will die for abusing her son.2 The Appellant alleges that she was accosted and threatened by men who work for the Deputy XXXX. She also alleges that the police came to her home. In XXXX 2019,3 she left China for Canada and signed her Basis of Claim (BOC) form in March 2020. She alleges that the PSB continue to monitor and interrogate her husband in China.\n[3] This is the Appellant's second time before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). In October 2021, the first Refugee Protection Division (RPD) panel rejected the Appellant's claim. In July 2022, the first RAD panel found that the first RPD panel erred in assessing credibility and failed to question on material evidence in the claim.4 The first RAD panel allowed the Appellant's appeal and sent her claim back to the RPD to be redetermined. On redetermination, the second RPD panel recognized the Appellant as a vulnerable person based on her severe and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX), XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.5 The RPD applied the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) Chairperson's Guideline 8: Procedures with Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Vulnerable Persons Guideline).6 The second RPD panel rejected the Appellant's claim, finding that she failed to establish a nexus, she is not credible, and she has not established a claim under subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).7 The Appellant argues that this second RPD decision is incorrect. She argues that the RPD erred when it repeated the first RPD panel's plausibility findings, microscopically assessed the evidence, and failed to consider her psychological condition when assessing credibility. She has not filed any new evidence on appeal, and I cannot hold a hearing.8\n[4] I am reviewing the RPD decision on the standard of correctness as I do not find the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage.9 The RPD does not have a meaningful advantage simply because it held an oral hearing.10 I have the complete RPD Record, including the RPD hearing audio-recording and transcript. My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. In my independent assessment, I find the RPD's credibility and section 97(1) determinations are incorrect. I also find that the Appellant does not have access to state protection or an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in China and she is a person in need of protection.\nDECISION\n[5] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUE AT THE RAD\n[6] The Minister did not intervene in the Appellant's claim before the RPD or the RAD. Further to the Federal Court's decision in Alazar, I have considered whether \"the case has materially shifted away from the RPD decision and the appeal as it was framed by the [person subject to the appeal]\" such that procedural fairness requires me to notify the Minister before rendering my decision.11 I find that no such issue has arisen.\n[7] In my view, there is no new issue that is legally and factually distinct from the grounds of appeal which cannot reasonably be said to stem from the RPD decision or the issues on appeal as framed by the Appellant.12 The RPD found the Appellant not credible.13 In the Appeal Record, the Appellant argues that this finding is incorrect. She also argues that she fears the Chinese state. The absence of state protection and an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) reasonably stems from the Appellant's fear of state agents in China, given that the Chinese state exercises its power throughout the whole of its territory. The RPD also found that the Appellant failed to establish a nexus or a claim under subsection 97. In my view, each determinative issue in this appeal has been raised in, or reasonably stems from, the RPD decision and the Appeal Record. The Appeal Record was provided to the Minister.14 This has given the Minister sufficient notice of the live issues in this appeal. As such, there is no procedural fairness breach to the Minister in my finding that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nThe Appellant has credibly established her allegations, on a balance of probabilities\n[8] The RPD found the Appellant not credible because: (1) She omitted from her BOC the date that the police visited her home, and dates that the police visited her husband at home after she had already left China; (2) When describing the police visit in her BOC, she did not mention that the home was also searched; (3) When describing in her BOC that she was accosted and threatened on the street, she did not mention that she was also threatened with detention; (4) When describing in her BOC that her husband was questioned by police after she had already left China, she did not specify the treatment he received; and (5) While she corrected her personal history on her immigration forms, her first version contained an error. The RPD also made plausibility findings based on the actions of Chinese PSB and school authorities, drew an adverse inference based on the decision of the Appellant's adult daughter not to claim protection, made a negative finding based on the Appellant's delay in claiming, and accorded the supporting evidence little weight because the Appellant is not credible. Counsel argues that the RPD's credibility assessment is incorrect. I agree. In my independent assessment, I find that the RPD's credibility determination is in error. I find the Appellant has credibly established her allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe RPD erred in assigning little weight to the Appellant's XXXX evidence\n[9] The RPD designated the Appellant a vulnerable person based on the XXXX evidence on Record,15 pursuant to the Vulnerable Persons Guideline. The RPD offered the following procedural accommodations: a more informal setting for the proceeding, varying the order of questioning, providing a woman RPD Member and interpreter, and frequent breaks.16 However, Counsel before the RPD, who is different from Counsel on appeal, declined to question the Appellant first. In designating her a Vulnerable Person, the RPD accepted that the Appellant is a person \"whose ability to present their cases before the IRB is severely impaired.\"17 The RPD accepted the XXXX diagnosis.18 Despite this, the RPD did not consider the Appellant's symptoms or diagnosis when making credibility findings. The RPD assigned the XXXX report \"little evidentiary weight\" because the Appellant lacks credibility, the report is based on the Appellant's evidence, and the RPD is \"unable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the XXXX findings and the facts found in the claimant's request for refugee protection.\"19 Counsel argues that the RPD's credibility findings were \"made without regard to the Appellant's status as a Vulnerable Person in a seriously compromised mental state.\"20 I agree.\n[10] The Appellant's XXXX report indicates that she has XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.21 The XXXX outlines their qualifications, method of assessment, and how they reached their professional opinion. It is not the case that the report is based only on the Appellant's self-reporting. The XXXX clearly sets out the objective tests they performed in the assessment.22 Moreover, in Kanthasamy, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that XXXX reports will necessarily rely on some degree of hearsay and that a rejection of a report on this basis \"is unrealistic and results in the absence of significant evidence.\"23\n[11] In my view, the Appellant's XXXX report satisfies the requirements for an expert report identified in the Vulnerable Persons Guideline.24 Indeed, this report formed the basis of the RPD decision to accept that the Appellant's ability to present her case is severely impaired, and to designate her a Vulnerable Person.\n[12] I find that the XXXX report evidence sets out the Appellant's trauma response, including her XXXX XXXX XXXX and avoidance of XXXX XXXX, in detail, and I assign it full weight. The XXXX notes that the Appellant experiences:\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[...] Significant diminished ability to XXXX or XXXX as well as XXXX\n[...] Becoming XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,\")\nBecoming XXXX XXXX by reminders of XXXX XXXX (i,e,: reminders such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,)\nAvoidance of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,\")\nAvoidance of activities that might XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"I do XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,\")\n[...] [XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX [emphases added].25\n[13] In my view, this is significant. However, the RPD did not discuss this part of the report in its credibility assessment. The RPD erred when it failed to assess one of the principal reasons that this report was submitted into evidence-to explain the Appellant's difficulty with concentration and avoidance due to the trauma that she has experienced.\n[14] In my independent assessment, I have taken a trauma-informed approach. On July 18, 2022, the Chairperson announced that the IRB has an \"existing commitment to trauma-informed adjudication in all refugee and immigration cases involving individuals who have experienced trauma [emphasis added].\"26 Specifically, the IRB Chairperson states that \"recognizing the challenges people who have experienced trauma may face is part of the Board's overall adjudicative strategy for fair, timely and well-reasoned decision-making.\"27\n[15] Trauma-informed adjudication involves anticipating the possibility that trauma may impact a person's memory and their ability to provide testimony.28 While an allegation of trauma does not prevent an adverse finding based on material credibility concerns,29 decision-makers should \"consider the person's response and whether trauma or its aftereffects may reasonably explain the perceived discrepancy.\"30 For this reason, \"Members should consider whether an expert report that has been admitted into evidence explains any inconsistencies, omissions, or other credibility issues in respect of the person's testimony.\"31 This should take place \"when assessing the individual's credibility and not separately after the credibility assessment.\"32\n[16] Trauma can \"completely overwhelm an individual's ability to cope with, or integrate the ideas and emotions involved in that experience\" and a traumatic event \"can elicit intense feelings of fear, terror, helplessness, hopelessness, and despair often subjectively experienced as a threat to the person's survival.\"33 This is because \"[m]emories of traumatic events are processed differently neurologically from memories of non-threatening events\" which can impair coding, storage, and coherence of memories.34\n[17] In my view, the Appellant's trauma, as detailed in her XXXX report, reasonably explains her difficulty providing evidence about traumatic details. While the RPD is correct that the Appellant's BOC omits the specific dates of incidents, and she fails to include some of the traumatic details of events,35 I find that the Appellant's difficulty concentrating, and her avoidance of traumatic memories reasonably explains these omissions. It is not the case that she left out entire incidents; rather, her omissions concern traumatic details which are reasonably explained by her XXXX report. I draw no adverse inference on this basis.\n[18] Moreover, the Appellant provided letters from her husband, her husband's lawyer, and her neighbour which corroborate many of the details which the Appellant did not include in her BOC.36 In particular, the Appellant's husband's letter discusses his questioning by Chinese authorities on three occasions, including the failure of officials to provide him with food and water during his detention.37 The supporting documents were provided ahead of the RPD hearing. It is an error for the RPD to find a material omission where evidence is tendered by other means in advance of the hearing.38\n[19] Counsel also argues that the RPD microscopically assessed the evidence when it made a negative finding based on an error in the Appellant's personal history in her immigration forms. Counsel argues that the Appellant corrected her error, and no adverse inference was warranted.39 I agree. While the RPD acknowledges that the Appellant corrected her personal history on her immigration forms,40 it drew an adverse inference because the first version of the forms contained an error. In my independent assessment, I note that the Appellant mistakenly wrote in her first version of the form that she was in Canada from XXXX 2018 to present.41 However, in this same form, she also correctly included her time in China from XXXX 2018 to XXXX 2019 and specified her detailed address history.42 In another form completed on the same date, she also correctly included her travel history, noting that she left China for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019.43 I draw no adverse inference based on the Appellant's initial immigration form error.\nThe RPD's plausibility findings are in error\n[20] The RPD determined that the Appellant's ability to remain employed in China, her ability to secure an employment letter, her ability to retain her Chinese passport, and the absence of a summons is implausible.44 Counsel argues that these plausibility findings were not made in the clearest of cases and are incorrect.45 I agree. Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the RPD's plausibility findings are in error.\n[21] While the RPD is entitled to make findings based on rationality, common sense, or plausibility, such findings must be reasonably set out and supported by the evidence. The RPD findings are based on the plausibility of the actions of her employer and her agents of harm. It is an error to speculate about the actions of a reasonable persecutor or agent of harm.46 Moreover, implausibility findings are inherently subjective assessments that are largely dependent on an individual decision-maker's perceptions of what constitutes rational behaviour.47 It is because of this arbitrariness that implausibility findings should only be made in the \"clearest of cases\", where: (1) The facts are outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected; or (2) The documentary evidence demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner alleged.48 In my view, it is not outside the realm of possibility that the Appellant's employer would issue her a letter confirming the period of her employment, or that the employer would keep her on to perform cleaning tasks during the child abuse investigation. There is nothing in the objective evidence to support such findings. This is not the clearest of cases.\n[22] Moreover, the first RAD panel had already determined that a very similar plausibility finding made by the first RPD panel was in error. Specifically:\nThe RPD reasoned that the school where the PA [Principal Appellant] worked would not have continued to allow her to work around children (whether as a teacher or a cleaner) if she was the subject of a child abuse investigation [...]\nThe RPD's plausibility finding was not made in the clearest of cases. I could agree with the RPD if there were no evidence to the contrary. This is not the case. There is a letter from the PA's husband explaining that the police have questioned and detained him while looking for the PA. They questioned him about the PA's abuse and communicated their intent to arrest her.49\n[23] In redetermining the claim, the RPD did not explain why it was making this same finding which was already determined to be incorrect by the RAD. The RPD erred.\n[24] Counsel also argues that the RPD's plausibility finding related to the failure of the PSB to seize her passport misapprehends the objective evidence.50 I agree. The RPD referred to Item 10.7 in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for China in support of its finding that \"a person under investigation and surveillance by the police is required to surrender their passport to the authorities.\"51 However, Item 10.7 states that \"Chinese citizens who are under criminal detention have their ID and travel documents confiscated by the authorities.\"52 It also clarifies that \"it is unclear whether ID and travel documents are seized when a citizen is under investigation but has not been formally detained.\"53 I agree with Counsel's argument that this nuance is critical because the Appellant \"was never 'under criminal detention'\" and there are examples in the objective evidence of individuals who were questioned by Chinese authorities, but were never detained, who did not have their passports seized.54 In the circumstances of this appeal, I draw no adverse inference based on the failure of the PSB to seize the Appellant's passport.\n[25] Regarding the RPD's finding that the absence of a summons undermines the Appellant's credibility,55 I agree with Counsel's argument that the objective evidence indicates a summons \"may\" be issued, and that the issuance of a summons is discretionary and procedures are not always followed in practice.56 Federal Court caselaw warns against making assumptions about whether Chinese authorities would issue a summons.57 When the objective evidence \"provides that a summons 'may' be issued, it is not reasonable to determine that a failure to present a summons is so unlikely as to damage an Applicant's credibility [emphasis in original].\"58 In the circumstances of this appeal, I find that the absence of a summons does not undermine the Appellant's credibility.\nThe Appellant's delay in claiming is not determinative\n[26] The RPD found that the Appellant's nearly nine-month delay in claiming undermines her credibility.59 Counsel argues that the RPD misapprehended the length of the Appellant's delay and that an adverse inference on this basis is in error.60 While I agree with the RPD that the Appellant's delay in claiming does nothing to advance her claim, I do not find that this is determinative. I do not find that this delay rebuts the presumption of truthfulness of the Appellant's otherwise credible allegation that she was repeatedly targeted and threatened by X.T. and the PSB, as alleged. I also agree with Counsel the delay is seven-months, not nine-months.\n[27] I also note that the RPD drew an adverse inference based on the Appellant's daughter's decision not to claim protection.61 This is an error. The Appellant is not responsible for her adult daughter's decision. She remains on her student visa in Canada. I draw no adverse inference.\nThe RPD erred in assessing the corroborative evidence\n[28] The RPD assigned letters from the Appellant's husband, husband's lawyer, and neighbour little evidentiary weight.62 Counsel argues that this finding is in error.63 I agree.\n[29] While a Claimant's lack of credibility can extend to their supporting documents,64 corroborative evidence should not be disbelieved simply because a Claimant is not believed.65 Otherwise, a decision-maker risks reasoning in a way that \"begs the question at issue; it is impermissible to reach a conclusion based on certain evidence and dismiss the remaining evidence as inconsistent with that conclusion.\"66\n[30] Moreover, as set out by the Federal Court in Magonza, weight can only be assessed as a function of credibility and probative value:\nThus, weight is a function of credibility and probative value or, if one likes to see this in the form of an equation, weight = (credibility) x (probative value).\n[...] To explain this in mathematical terms, if the letter's credibility is zero (it is not authentic), then its weight is zero times its probative value, which always equals zero. In contrast, if the letter is authentic and has high probative value because its contents are closely linked to a conclusion of persecution, it can only have significant weight.67\n[31] In assigning the supporting evidence \"little evidentiary weight\" despite its probative value, the RPD erred. A document is \"either authentic or it is not. If it is not authentic, it should be given no weight.\"68 I can correct the RPD's error in my independent assessment. Having already set aside the RPD's negative credibility findings, I give this evidence full weight in my assessment.\nCredibility summary\n[32] Having independently assessed the entire Record, I find that the Appellant has credibly established her allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\nUnchallenged RPD finding that the Appellant lacks a nexus is correct\n[33] The RPD found that the Appellant's claim does not have a nexus to a Convention ground.69 Counsel does not identify any error in this finding, and I find none in my independent assessment. I find the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution by reason of her race, nationality, political opinion, religion, or particular social group. Having failed to establish a nexus, the Appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA. I will assess her claim under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nThe Appellant has established her claim against China\n[34] Having conducted my own assessment of the Record, I find that the Appellant has established her subsection 97(1) claim against China, and that she does not have access to state protection or a viable IFA.\nThe Appellant faces a personalized risk to her life under subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA\n[35] Having independently assessed the evidence, I find that the Appellant faces a personalized risk to her life that is not faced generally by others in China, under subsection 97(1)(b).\n[36] The analysis of subsection 97(1)(b) claims involves two stages. In my earlier decision70 recently identified as a Jurisprudential Guide (JG),71 I summarized these stages as follows:\nFirst Stage: Determine the risk faced by the Claimant\n* Clearly identify the nature of any ongoing or future risk.\n* Clearly identify the basis (or initial reason) for the risk.\n* Clearly identify the degree of the risk (or proximity to the risk). Consider any relevant factor, such as:\no The severity and number of incidents; and\no Any pattern or link between the incidents; and\no Any change over time.\nSecond Stage: Determine whether the risk is faced generally by others\n* Compare the nature and degree of the risk faced by the Claimant with the nature and degree of the risk faced generally by other individuals in or from their country.\n[37] This framework builds on the Federal Court cases of Portillo and Correa.72\n[38] First Stage: The Appellant was personally threatened with death on multiple occasions. X.T. assaulted her and threatened that that she will die for abusing her son.73 In XXXX 2019, her agent of harm also warned her that she will ruin her life until she is dead in jail.\"74 In XXXX 2019, she was pursued on the street by men who work for the Deputy XXXX who accosted and threatened her with harm. Once the police became involved, the matter escalated. Even after the Appellant fled China, her husband continues to be contacted by Chinese authorities. The initial basis for this personal risk-false allegations as revenge for disciplining a misbehaving student from a powerful family-is distinct from the nature of the risk itself-risk to life.\n[39] I find that the risk to the Appellant has increased in degree over time. It progressed from assaults and death threats at her place of employment, to a pursuit in the streets and at her home, as well as police interrogations of her husband even after she fled China. The Chinese authorities denied the Appellant's husband food and water. In my view, this is significant. There is a pattern of events that are connected through repeated threats and targeting. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant faces a personal risk to her life.\n[40] Second Stage: I find that the Appellant's risk to life is distinguishable in nature and degree from the risk faced generally by others in China. The general population in China does not currently face a risk to their life as revenge for disciplining a misbehaving student from a powerful family. In my view, the Appellant faces a high degree of proximate risk to her life. I note that the question is not whether others could eventually find themselves in the Appellant's position but, rather, whether others generally are in that position now.75 I find that the Appellant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that she faces a personalized risk to her life that is not faced generally by others in China, under subsection 97(1)(b).\n[41] Given that I find the Appellant's allegations credible, on a balance of probabilities, I further find that the risk that she faces is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions. Her pursuit by the PSB in China is based on false allegations in order to protect the interests of a powerful person, the Deputy XXXX of XXXX City. The Appellant's risk to life is also not caused by the state's inability to provide medical care. This satisfies subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the IRPA.\nNeither adequate state protection nor IFA are available to the Appellant\n[42] I further find that the Appellant does not have access to adequate state protection or a viable IFA in China, satisfying subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(i) and (ii) of the IRPA. It would be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to seek the protection of the state because it is the state that she fears. The Chinese government exercises its power throughout the whole of its territory. As such, the Appellant does not have a viable IFA anywhere in China.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJ. Pollock\nJ.

He alleges a fear of returning to China based on his religion, as a follower of the Church of Almighty God.1 In 2017, he alleges that his friend introduced him to the Church of Almighty God. In XXXX 2018, he alleges that he began attending an Almighty God house church. In XXXX 2018, he alleges that the Chinese Public Security Bureau (PSB) arrested a practitioner and his friend went into hiding. In XXXX 2019, he alleges that he fled China for Canada on an improperly obtained passport with the help of an agent. He made his Canadian refugee claim after his agent returned his genuine identity documents.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellant's claim, finding that he is not credible based on the following concerns: (1) He was inconsistent about whether he practiced in 2 or 7 house churches in China; (2) He was inconsistent about the time of day that he attends church service in Canada; and (3) His testimony about church service in Canada is vague. The RPD also found that his corroborative evidence is insufficient to establish the genuineness of his belief and that he failed to establish a sur place claim. The Appellant argues that the RPD Decision is incorrect. He has not submitted any new evidence on appeal, and I cannot hold a hearing.2\n[4] I am reviewing the RPD decision on the standard of correctness as I do not find the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage.3 The RPD does not have a meaningful advantage simply because it held an oral hearing.4 I have the complete RPD Record, including the RPD hearing audio-recording and transcript. My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. Having independently assessed the entire Record, I find that the RPD's credibility findings are incorrect. When the evidence is assessed in totality, I find that the Appellant has credibly established his Almighty God religion, on a balance of probabilities.\nDECISION\n[5] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES AT THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[6] The Minister did not intervene in the Appellant's claim before the RPD or the RAD. Further to the Federal Court's decision in Alazar, I have considered whether \"the case has materially shifted away from the RPD's decision and the appeal as it was framed by the [person subject to the appeal]\" such that procedural fairness requires me to notify the Minister before rendering my decision.5 I find that no such issue has arisen. The Appellant argues that the RPD's credibility findings are incorrect. He also repeats his fear of the Chinese state. China exercises power throughout its territory. The absence of state protection and an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) reasonably stems from the Appellant's fear of the state in China. Each determinative issue in this appeal has been raised in, or reasonably stems from, the Appellant's submissions. The RPD Record and Appeal Record were provided to the Minister.6 The Minister has sufficient notice of the issues in this appeal. There is no procedural fairness breach to the Minister in my finding that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nThe Appellant has credibly established his claim, on a balance of probabilities\nThe Appellant has established the genuineness of his faith, on a balance of probabilities\n[7] The RPD determined that the Appellant is not credible about his alleged religious practice in China because he was inconsistent about the number of house churches he attended in China as well as the time of day that he attends church in Canada.7 In my view, the Appellant's inability to recall with precision the exact number of house churches that he attended in China - whether 2 or 7 - as well as his inability to consistently recall the time of day that he attends church in Canada are details easily impacted by the fallibility of memory. I am also mindful that the Appellant has 9 years of formal education.8 The Appellant was consistent about the substance of his church attendance in China and Canada. The RPD also determined that the Appellant provided vague testimony about his religious practice in Canada.9 The Appellant alleged that members his practice group in Canada have different viewpoints about a passage in the Church of Almighty God text, The Words Appear in the Flesh. While he could explain his own views, he could not recall the differing views held by others in his practice group. In the RPD's view, the Appellant's inability to explain an alternate view is not commensurate with his alleged church attendance. Counsel argues that this finding is in error because \"[t]here is a difference between not remembering all of the details of one practice session and not knowing the precepts of one's faith\" and \"[t]he fact that the Appellant could not recall what his fellow members said on one occasion does not mean that he lacks religious knowledge.\"10 I agree. As Counsel points out, the Appellant provided the following detailed testimony about his practice in Canada:\n* His most recent experience with his Almighty God Church group took place on the weekend prior to the hearing when he spread the gospel at the Pacific Mall and told passersby about the Era of Kingdom.\n* On the weekend before spreading the gospel, he and his Church of Almighty God group gathered to study, pray, and eat and drink God's word. In particular:\no The group discussed the Church of Almighty God text, The Word Appears in the Flesh.\no The group discussed the birth of the Almighty God.\no Group members took turns discussing and providing different viewpoints about a passage from the Almighty God text.\no The Appellant provided his interpretation of the passage, being that when the Almighty God appeared, she appeared as a woman, and that this was the second time that God had appeared as a human being. He also said that Almighty God came to earth to save and free us, and thar she would finish the Era of Grace and to lead us to the Era of Kingdom.11\n[8] The RPD's finding is in error.\n[9] The RPD determined that the Appellant demonstrated knowledge of Church of Almighty God teachings.12 Having independently assessed the Record, I agree. I find that the Appellant has presented evidence of detailed, genuine religious knowledge. He correctly testified about a number of important tenants in the Church of Almighty God faith, including his favourite part of The Words Appear in the Flesh; the three eras (ages), including the Era of Law, the Era of Grace, the Era of Kingdom; when God appeared as a woman; how God defeated Satan; and the significance of lightening.13 In my view, the Appellant has presented sufficient evidence of sincere religious knowledge that is commensurate with his practice history and 9 years of education. I also find that his church letter, wife's letter, and photographs assist in establishing his claim.14 He has credibly established the sincerity of his faith.\n[10] In my independent assessment, I find the Appellant has credibly established his allegations, including his genuine faith as a practitioner of the Church of Almighty God, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe Appellant has established his claim against China\n[11] Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution upon return to China as a practitioner of Church of Almighty God, his fears are well-founded, and he does not have access to state protection or a viable IFA.\nThe Appellant's claim against China is well-founded\n[12] The Chinese state has declared the Church of Almighty God to be Xie Jiao, or an 'evil cult.'15 The Church of Almighty God is viewed as \"hostile to the government and dangerous\" and it is \"'persecuted' in China.\"16 Being active \"in any capacity in the [Church of Almighty God] CAG is regarded as a crime in China, and it exposes [one] to serious jail penalties.\"17 Practitioners are subject to arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture, and extra-judicial killing.18 The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) designated China a County of Particular Concern based on based on systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.19 The USCIRF notes that the Chinese government \"escalated its persecution of the Church of Almighty God, reportedly arresting thousands of its members throughout China and torturing many for practicing their faith.\"20 Having independently assessed the evidence, I find that the Appellant's claim is well-founded and he faces a serious possibility of persecution in China.\nNeither adequate state protection nor IFA are available to the Appellant\n[13] It would be objectively unreasonable for the Appellant to seek the protection of the state because it is the state that he fears. The Chinese government exercises its power throughout the whole of its territory. As such, the Appellant does not have a viable IFA anywhere in China.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nJ. Pollock\nJ.

He claims that as he is involved in a land dispute, he is a Convention refugee\/person in need of protection. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that he had an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Bengaluru. He has appealed this decision. Having reviewed the record, I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Appellant bases his claim on the following.\n[3] He was born on XXXX XXXX, 1997, and lived in a village in XXXX, Punjab. His father and his brothers inherited land from his grandfather. His great-grandfather thought that he should have inherited the land.\n[4] In 1986 his uncle was murdered by the Appellant's great-uncle and his sons. They were arrested but were acquitted. In 2013, his father went to work and never returned. His disappearance was viewed that this was linked to the land dispute.\n[5] The land is now in the name of the Appellant's mother. The great uncle and his sons threatened the Appellant and his family. They tell the Appellant's mother to give them the land or they will kill her sons. The great uncle is rich and one of his sons has a connection to a member of legislative assembly (MLA).\n[6] The Appellant has been attacked three times because of this land dispute. The first attack was in XXXX 2015 when he and his brother were returning to work. The Appellant reported this to the police, but they did not help. The Appellant believes that it is because of the son's connection with the MLA. The second was in XXXX 2016. Thereafter, the Appellant's brother went to Dubai. The Appellant went to Dubai as a tourist. After returning to India, he was attacked again in XXXX 2019. He came to Canada and claimed protection.\n[7] The great uncle has passed away, but the sons still want the property. When they see the Appellant's mother, they tell her to give them the property or they will kill her son.\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellant had an IFA in Bengaluru and denied the claim appeal. The Appellant has appealed to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). Upon appeal, he has not provided new evidence; nor has he requested an oral hearing. Without new evidence, the RAD does not have jurisdiction to hold a hearing.1\n[9] The RAD has provided notice to the parties that it may consider other issues such as state protection and the current version of the National Documentation Package (NDP).\nANALYSIS\n[10] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.2 In this case, I do not find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral evidence, and I do not see any reason to depart from this standard in this case.\n[11] I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and arguments.3 This review includes reviewing transcripts of the entire hearing. A recording of the hearing is on record.\nThe RAD will consider whether the Appellant is a person in need of protection\n[12] The agents of harm in this appeal are the Appellant's great-uncle and his sons. Their interest is in the land that is in the mother's name. There is not sufficient evidence to find that the Appellant is facing persecution because of any of the grounds listed in the definition of a Convention refugee. For this reason, the RAD will consider whether the Appellant is a person in need of protection in accordance with section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In the definition of whether a person is in need of protection, it is clear that an internal flight alternative is a determinative consideration.\n[13] The RPD found that the Appellant's account of persecution was credible. I note that the corroborative evidence is not consistent with regards to the attacks; there is more supportive evidence for the attack in 2015, and less for 2016 and 2019. Nonetheless, I find that the Appellant's account of events in India is credible.\nThe Appellant has an IFA in Bengaluru\n[14] The analysis for assessing an IFA has two parts according to the Federal Court in Rasaratnam.4 The first step is to determine whether there is a serious possibility that the Appellant will be persecuted, or whether he faces, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to his life, torture, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA. The second step is to consider all of the Appellant's individual circumstances and the conditions in the proposed IFA to determine whether it would be unreasonable to seek refuge in the IFA. An Appellant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or undergo undue hardship in travelling there and staying there. The hardship associated with relocation is not the kind of undue hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable. The standard is high and requires proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in travelling to and in living in the IFA location.5 An IFA will only be viable if both criteria are met.6\n[15] The RPD raised Bengaluru properly as an IFA. Having done so, the burden of proof shifts to the Appellant to show that it is not a viable alternative.\nThe Appellant is not a person in need of protection in Bengaluru\nThe Agents of Harm do not have the motivation to seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru\n[16] The Appellants argue that the behaviour of the agents of harm has shown a sustained motivation to persecute. The agents of harm have periodically harmed the Appellant for years. His mother is harassed by the agents of harm who tell her to give them the land or they will kill her sons. The last time that they threatened her was at temple two months before the hearing which occurred on April 13, 2022.7 When the agents of harm see her, they threaten her.8\n[17] However, the confrontation in the temple in about XXXX 2022 is the last confrontation on record. There is not any evidence of a confrontation since then. Further, while I find that this is evidence of a risk in the Appellant's hometown, it is evidence of a localized risk. The affidavits, the Appellant's narrative and the weight of the evidence in general leads to a conclusion that the risk of harm is localized to the town of XXXX, or, at most, the area of the Punjab. There is not sufficient evidence that there is a threat outside of this area or in Bengaluru.\n[18] The Appellant argues that even if he does not own the land, the agents of harm use him for persecution. The agents of harm have an interest in the property. The property is in the name of the Appellant's mother. It is not clear whether she could sell the property as it is also in the name of the Appellant's father.9 However, the Appellant himself does not own the property. I accept that there have been repercussions for him, but his link to the property is indirect. Further, I must consider the nature and the frequency of the harm resulting to his indirect relationship with the land to assess whether it would likely result in a forward-looking risk of harm envisaged by section 97. In this appeal, I have found that it is not.\n[19] Further, there is not sufficient evidence to find that, although it has been going on for years, the behaviour of the agents of harm is increasing. Rather, the motivation of the agents of harm is, at best, one that results in harm for the Appellant on an infrequent basis even when he is in the village itself. As an example, he lived in his home for about three months after the last attack. While he spent the first few weeks at home, he still went out with his uncle two or three times.10 He then returned to work. I have considered the evidence that his uncle and his boss were with the police, but the Appellant was not in hiding at that time. There is not evidence of another incident with the agents of harm. I find that this is a significant amount of time to be active in a location where the agents of harm would know where he is. There is not sufficient evidence that there was a barrier to them being able to harm the Appellant; and they did not do so.\n[20] Given that the Appellant would be in Bengaluru, there is not sufficient evidence to find that they would have the motivation to go there to harm him there.\n[21] However, even if they did have the motivation to seek and harm the Appellant in Bangaluru, there is insufficient evidence that they would have the means to do so.\nThe agents of harm do not have the means to seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru\n[22] The Appellant argues that one of the sons has a relationship with the XXXX MLA. Further, this relationship would enable the agents of harm to seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru.\n[23] However, in the appeal, the evidence about the MLA is vague. Although the Appellant had sufficient opportunity to provide sufficient evidence that it is likely that this MLA could help the agents of harm to harm the Appellant in Bengaluru, he has not done so. There is not evidence of the name of the MLA or which party he belongs to. There is not evidence of whether he is still in the legislature or not. How the son is connected to the MLA is not shown in the evidence. In short, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that it is likely that this relationship would assist the agents of harm to seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru.\n[24] Further, while the agents of harm have financial resources, the Appellant has not shown how this would lead to a greater likelihood that they would have the means to find and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru. He has not shown how the agents of harm would use this resource to seek the Appellant in a different state. The Appellant testified that the agents of harm had connections outside of the village and paid people to do \"dirty deeds.\"11 However I find that this evidence, too, is vague. He did not cite any examples or provide any information about who these people were and where they were located. It is not sufficient evidence to find that it is likely that the agents of harm would be able to mobilize people to harm him in Bengaluru.\n[25] The Appellant has the burden of proof to show that there is likely a risk to life, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. He has had every opportunity to provide evidence. He was represented both at the RAD and at the RPD. There is insufficient evidence of any barrier to provide evidence. However, he has not discharged this burden.\n[26] While the police in the Appellant's hometown might not be helpful, it is unlikely that there would be a need for help as the agents of harm would not seek and harm the Appellant in Bengaluru.\n[27] The Appellant argues that the MLA could use his influence to find him through the tenant verification system; however, I find that there is not sufficient evidence to find that this is likely. He quotes the opening paragraph of an Immigration and Refugee Board Response to Information Request which states that tenant verification is to maintain a database for people living in a particular area.12 He argues that one does not need to be searched for a crime by the police to be found through the tenant verification system. Rather, the agents of harm could find him through the MLA as he would be registered with the police. However, I have pointed out the issues with the evidence regarding the MLA; there is not enough information on record to find that there is a likelihood that he or she could help the agents of harm. Further, it is speculative to conclude that an MLA would use his influence to locate the tenant registry in Bengaluru. There is not sufficient evidence to find that it is likely that this would occur.\n[28] Further, the Appellant is not being sought by the police; hence, registering with the tenant verification is not likely to expose him. Similarly, should he use his Aadhaar card, there is not sufficient evidence to find that there is a likelihood that the agents of harm could locate him.\n[29] The Appellant did not dispute findings regarding population and location. Having reviewed the record, I see no reason to interfere with that finding to prevent an injustice.13 Having performed an independent review of the record, I do not find a reason to interfere with the RPD's findings that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that there is an MLA who has influence over the police.\nIt is reasonable for the Appellant to relocate and live in Bengaluru\n[30] Each analysis of whether there is undue hardship must take into consideration an appellant's individual characteristics. In this appeal, the Appellant is young; he is about 25 years old. There is not a record of any health concerns. He has a XXXX XXXX education. He is Sikh. He speaks some Hindi and Punjabi.\n[31] Upon appeal, the Appellant did not challenge RPD's reasonableness findings. Appellants who do not challenge the RPD's findings do so upon their own peril.14 Having reviewed the evidence, I do not find that there is a reason to find otherwise. As an example, it is likely that the Appellant could find work in Bengaluru. At the hearing, the Appellant stated that there was the possibility that he could find work there.15 He has worked in XXXX16 and as a XXXX in Canada.17 The evidence leads to the conclusion that he could find work in Bengaluru.\n[32] There are issues with housing in India; but as it is likely that the Appellant would find work, it is also likely that he would have the means to acquire housing.\n[33] The main languages in Karnataka are Kannada, Urdu and Telugu; however, Hindi is spoken by 43.6% of the population in India and is the predominant language.18 I do not find that this is a sufficient challenge to present the life-threatening type of hardship that meets the threshold of undue hardship.\n[34] For these reasons, I find that even on a cumulative basis, the Appellant would not face undue hardship should he have to relocate and live in Bengaluru. It is not unreasonable for him to do so.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPatricia Broad\nPatricia Broad\nJanuary 11, 2023\nDate\n1 Section 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\n2 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

He lived with his family in XXXX in the Bekaa Valley, an area that is well-known for its significant Hezbollah presence and influence. He has XXXX XXXX and work experience in XXXX with a specialization in XXXX, including XXXX.\n[3] He claims to fear returning to Lebanon owing to repeated attempts by Hezbollah members to recruit him in XXXX 2021, given his very specific set of skills and expertise. He also claims that the discrimination he faces, as a stateless Palestinian in Lebanon, amounts to persecution.\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) did not dispute the credibility of the Appellant's assertions but found that his fear of being forcibly recruited by Hezbollah was speculative and did not relate to a Convention ground. It further found that the discrimination the Appellant would face, owing to his race and nationality (or lack thereof) as a stateless Palestinian, would not rise to the level of persecution.1 These findings are all contested on appeal2, and I will explain why I agree with the Appellant that they are incorrect. I find that the RPD erred in its assessment of the evidence, including the country conditions evidence.\n[5] The determinative issue before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) therefore relates to the Appellant's forward-looking risk if he returns to Lebanon. I find that he is a refugee.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n[6] The role of the RAD is to intervene when the RPD is wrong in law, in fact, or in fact and law. I reviewed the decision of the RPD by applying the correctness standard.3 I conducted an independent review of the evidence, including the audio-recording of the hearing. As such, I agree with the Appellant that the RPD had no meaningful advantage.\n[7] I am not making a decision about the admissibility of the new evidence tendered by the Appellant as I find that the evidence on the record from the RPD is already sufficient to enable me to reach a decision to grant Convention refugee status to the Appellant without an oral hearing pursuant to ss. 110(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nANALYSIS\n[8] On my own assessment, I find that the RPD incorrectly assessed the Appellant's forward-looking risk of forced recruitment by Hezbollah (see below - i.). I will also explain why the evidence on the record is sufficient to establish a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellant on the basis of his profile as a stateless Palestinian in Lebanon (see below - ii.).\ni. The Appellant's Risk from Hezbollah\na) The Appellant established a forward-looking risk from Hezbollah\n[9] The RPD did not dispute the credibility of the Appellant's assertions but found that his fear of being forcibly recruited by Hezbollah was \"speculative and not grounded in evidence\" as well \"based on hearsay from his family.\"4\n[10] The Appellant argues that the RPD misapprehended the evidence regarding his risk from Hezbollah who made repeated attempts to recruit him. He disputes the finding according to which Hezbollah would not have an enduring motivation in pursuing him despite his knowledge of XXXX and XXXX, repeated attempts to recruit him, and the threats made to him if he refused.\n[11] I agree with the Appellant.\n[12] The RPD is expected to rely on common sense when assessing the Appellant's evidence5 and it seems self-evident that the Appellant's knowledge and skills in XXXX and XXXX would be of high interest to an organization like Hezbollah. He did indeed testify to the fact that this was the basis of their interest and was asked to go to Iran in order train others on operating, assembling, and repairing XXXX.6 I see no reason to believe that the Appellant would no longer be of interest if he returned today, given his very specific, rare, and valuable set of skills.\n[13] It seems to me that finding otherwise rather indicates a lack of familiarity with, or understanding of, country conditions showing the involvement of Hezbollah in various conflicts throughout the region, its extensive security apparatus throughout Lebanon (and beyond), the fact that it controls and gathers all intelligence coming in and out of Beirut international airport (the only international airport in the country), as well as its known practice of recruiting disenfranchised youths and other vulnerable individuals to further its aims.7 It also disregards the Appellant's testimony that he was told his life would be ruined if he refused to work for them.8 The Appellant's belief that he continues to be at risk is further bolstered by the evidence showing that the Bekaa Valley, where he previously resided with his family on the outskirts of a Palestinian refugee camp, is entirely under the control and influence of Hezbollah and its member operate there with impunity.9\n[14] Thus, the Appellant's explanation that large pick-up trucks with tinted windows patrolling the streets in front of his house were likely Hezbollah members attempting to intimidate his family - in an impoverished area where they do not normally patrol10 - is not mere speculation but rather a reasoned inference based on his own direct knowledge and understanding of the socio-political context - which the RPD failed to sufficiently consider or understand.\n[15] Overall, I find that the past threats and interest in the Appellant - given his very specific, rare, and valuable skills - are sufficient to establish that he would continue to be of high interest to Hezbollah if he was to return to an area under their influence and control, on a balance of probabilities. There is no evidence that Hezbollah has lost interest in him or individuals with his specific set of skills.\n[16] I also find that the above-cited evidence establishes that Hezbollah, as an organization, would become aware of his return to Lebanon immediately or soon after his return through the intelligence gathered at Beirut international airport, the only international airport in the country. It further accounts for the fact that they did not continue to seek him through his family following his departure from Lebanon, given that they would have become aware of his departure shortly following the fact. It is therefore not surprising that they have not continued to search for him, through family members, given this.\n[17] In this respect, I find this case similar to that of Ali, where the Justice XXXX explained that the absence of continued efforts by agents of harm [the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) network in that case] could not be equated to a lack interest where the claimants had established a profile that would be of high interest to the TTP, and that the latter were aware of the fact that their targets were outside of the country, and had previously threatened to kill them if they return.11 It was also noted that their family members, who remained in an area under TTP control, could not be expected to put their own lives in danger by denying knowledge of or misleading an agents of harm as to a refugee claimant's whereabouts.12\n[18] Similarly here, I find that Hezbollah would surely become aware of the Appellant's return through the intelligence gathered at the airport and\/or in the Bekaa Valley, and the Appellant's family remains in the same area, an area under the control and influence of Hezbollah. It would not be reasonable for them to be expected to put their own lives in danger if questioned about the Appellant's whereabouts even if he attempted to relocate elsewhere in Lebanon to an area that is currently not under Hezbollah control. I will say more about this below.\nb) No state protection or internal flight alternative\n[19] The country evidence establishes that Hezbollah controls a powerful network extending throughout the country and is able to locate wanted individuals within Lebanon and would have almost no problem locating a person, if they were serious about the matter. They maintain significant influence over parts of the country, and in some areas, the government is unable to enforce law.\"13\n[20] Further, some reports explain that because of the closeness of Hezbollah and the Lebanese General Security, Hezbollah can find anyone in Lebanon through them, and Lebanese security officials could not oppose Hezbollah. It can kidnap people to its secret prison without publicity.14\n[21] Additionally, Hezbollah's role and influence in Lebanese politics has expanded in recent years, thereby consolidating their reach and ability to track down anyone throughout the country.15\n[22] According to a report by the European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity, the increased Hezbollah control of Lebanese politics suggests a growth in influence of Iran and the Assad government in Lebanon.16\n[23] In light of this, the fact that the Appellant's family continues to reside in the Bekaa Valley, and the overall situation for stateless Palestinians of the Appellant's profile in Lebanon, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that operationally adequate state protection is not reasonably forthcoming at this point in time for the Appellant anywhere in Lebanon, and that he would have no internal flight alternative if he returns.\nii. The RPD Incorrectly Assessed the Appellant's Risk as a Stateless Palestinian in Lebanon\n[24] In addition to the above, I find that the Appellant has also established a risk owing to his profile as a stateless Palestinian, and that the RPD incorrectly assessed this as well.\na) The objective situation for stateless Palestinians in Lebanon\n[25] The Appellant argues that Palestinians face harassment and a high risk of arbitrary arrest and detention in Lebanon, as well as discrimination and restrictions on access to employment, education, public health care, social services, and property ownership. He submits that this discrimination and mistreatment rise to the level of persecution and cites case-law establishing that the various forms of discrimination he faces should be assessed cumulatively.17\n[26] I agree.\n[27] As defined by the Supreme Court in Ward, persecution is a \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\"18\n[28] The country evidence indicates that stateless Palestinians generally do not have basic social, economic or civil rights in Lebanon, and that they face discrimination and racism both from the state and broadly in Lebanese society.19 Their right to residency and mobility is subject to arbitrary change, depending on the political context.20 They also face an elevated risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, and torture and kidnapping from both state security forces and various Palestinian factions.21 This is compounded by the fact that torture is a pervasive practice that is routinely used by armed forces and law enforcement agencies.22 The country evidence also establishes that stateless Palestinians have been discriminated against by the Lebanese state for decades, that they face \"deep prejudice\" from community members, and that there are few signs that this will improve.23\n[29] Further, access to employment is very limited for stateless Palestinians, who are barred from working in some numerous professions despite new legislation designed to improve their integration into the labour market, and they also face discrimination and barriers in other fields. The jobs offered to them are often informal, without insurance and very low-paying.24 Their access to health, education and social services is limited.25\nb) The Appellant's particular situation\n[30] The RPD considered that stateless Palestinians are in a situation no different to that of foreign nationals, also facing various restrictions in Lebanon. However, the country evidence shows that stateless Palestinians receive poorer treatment than foreign nationals - in particular owing to the difficulties they face in obtaining and\/or renewing documentation - because they are the only \"foreigners\" who do not have the nationality of a recognized state, and therefore the law, \"deliberately excluded Palestinians from owning, bequeathing, or even registering property\".26 They face \"widespread and systematic discrimination\"27 by Lebanon society; this is not the case for other foreigners or expatriates in Lebanon.\n[31] The RPD also considered that the Appellant's ability to find and maintain employment in Lebanon and his high level of education, despite the various restrictions faced by all stateless Palestinians, was evidence that he would continue to be able to access employment opportunities and that these restrictions did not pose a substantial prejudice that would amount to persecution.\n[32] However, it did not address or consider the Appellant's testimony that he was subjected to exploitation by his employer who took away a significant portion of his salary each month and did not pay him for all the work performed on the sole basis that the Appellant is a stateless Palestinian.28 This is clearly discriminatory and exploitative; I find that the RPD incorrectly and insufficiently considered this. I cannot agree that the Appellant should accept to continue working under exploitative and demeaning conditions and face continued discrimination. In my view, the RPD did not sufficiently consider this factor in its assessment of the cumulative discrimination faced by the Appellant in all aspects of his life in Lebanon. The RPD was required to assess the cumulative impact of all the bases of concern put forward together to determine whether they result in more than a mere possibility of persecution.29\n[33] It also seems to me that the RPD failed to understand the significance of the severe and pervasive discrimination he faced throughout his life, and the Appellant gave emotional and highly personalized testimony attesting to its significant impact on him, and his life.30\n[34] In fact, I find that the RPD failed to consider or understand the implication of statelessness to one's sense of dignity and ability to the effectively exercise basic human rights; instead equating the situation of stateless Palestinians to that of foreigners who happen to be living in Lebanon; this is a fundamentally different situation, and it would be an error to equate the two.\n[35] In Ward, the Supreme Court affirmed that the protection of human rights without discrimination are the principles underlying the 1951 Refugee Convention (Convention31). Human rights and anti-discrimination are therefore central to the assessment of persecution and whether discrimination amounts to persecution in a particular case.32 These are also principles that underlie the objectives of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) that include upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings.33\n[36] I find that this is significant to assessing the Appellant's situation as an individual who has spent his entire life being discriminated against and facing various barriers to accessing basic human rights in all aspects of his life, which he nevertheless managed to overcome to access higher education and employment.\n[37] The Appellant has argued, citing the UNHCR Handbook, that when assessing whether measures of discrimination give rise to a reasonable fear of persecution, it is necessary to consider if they produce, in the mind of the person concerned, a feeling of apprehension and insecurity as regards his future existence.34 I would agree.\n[38] It seems to me that the pervasive restrictions on the Appellant's basic rights, coupled with the real risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, ill-treatment and\/or torture he faces at any moment, throughout Lebanon, is more than sufficient to produce a real feeling of apprehension and insecurity in the mind of the Appellant and that, taken together, they show that a serious possibility of persecution exists if he returns.\n[39] Given the socio-historic nature of discrimination endured by stateless Palestinians living in Lebanon that impacts all aspects of their lives, the severe limits on their basic social and economic rights, and their heightened risk for arbitrary detention, arrests, ill-treatment, and torture by various actors operating in the country, I find that the potential mistreatment and situation that the Appellant faces is both serious and systematic. I find that it amounts to a \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\"35 and therefore persecution; the RPD erred in finding otherwise.\n[40] I therefore find that the Appellant would also face a serious possibility of persecution if he was to return to Lebanon, based on his profile as a stateless Palestinian.\nc) No state protection or internal flight alternative in Lebanon\n[41] As mentioned, both state security forces and autonomous Palestinian security factions are known to subject Palestinian refugees to arbitrary arrest and detention.36 Reports also confirm the widespread use of torture and mistreatment in detention, and government officials enjoy a measure of impunity for human rights abuses.37\n[42] Based on the above, I find clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming or available to the Appellant. Moreover, given that the systematic discrimination against stateless Palestinians is prevalent throughout the country, I find that the situation would be the same throughout the country. I therefore conclude that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the Appellant in Lebanon.\nd) Conclusion regarding stateless Palestinians in Lebanon\n[43] I conclude that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution based on cumulative discrimination in Lebanon, and that the current situation for stateless Palestinians in Lebanon amounts to a sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.38\n[44] In my view, these considerations have the potential to apply widely to other individuals of a similar profile.\n[45] There are several decisions from this Board - both recent39 and dating back several decades40 - as well as from the Federal Court41, recognizing the ongoing cycle of exclusion, suffering, deplorable neglect, misery, insecurity and despair faced by stateless Palestinians in Lebanon.42\n[46] I see no indication that this situation has durably changed, given the above-cited country evidence, and I agree with Justice XXXX's prior assessment that stateless Palestinians in Lebanon face systematic discrimination that jeopardizes their capacity to attain the essentials of a safe and healthy existence.43\nCONCLUSION\n[47] To conclude, I find that the Appellant's profile, skills, race, and nationality (or lack thereof) will place him at risk of persecution or harm if he returns to Lebanon, that this risk extends throughout the country and that no state protection would be forthcoming, as outlined above.\nDECISION\n[48] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nDaphn\u00e9e Ouellet\nMarch 06, 2023\nDate\n1 RPD Record, RPD Reasons, at paras. 3-46.\n2 Appellant's Record, Appellant's Memorandum, at pp. 82-111.\n3 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of China. She fears persecution in China because of her Christian religion and her perceived political opinion. The Appellant alleges that she intends to convert to Christianity after her release from detention. The Appellant also discovered that her son-in-law is a previously imprisoned political activist while he lived in China and continues to be active in the United States. The Appellant alleges she had no knowledge of her son-in-law's political activities until she was detained.\n[2] This claim has a long and complex history. The Appellant left China on XXXX XXXX, 2022, and traveled to Dubai for medical treatment, accompanied by her son-in-law (YZ). The Appellant used a genuine passport to exit China. After her medical treatment in Dubai, the Appellant traveled to the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and eventually to the XXXX XXXX and Canadian border near XXXX, Canada. The Appellant and YZ intended to travel through XXXX to XXXX, where YZ and the Appellant's daughter reside. The Appellant used YZ's mother's passport and United States green card to travel from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the XXXX XXXX and XXXX. The Appellant was discovered to be using a passport and green card which did not belong to her. The Appellant's genuine passport was found in YZ's belongings. The Appellant was detained by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) on XXXX XXXX, 2022. She remains in detention at the time of this appeal.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the claim on September 27, 2022. The Ministers' representatives for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PSEP) and of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRCC) (herein collectively referred to as \"the Minister\") intervened on the issues of Article 1F(b) exclusion and on credibility. The Minister submits that the Appellant should be excluded because there are serious reasons for considering that the Appellant committed fraud by using a fraudulently obtained passport.\n[4] The RPD rejected the Appellant's claim in its written decision on October 7, 2022. The RPD found that the Appellant was excluded under Article 1F(b) or in the alternative, the RPD found that the Appellant was not credible in her refugee claim allegations.\n[5] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its decision. The Appellant was previously represented by counsel at the RPD hearing. On appeal, the Appellant is represented by an unpaid representative. This representative was previously found to be a Convention refugee based on his political opinion in China.\n[6] The Minister is intervening on appeal. The Minister provided submissions in its Respondent Record. The Minister maintains that the RPD's decision is correct, and the Appellant should be excluded under Article 1F (b) and is not credible in her allegations. The Appellant subsequently provided submissions in reply to the Minister's response.\n[7] The RAD carefully considered all the submissions and evidence in this appeal.\nDECISION\n[8] The appeal is allowed. The RAD substitutes its own decision that the Appellant is a Convention1 refugee.\nNew Evidence Application\n[9] The Appellant presents the following items as new evidence on appeal:\na. Radio Free Asia article dated August 31, 2022, with website address included;2\nb. Rfa.org printout dated November 2022;3\nc. Radio Jamming in China;4\nd. Application for pastor's oral testimony regarding the Appellant's conversion;5\ne. Christianity Ministry Program itinerary;6\nf. Partial transcript and translation of the RPD hearing;7\ng. Response to Information Request (RIR) dated XXXX XXXX, 2022;8 and\nh. \"Guilty plea\" letter to the Minister dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022.9\n[10] According to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),10 the RAD can only accept evidence that meets at least one or more of the criteria under subsection 110(4):\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[11] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, the RAD then must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before it is accepted.11 All three criteria must be met for the new evidence to be accepted.\nSome of the items submitted were already provided at the RPD hearing and are not new evidence\n[12] The Appellant already provided an article about Radio Jamming and a printout of the Christian Ministry program itinerary at the time of the RPD hearing and so this is already evidence that has been accepted.12 The RIR is part of the latest October 31, 2022 version of the National Documentary Package (NDP). The latest NDP is already part of the RPD Record, and therefore, this RIR is not new evidence, as it is already before the RAD on appeal.\n[13] The RAD will consider these items along with the rest of the evidence on the RPD Record in its decision.\nRadio Free Asia article\n[14] The Appellant presents this article which includes the date of publication, web address and author of the article.13 This article was initially submitted at the RPD hearing so the contents are not new. However, the Appellant submits that the RPD drew a negative credibility finding because the web address, date and author of publication was not visible on the printout in its decision. The Appellant submits that the initial printout did not include this information because her browser cut off the web address and date when she first printed the article. The RAD accepts that the Appellant could not have anticipated that the RPD would have drawn negative inferences based on the lack of web address, date, and author. For this reason, the article is accepted under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[15] The RAD also finds that the article is new, relevant and credible evidence. On its face, the article's web address, date and author information appear on the article, and nothing suggests this has been fabricated. This evidence is new in the sense that these details were not before the RPD at the time it rendered its decision, and this evidence is relevant to the Appellant's claim regarding her perceived political opinion. Therefore, the RAD accepts this article and will consider this evidence in its appeal.\nRfa.org printout rejected\n[16] The Appellant provides an updated printout of the website traffic report for Radio Free Asia to demonstrate that her interview with this organization likely came to the attention of the Chinese authorities, given that many of the users who frequent this website are from China. The statistics showing the level of website traffic and usage is dated November 2022.14 The RAD finds that this evidence arose after the RPD decision was signed on October 7, 2022. Therefore, it meets at least one of the criteria under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[17] However, the RAD finds that the contents of this printout are not new. Under the Raza\/Singh factors, evidence must be new in the sense that it contradicts a finding made by the RPD in its decision, proving a fact unknown to the Appellant at the time of the RPD hearing or a situation or event that arose after the RPD hearing.\n[18] In this case, the Appellant provided a printout showing the website traffic between March and July 2022 from rfa.org during the RPD hearing.15 That printout showed that the total website visits in July 2022 was approximately 4.3 million. In the Appellant's printout on appeal, the total website visits in September 2022 was approximately 4.2 million.16 The fact that there are millions of users who view content from Radio Free Asia is not a new fact. This was already considered by the RPD, even if the RPD did not give this evidence much weight. Hence, this printout is rejected as new evidence.\nApplication for pastor's oral testimony denied\n[19] The Appellant explains that her pastor had assisted her in her Christian conversion via WhatsApp and was willing to provide live testimony for her appeal.17 The Appellant provides her pastor's contact information. The Appellant explains that her conversion took place on XXXX XXXX, 2022, after her hearing and before the RPD decision was issued.18\n[20] Respectfully, for new evidence to be accepted under subsection 110(4), the new evidence must have occurred after the RPD decision is signed and not merely after the RPD hearing. After the RPD hearing, a refugee claimant can still provide post-hearing documents before the RPD renders its written decision. The Appellant was represented by her previous counsel for the RPD hearing. There is no explanation why any evidence from the pastor, either in the form of a letter or affidavit, could not have been provided in post-hearing documents before the RPD decision was signed on October 7, 2022. Hence, the explanation of the Appellant having converted on XXXX XXXX, 2022, cannot be accepted as it did not arise after the RPD decision was signed. There is no reason provided for why evidence from this pastor could not have been made available at the time of the RPD decision. As the Appellant was represented by her previous counsel, the RAD finds that it was reasonable to expect that the Appellant would have presented this evidence to the RPD before the decision was rendered. Any explanation of this conversion is rejected as new evidence, as it does not meet any of the criteria under subsection 110(4).\n[21] It appears that the Appellant is also making an application to call her pastor as a witness.19 However, the appeal stage of the refugee claim process is not designed to be a second attempt to prove one's refugee claim. Oral hearings are only granted pursuant to the criteria in subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.20 Hence, oral hearings are not automatically granted to all appellants before the RAD. The RAD can only assess the existing evidence on record and new evidence that meets the requirements under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, and the three requirements as described in the Raza\/Singh decisions by the Federal Court. Therefore, the application to call the pastor as a witness is denied.\nPartial transcript of the RPD hearing rejected\n[22] The Appellant provided a partial transcript from her RPD hearings, arguing that there were significant errors in interpretation which compromised the outcome of her decision.21 The Appellant provided an interpreter's affidavit indicating that in XXXX 2022, she provided the interpreter an email with audio clips of her RPD hearings.22 The interpreter's affidavit is signed XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022.23 The RAD finds that evidence of alleged translation errors arose after the RPD decision was signed and it meets one of the three criteria under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[23] The partial transcript must also be credible, relevant, and new before it is accepted and considered in this appeal. After reviewing this partial transcript, the RAD finds that this is not relevant evidence. The contents of the partial transcript are confusing to review, and it is unclear where the errors occurred and at times, it is hard to decipher who is alleged to have made an error- the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) interpreter, the RPD Member or the Appellant having misunderstood a question. Unfortunately, the format of this partial transcript is poorly organized.\n[24] At times, the interpreter interprets the Appellant's testimony from Mandarin to English.24 Other times, the interpreter interprets the IRB interpreter's translation from Mandarin to English25, or the RPD Member's question from English to Mandarin.26 On other occasions, the interpreter paraphrases the Appellant's testimony and explains what he believes the Appellant meant to say.27 The transcript also does not provide complete sentences in its translation. In one instance, it is unclear whether the RPD Member did not finish its sentence or whether part of the sentence is missing, as the interpreter transcribes the RPD as saying \"well,\" with nothing to follow.28 For a transcript to be submitted as new evidence, providing a fulsome translation of the alleged errors in translation is critical. Since only excerpts are provided in this partial transcript, there is not much context given to some of the questions and responses given, making it difficult to assess the impact of translation error on the overall testimony. As the contents of the transcript and the errors are not clearly conveyed, the RAD finds that it cannot properly assess the relevance of this transcript. For these reasons, the RAD rejects this partial transcript as new evidence.\n\"Guilty plea\" letter addressed to Minister\n[25] The Appellant provided a letter to the Minister dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022, admitting that she is criminally liable for knowingly using identity documents which did not belong to her, so she could reunite with her family.29 The Appellant further explains that she is willing to take \"punishments\" based on her violation of the law. She concludes the letter by indicating that she wishes the RAD to grant her refugee claim.30\n[26] The RAD finds that this letter is dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, which post-dates the RPD decision signed on October 7, 2022. Therefore, it meets at least one of the three criteria under subsection 110(4).\n[27] In its Respondent's Record, the Minister submits that this guilty plea is credible as it is part of the Appellant Record.31 It is relevant because exclusion is central to the issue on appeal. It is new because this is an admission in writing that was not before the RPD.32\n[28] The RAD agrees with the Minister and finds that this letter meets the three criteria under Raza\/Singh. The RAD has concerns about the contents of this letter unrelated to the new evidence analysis. However, the RAD will provide a more fulsome analysis of this letter and give it the weight it is due, later in this decision.\nOral hearing request denied\n[29] The Appellant is requesting an oral hearing pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.33 However, an oral hearing can only be granted for the RAD to question the Appellant on the new evidence which it has accepted. In this case, the RAD has only accepted the Appellant's Radio Free Asia article and the \"guilty plea\" letter to the Minister. The RAD does not find that accepting or rejecting this evidence would justify allowing or rejecting the claim altogether. The RAD finds that this the exclusion analysis as described under Article 1F(b) requires the decision maker to consider many factors aside from a person admitting fault. Furthermore, the RAD does not find the evidence from the article alone to justify allowing or rejecting the claim altogether, as the RAD also relies on other parts of the Appellant's testimony in rendering a final decision on her real or perceived political opinion. Therefore, the RAD rejects the request for an oral hearing.\nStandard of review\n[30] The role of the RAD is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.34\nAppellant is not excluded under Article 1F(b)\n[31] In its independent assessment, the RAD finds that there are serious reasons for considering that the Appellant committed a crime, by using a passport and green card that did not belong to her, to reunite with her family.\n[32] However, the RAD does not find that the Appellant's crime amounts to the threshold of a \"serious crime\". The RAD finds that the RPD erred in weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors and the sentencing range factor. Hence, the RAD does not find that there are serious reasons for considering that the Appellant has committed a serious crime. The RAD's full assessment is below.\nEXCLUSION ANALYSIS\nLegal framework\n[33] The RAD will briefly reiterate the following legal principles guiding its assessment. Article 1F(b), as set out in the IRPA, states the following [emphasis added]:\nArticle 1F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\na) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\nb) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;\nc) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n[34] Section 98 of the IRPA indicates that a person who meets the criteria in section E or F of Article 1 of the Convention is excluded from making a refugee claim and, therefore, not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.35\n[35] Hence, if the Appellant is found to meet the criteria described in Article 1F(b), then she is excluded from being found to be a refugee and having Canada's surrogate protection, and the merits of her claim will not be considered.\nAppellant's identity fraud does not meet the threshold of being a serious crime\n[36] A crime must also meet the threshold of \"serious\" for a refugee claimant to be excluded from making a refugee claim in Canada. To determine whether a crime is \"serious,\" as described in Article 1F(b), the Federal Court of Appeal in Jayasekara indicates that the following factors must be evaluated:\na. elements of the crime;\nb. the mode of prosecution;\nc. the penalty prescribed;\nd. the facts; and\ne. the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction.36\nElements of the crime\n[37] The RPD found that there were serious reasons to consider that the Appellant used this fraudulently obtained passport to gain an advantage for herself, pursuant to section 403(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada (CCC).37 She did not have a valid visa, she was willing to travel though various countries with no valid visa for the purpose of reuniting with her family.38 She was not aware of her son-in-law's political activities until after she reached Canada, so her initial purpose of using a fraudulent document was not connected to her fleeing China for her protection.39\n[38] In this claim, the RAD agrees with the first part of the RPD's assessment. In its decision, the RPD found that the Appellant admitted to using a passport and green card which did not belong to her on her journey to Canada. The Appellant also conceded that she knew these documents belonged to YZ, despite simply following his instructions. The RAD finds that the Appellant's actions meet the elements of the offence as described in section 403(1) of the CCC below [emphasis added]:\nIdentity fraud\n403 (1) Everyone commits an offence who fraudulently personates another person, living or dead,\n(a) with intent to gain advantage for themselves or another person;\n(b) with intent to obtain any property or an interest in any property;\n(c) with intent to cause disadvantage to the person being personated or another person; or\n(d) with intent to avoid arrest or prosecution or to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), personating a person includes pretending to be the person or using the person's identity information - whether by itself or in combination with identity information pertaining to any person - as if it pertains to the person using it.40\n[39] The Appellant admits that she used YZ's mother's identity documents to travel to the United States to reunite with family.41 The RAD finds that the Appellant misrepresented her identity for her own personal gain. Therefore, the RAD finds that if convicted in Canada, the Appellant would likely be found guilty of identity fraud, contrary to section 403(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nMode of prosecution\n[40] The RPD correctly found that section 403(1) is a hybrid offence, meaning that if the Appellant were convicted of identity fraud, she could be prosecuted either by indictment or by way of summary conviction.\n[41] Section 403(3) of the CCC is as follows:\n403 (3) Everyone who commits an offence under subsection (1)\n(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years; or\n(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.42\n[42] If the Appellant's offence were to be prosecuted by way of summary conviction, Section 787 (1) of the CCC indicates the following:\n787 (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, every person who is convicted of an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more than $5,000 or to a term of imprisonment of not more than two years less a day, or to both.43\n[43] The RAD finds that there is a wide range of potential sentences available for the Appellant, depending on whether she would be prosecuted by indictment or by way of summary conviction. The Appellant could receive up to 10 years imprisonment or at the very least, a monetary fine of not more than $5,000.\nPenalty prescribed\n[44] The Appellant has not been charged with any criminal offence in any country, so there has not been any penalty prescribed.\nThe facts\n[45] The facts are not being challenged by any party to this proceeding. The Appellant knowingly used her son-in-law (YZ)'s mother's passport and green card to travel through various countries to her destination in the United States to reunite with her daughter and grandchild. The Appellant did not know about her son-in-law's political profile until after she was detained by CBSA in custody on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2022. The Appellant only admitted that the identity documents were not her own when her genuine passport was found in YZ's bag. Her genuine personal identity and citizenship are not in dispute.\nAggravating factors\n[46] The RPD found that there were numerous aggravating factors in the Appellant's claim. They include the following:\na. The Appellant lied to United States Border Officers when questioned about the fraudulently obtained identity documents she used to enter the United States. The Appellant only admitted her wrongdoing once her genuine passport was found in YZ's bag.44\nb. The Appellant traveled under a different identity and used these documents to enter XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and then XXXX XXXX. The repeated use of a different identity is aggravating.45\nc. The Appellant decided to use the fraudulently obtained identity documents to travel after her United States visa was refused in 2019. The Appellant's goal was to reunite with family. The RPD found that this was not a criminal purpose, but also not a compelling one.46\n[47] The RAD agrees that dishonesty to immigration border controls is an aggravating factor. The RAD also agrees that using fraudulently obtained identity documents to travel through multiple countries is an aggravating factor. However, the RAD notes that the use of these identity documents were all part of the same singular journey, to travel to the United States. This is different from a situation where a person may have regularly assumed a false identity to travel on various voyages over the years. While it is aggravating that the Appellant misrepresented her identity to immigration authorities in different countries, the RAD finds that the degree of aggravation is less than it would be, had the Appellant been a perpetual traveller with a false identity.\n[48] The RAD disagrees that the purpose of the Appellant's travel is an aggravating factor. The RAD also finds that reuniting with family is not a compelling reason for mispresenting one's identity. However, while it is not compelling, the RAD also does not find it to be aggravating.\nMitigating factors\n[49] In its decision, the RPD acknowledged mitigating factors including the Appellant's lack of criminal history.47 The RPD also found that the Appellant did not commit identity fraud for criminal purposes, for profit or for the benefit of or direction or in association with a criminal organization.48\n[50] The RAD agrees with the RPD's assessment of the mitigating factors. However, the RAD finds that there are many other mitigating factors which the RPD did not consider.\nNature of offence lacks violence, illicit drugs or weapons\n[51] In assessing the seriousness of the crime, the RAD considers Narkaj, where the Federal Court faulted the RPD for not considering mitigating factors including the absence of violence, the absence of any use of alcohol, drugs, or paraphernalia.49 In Jayasekara, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) provides guidance on the nature of certain offences that could exclude a person from making a refugee claim. The FCA held that the harm caused to the victim or society, the use of a weapon, the involvement of a criminal organization would be relevant factors to consider in assessing seriousness.50 The FCA also considered that the presumption of a serious crime might be considered in offences such as homicide, rape, child molesting, wounding, arson, drugs traffic, and armed robbery.51\n[52] In this case, RAD finds that the RPD did not consider that the nature of the Appellant's crime also lacked violence, drugs, or weapons. The Appellant is not part of an organized criminal group. The nature of the Appellant's actions is not remotely comparable to any of the violent and heinous crimes described by the FCA in Jayasekara. The RAD finds this to be a significant mitigating factor.\nHarm to society is minimal and Appellant did not commit a crime to fulfill a criminal purpose\n[53] The RAD acknowledges that using fraudulently obtained identity documents to travel is harmful to the integrity of a country's immigration system. However, the RAD finds that the harm to Canadian society to be minimal. The Appellant's use of these identity documents was to fulfil a private purpose, namely, to reunite with her family. The Appellant relied on her son-in-law's mother's identity documents without her permission. The Appellant had no economic benefit from her actions and did not economically deprive another person. The Appellant was not entering the United States and Canada to fulfill a criminal purpose. The RAD finds this to be a mitigating factor.\nSentencing range\n[54] In its decision, the RPD considered that YZ was charged under section 131 of the IRPA for counseling the Appellant to misrepresent her identity.52 At the RPD hearing, the Appellant's counsel argued that under section 131, YZ would only be subjected to a maximum of six months imprisonment, which is far below the 10 year or more yardstick for a serious crime.53 Consequently, it is unlikely that the Appellant would receive a higher sentence than YZ. The RPD agreed that the Appellant would be unlikely to receive a higher end sentence than YZ. However, the RPD concluded that sentencing range was only one of the factors to consider in an exclusion analysis. Considering all the factors, the RPD found that the crime committed met the threshold of being a serious crime.54\n[55] The RAD disagrees with the RPD's assessment of the sentencing range as being a minimal mitigating factor. The RAD agrees that the Appellant, if convicted by a court of law in Canada, would likely fall on the lower end of the sentencing spectrum; however, the RAD finds this to be a significant mitigating factor.\n[56] In Febles, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the ten-year or more range is a good indication of the seriousness of the crime and creates a rebuttable presumption.55 Hence, the severity of a criminal sentence generally reflects how seriously a court of law treats the impact of an offender's wrongdoing on its victims and society. The RAD considers this principle and the Appellant's likely low sentence range. Section 403(1) of the CCC is a hybrid offence, meaning that if the Appellant were to be tried for her offence in Canada, she could be prosecuted by indictment or by summary. The RAD considers the very wide range of potential sentences available to the Appellant from a monetary fine to the possibility of imprisonment.\n[57] Given that YZ was charged with an offence under the IRPA with a maximum sentence of up to six months imprisonment, the RAD finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant, if convicted in Canada, would likely receive a sentence well below the ten-year or more spectrum. The Minister has not provided any further evidence on appeal for why the Appellant's crime should be found to be serious despite the likely low sentence. The RAD is guided by the Federal Court's direction in Mohamed, Roshan Akthar Jibreel, and finds that this lower range sentence should not presumptively exclude the Appellant.56\nAppellant's \"guilty plea\" letter is given no weight\n[58] The RAD also considered the Appellant's \"guilty plea\" letter submitted on appeal in assessing the mitigating factors of this claim. The Appellant provided a letter addressed to the Minister, indicating the following:\nI have received a copy of the Notice of Intervention against me on XXXX. XXXX, 2022. I had my counsel read it and explained it to me, and I understand the nature of the intervention and would like to pledge guilty for this matter. I am entering my plea voluntarily. I understand that by pleading guilty, I will be admitting that I committed the crime which [the Minister is intervening].57\n[59] The Appellant further states the following at the end of her letter:\nI am writing this letter to you to ask for mercy and forgive me for my violations. I am willing to take punishments [based] on my violations. I do wish you could give me a chance to enter my refugee claim, I am really [fearful] to return to China. I do wish [the RAD] could approve my refugee claim at the end.58\n[60] In response, the Minister submits that the Appellant's letter confirms that the Appellant should be excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1F(b).59 The Minister further submits that the Appellant seems unaware that the refugee claim analysis ends when a refugee claimant is excluded from refugee protection, pursuant to Article 1F and Section 98 of the IRPA.60 The Minister also submits that this letter demonstrates that the Appellant unequivocally concedes to the offence for which she was excluded.61\n[61] The RAD has serious concerns about the Appellant and her unpaid representative's understanding of this \"guilty plea\", as doing so could contribute to her being excluded from making a refugee claim, defeating the purpose of an appeal. The Appellant does not seem to understand this very important principle, as she ends her letter by asking the RAD to accept her claim after she gives evidence in support of her being excluded and ineligible to make a refugee claim in Canada.\n[62] A plea of guilt could be a mitigating factor in an exclusion analysis if a refugee claimant admitted to wrongdoing prior to her arrival to Canada. For example, if a refugee claimant had criminal charges in her home country and voluntarily pled guilty and accepted responsibility. Pleading guilty after the Minister has proposed that the Appellant to be excluded is not a mitigating factor.\n[63] Most importantly, the Refugee Appeal Division is not a criminal court of law and has no jurisdiction to convict persons of crimes pursuant to the Criminal Code of Canada. To be abundantly clear, no actual convictions or legally binding pleas are ever brought before the Minister or a decision-maker with the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Minister is not a criminal prosecutor with the ability to pursue or withdraw criminal charges against any individual. The only role that the RAD, and every other decision-maker involved in the refugee claim process has, is to decide if there are serious reasons for considering whether a serious crime has been committed, in accordance with the legal principles set out by the Federal Court as described earlier this decision.\n[64] The RAD disagrees with the Minister and does not find it can assign significant weight to this letter. On the contrary, the RAD finds that this \"plea\" letter lacks probative value. Whether the Appellant wants to plead before a criminal court after RAD completes its analysis is not relevant to this appeal. Furthermore, the contents of the letter clearly illustrate that the Appellant and her unpaid representative do not understand the consequences of admitting \"guilt\", given that she is still requesting refugee protection, and this renders the \"plea\" to be less meaningful. For these reasons, the RAD gives this letter no weight in rendering its decision on exclusion.\nAppellant is not excluded\n[65] For the reasons above, the RAD finds that the Appellant is not excluded from making a refugee claim, as the crime of identity fraud does not meet the threshold of a serious crime. While the Appellant may be convicted of committing identity fraud pursuant to subsection 403 (1) of the Criminal Code of Canada, the RAD finds it unlikely, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant would receive ten years or more of imprisonment using YZ's mother's passport.\n[66] The RAD considers the context of the Appellant's actions. The Appellant's misrepresentation was meant to fulfil a single, private purpose of reuniting with her daughter and grandchild in Alaska. Regardless of whether it was the Appellant or YZ's idea to misrepresent the Appellant's identity, the danger to Canadian society is very minimal. This was a non-violent offence. There was no economic gain for the Appellant nor was any person economically deprived. No organized crime was involved. Article 1F (b) of the Convention is not intended to exclude all persons for whom there are serious reasons for considering that they committed a crime. The crime committed must also be serious, and the RAD does not find the Appellant's use of YZ's mother-in-law's passport to meet this threshold. Therefore, the RAD does not find that the Appellant's actions, even if convicted under Canadian law, are sufficient to exclude her from making a refugee claim.\n[67] The RAD will now consider the allegations of the Appellant's refugee claim in its inclusion analysis.\nINCLUSION ANALYSIS\nAppellant has a sur place claim because of her relationship to son-in-law\n[68] The Appellant makes her refugee claim based on her perceived political opinion and her religious conversion to Christianity. The RAD finds that the Appellant has a sur place claim regarding her perceived political opinion, given her relationship with YZ. The RAD will focus its inclusion analysis on this aspect of her claim.\n[69] The RPD accepted that YZ is a political dissident and had successfully claimed refugee status in the United States.62 However, the RPD found that the Appellant's fear of being persecuted by the Chinese authorities for her relationship to her son-in-law to be speculative on a balance of probabilities.63 The RPD considered that the Appellant participated in an interview with the Radio Free Asia program a week after she was detained by CBSA. The RPD found that there was insufficient evidence that the interview was published, on a balance of probabilities, and that it would come to the attention of the Chinese authorities.64 The RPD found that the Appellant and YZ lived very far away from one another when they lived in China, and consequently, the allegation that she would be persecuted for being a family member to YZ was speculative.65\n[70] Respectfully, the Appellant and her unpaid representative provides many submissions on issues and case law unrelated to any part of her claim. The Appellant also references parts of her new evidence to support her submissions in favour of her credibility. However, most of the new evidence has been rejected for the reasons described earlier in this decision.\n[71] In response, the Minister's submissions only concern the issue of exclusion and do not provide any new submissions or arguments regarding the Appellant's credibility.\n[72] Nevertheless, the RAD is still required to consider all the evidence on record. In its independent assessment, the RAD finds that there is sufficient credible evidence that the Appellant would be persecuted by Chinese authorities for her perceived political opinion, due to her family association with YZ.\n[73] None of the following allegations have been disputed by the Minister or in the RPD's decision. The Appellant is YZ's mother-in-law, and she is related to YZ through her daughter's marriage. YZ is a known political dissident in China and was previously expelled from his university and imprisoned due to his political activities before he fled China in 2017.66 YZ has provided scanned copies of the original court judgement and sentence from the Chinese government.67 He and his father have since received asylum in the United States.68 The RAD considers that YZ's family members have also become persons of interest to the Chinese government. YZ's father and grandmother were imprisoned.69 YZ's parents' property has been seized.70 YZ's previous girlfriend has also come to the attention of the Chinese authorities because her of past relationship to YZ.71\n[74] YZ's evidence regarding the surveillance and imprisonment of his family members because of their association with him is consistent with the objective evidence. China's authoritarian regime has become increasingly repressive in recent years.72 Chinese government officials continue to deny holding any political prisoners.73 However, human rights organizations estimate tens of thousands of political prisoners remain incarcerated presently.74 Government security forces also harass and intimidate former political prisoners and their family members. Authorities frequently subject former political prisoners and their families to surveillance, telephone, wiretaps, searches and other forms of harassment and threats.75\n[75] Based on the available evidence, the RAD finds that there is sufficient objective basis to find that the Appellant would come to the attention of the Chinese authorities because of her relationship with YZ, on a balance of probabilities. YZ is a former political dissident who continues to be vocal in his political opinion while living in the United States. Chinese nationals who engage in politically sensitive activities abroad continue to be monitored by the Chinese government.76\n[76] Since YZ fled to the United States, YZ's grandmother, parents and former girlfriend have all come to the attention of Chinese authorities. The RAD finds that this is sufficient basis to find that the Appellant herself could also become a person of interest if she were to return to China, because of her family relationship to YZ and perceived political opinion.\n[77] Furthermore, the RAD also considers that at the time the Appellant initially left China, she only informed them that she was going to Dubai for medical treatment in XXXX 2022.77 The RAD considers that the Appellant has since traveled to Canada and the United States with YZ and plans to reunite with YZ and her daughter. The Appellant cannot be expected to lie to Chinese authorities about her travels and her personal activities if she were to return to China. The RAD considers the overwhelming objective evidence regarding the Chinese government's efforts to monitor political dissidents abroad as well as their family members. The RAD also considers the Chinese government's involvement in transnational repression of its Chinese citizens abroad.78 The Chinese government has used illegal undercover operations to retrieve any of its Chinese nationals who may fall under the very broad category of engaging in corruption.79 The RAD finds that these country conditions give the Appellant a sur place profile due to her perceived political opinion. The RAD finds that the Appellant's travels to North America where YZ is known to reside, puts her at a serious possibility of persecution because of her perceived political opinion, if she were to return to China.\n[78] The RAD finds that the Appellant would not have adequate state protection, on a balance of probabilities, nor would she have a safe and reasonable internal flight alternative, given that the state is the agent of persecution.\n[79] For these reasons, the RAD find that the RPD's decision is in error. The Minister has not met its onus to exclude the Appellant. The RAD finds that the Appellant is a Convention refugee because of her perceived political opinion.\nCONCLUSION\n[80] The appeal is allowed. The RAD substitutes its own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee based on her perceived political opinion.\n(signed)\nM. Lee\nM.

They are a Sikh family from Punjab state who fear returning to India due to persecution by Indian authorities, including members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n[2] Their allegations are based on the Principal Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative. The Principal Appellant states that he believes in equality for all human beings regardless of race, religion, or culture. He claims to have been very vocal for the rights of minorities in India since his college days and that he became known for openly promoting human rights, including in his wife's home state of Uttar Pradesh. He testified that he supported the Shiromani Akali Dal-Amritsar (SAD-A) political party during elections, and he would explain to people their freedom to choose the candidate or party they liked.1\n[3] He was first targeted in Uttar Pradesh because he believed in equality for all religions. At first, he would get into arguments with people in Uttar Pradesh. He did not take these arguments seriously. Then BJP politicians by the names of IK and KT started to harass him because they did not want him \"helping\" people during election time. He eventually learned from his father-in-law that people were conspiring to kill him because people in the community wanted a pure Hindu nation. He was warned by his father-in-law to avoid visiting them in Uttar Pradesh, and he complied.\n[4] He claims his efforts to avoid trouble were too late. He states that, in 2014, he was framed in a false property dispute wherein it was alleged that he was stealing wheat from his own XXXX. He was arrested in connection with this lawsuit, held for three days, and brutally beaten. The matter proceeded through the courts, and he believes that the lowest court did not have the courage to dismiss his case and take a stand against police brutality. He was successful before the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which quashed the lawsuit as frivolous.\n[5] In addition to being a XXXX, the Principal Appellant owned a XXXX XXXX and several XXXX XXXX. He claims that, after the 2014 lawsuit failed, the police kept harassing him by impounding his XXXX without justification, which caused him to suffer huge economic losses. This did not deter him from continuing to raise his voice for justice and equality.\n[6] Then, in 2018, the Principal Appellant faced another lawsuit, this time filed by his father-in-law. The Appellants claim that the father-in-law was pressured by his community in Uttar Pradesh to file a dowry claim against the Principal Appellant, in an effort to break up the Principal Appellant's family. The Principal Appellant explained that it was quite easy to keep someone behind bars for a long time without a trial in a dowry case. He testified that he was unlawfully arrested for a second time and held for four days.2 The Principal Appellant was successful in having the court quash the dowry case.\n[7] However, before the court quashed the dowry case, the Appellants claim that their persecutors had published false articles in several newspapers defaming the Principal Appellant. The Principal Appellant began receiving death threats from the Indian authorities, as it was clear that their efforts to frame him in false cases had failed. The Principal Appellant's daughter testified that her father was threatened that they would hurt her, her mother, and her brother, if the Principal Appellant did not do what they wanted.3 The family became extremely scared for their safety and realized they could not live in India safely.\n[8] The Principal Appellant and his daughter left India first, in 2018. The daughter began studies in Canada on a student visa. The Principal Appellant worked on a XXXX in Canada. He returned to India in XXXX 2019 because his wife had a medical problem and because he had to arrange for his son's passport.4 The Principal Appellant returned to India in XXXX 2019 to bring his son to Canada. Then, in XXXX 2020, the Principal Appellant brought his wife to Canada.\n[9] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found the Appellants to be credible and gave full weight to the documents submitted in support of their claims. However, the RPD found that the Appellants have viable internal flight alternatives (IFAs) in Mumbai or Bengaluru. It found that the agents of persecution were BJP party contingents local to Uttar Pradesh, including IK and KT, and the agents of persecution did not demonstrate motivation to pursue the Appellants outside of Uttar Pradesh. The RPD also found that the Principal Appellant did not demonstrate that he fits the profile of having advocated vocally for an independent Khalistan and thus did not face a serious possibility of persecution due to his political opinion. Finally, the RPD found that there was no serious possibility of persecution in India due to the Appellants' status as Sikhs.\n[10] On appeal, the Appellants argue that Mumbai is not safe for them because Mumbai was one of the \"first laboratories\" of the nationalist ideology of Hindutva and because the BJP is in power in Maharashtra, the state in which Mumbai is located. They submit that Bengaluru is also unsafe for someone who has been supporting Khalistan, as it is home to India's most notorious central agencies' cyber-units. They submit that both cities are unreasonable given that the Appellants come from a state which is different, both linguistically and culturally and that, as farmers, they could not live in big cities. The Appellants ask that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) allow their appeal and find that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nDECISION\n[11] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[12] The Appellants seek to introduce new evidence with their appeal consisting of four (4) letters from the Government of Canada which acknowledge that each of the Appellants filed their refugee claims on September 19, 2020. The seek to introduce this evidence in response to paragraph 10 of the RPD's Reasons, which states that they signed their BOCs in January 2022. They explain that, in January 2022, they were asked to fix typographical errors, and that is why the Principal Appellant and his wife signed their BOCs at later dates.\n[13] I reject the new evidence. I find that it is not necessary to admit the new evidence to accept the Appellants' submission. This is because the immigration forms contained in the RPD Record and the BOC forms signed by the daughter and the son all confirm that the Appellants filed their claims for refugee protection in 2020, and not in 2022, as found by the RPD. I accept the Appellants' submission on appeal that the Principal Appellant and his wife's BOC forms were amended on later dates (in 2022 and 2021, respectively) due to typographical errors. I note also that this evidence is not relevant to the appeal as nothing in my decision or in the RPD's decision turns on when the Appellants filed their claims for refugee protection.\nANALYSIS\n[14] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.5 In my independent assessment of the record, I agree with the RPD's credibility assessment and find that the Appellants are credible, and they have credibly established their allegations. I find, however, that the RPD erred in its interpretation of the evidence, including its interpretation of the country documentary evidence relating to Khalistan supporters, which in turn led to its erroneous conclusion that the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in India by reason of the Principal Appellant's political opinion.\n[15] The RPD accepted that the Principal Appellant was a supporter of the SAD-A party but that he was not a member and that he continued to be involved with the SAD-A while in Canada. The RPD found, however, that this evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that the Principal Appellant fits the profile of having advocated vocally for an independent Khalistan. The RPD noted that there is no evidence that the Principal Appellant has participated in protests or referendums committing to the Sikh cause, nor is there evidence that the Principal Appellant has advocated for Khalistan while in Canada.\n[16] I view the evidence differently than the RPD. The Principal Appellant testified that BJP supporters threatened to kill him and his family because he is connected to the SAD-A, a political party which advocates for Khalistan and the rights of Sikh people.6 Country documentary evidence confirms that the objective of the SAD-A is the creation of a separate Sikh country, called Khalistan7 and that SAD-A members engage in activism, which includes participating in religious and political events and protests as well as advocating for and attempting to garner support for Khalistan. I find that this evidence is sufficient to establish that the Principal Appellant is an advocate for Khalistan.\n[17] I note that the RPD did not specifically ask the Principal Appellant if he participated in protests or referendums; rather, the RPD asked the Principal Appellant to describe his responsibilities. He testified that his \"job\" with the SAD-A was to tell people about their rights and to try to help them solve their problems. He gave an example that KT bullied a family to vote for the BJP, and he explained to that family that they should vote for what they want and who they want.8 He testified that he received threats for \"helping\" the people of Uttar Pradesh in the elections, and he was threatened to stop coming to Uttar Pradesh and to stop \"helping.\" Due to his support for the SAD-A during elections, and his implicit opposition to the BJP, the Principal Appellant explained that he faced repercussions by way of the frivolous lawsuits, unlawful detentions, and interference with his XXXX operations. While he managed to vindicate himself in the lawsuits, the death threats continued, and the Appellants ultimately made the decision to flee India.\n[18] I find that these facts demonstrate that the Principal Appellant and his family were targeted due to the expression of the Principal Appellant's political opinion. I note that country documentary evidence aligns with the Principal Appellant's narrative as it confirms local-level clashes between supporters of the SAD-A and members of mainstream Indian political parties, including the ruling BJP, and that members of the SAD-A are comparatively more vulnerable to state authorities than members and supporters of the mainstream national parties.9\n[19] The possibility of persecution is forward facing because the Principal Appellant testified that he continues to support the SAD-A from Canada, and from this, I infer that he would continue to support the SAD-A and Khalistan if he were to return to India.\n[20] Furthermore, I disagree with the RPD's interpretation that the country documentary evidence is mixed on the treatment of those who support Khalistan. The RPD acknowledged that there was evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) which supports a finding that Khalistan supporters face persecution in India (for instance, NDP item 12.8), but it concluded that the country documentary evidence was \"mixed\" because there are a number of significant items in the NDP (United States, Department of State report 2022 (item 2.1); Freedom House report (item 2.6); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report (item 1.5); Amnesty International report 2021\/22 (item 2.2); Human Rights Watch report 2022 (item 2.3)) that are completely silent on the issue. In my view, it is an error to give less weight to the items in the NDP which are directly relevant to the issue of the mistreatment of Khalistan supporters merely because there are other items which are silent on the issue.\n[21] I find that the Principal Appellant's fear of persecution due to his political opinion is objectively well-founded. Government, civil society, and media vilify Sikhs advocating for Khalistan as extremists and militants by default. The government is hostile to separatist movements. Security services are more likely to focus on Sikh separatists because they represent \"a perceived political threat to the unity of India\".10 Khalistan supporters are often implicated in false cases, and police forces harass Khalistan activists and their families and friends.11 People who support or advocate for Khalistan are monitored, often included on police lists for heightened security, and often charged in terrorism-related cases, which can result in being detained for years before being released due to lack of evidence.12\n[22] I find that there is no state protection or internal flight alternative because the state is the agent of persecution. The Principal Appellant's evidence is that his problems in Uttar Pradesh followed him to his home state of Punjab. Moreover, country documentary evidence confirms that police keep track of or monitor Khalistan supporters, and individuals who move to another city will continue to be tracked since that information will be shared. Based on my review of the country documentary evidence, I am satisfied that supporters of Khalistan are not safe anywhere in India and face persecution throughout the country.13\n[23] Accordingly, I find that the Appellants face a serious possibility of persecution in India due to the Principal Appellant's support for the SAD-A and Khalistan. It is, therefore, not necessary for me to directly address the Appellants' arguments on appeal that they are unsafe in Mumbai and Bengaluru because they are Sikhs. Also, in coming to my conclusion on this appeal, I have considered whether procedural fairness requires me to provide notice to the Minister that nexus and state protection are issues in this appeal.14 I find that these issues are not new as they are intertwined with the IFA issue as analyzed by the RPD. There is no unfairness to the Minister in finalizing the appeal without further notice.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.\n(signed)\nRosemary Basa\nRosemary Basa\nMay 25, 2023\nDate\n1 RPD's Reasons, para 6; Transcript of the RPD Hearing, p. 8, lines 42-48, p. 9, lines 1-10.\n2 Transcript of the RPD Hearing, p. 15, lines 1-27.\n3 Ibid., p. 27, lines 21-22.\n4 Transcript of the RPD Hearing, p. 15, lines 39-44.\n5 M.C.I. v.
