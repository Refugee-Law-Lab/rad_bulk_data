    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Data Source: Immigration and Refugee Board. In the Fall of 2022, the IRB added the Refugee Law Laboratory to their email distribution list for legal publishers of RAD decisions. The RLL therefore receives new RAD cases as they are released for publication by the IRB. Also, in the fall of 2022 the Immigration and Refugee Board provided the RLL with a full backlog of approximately 116k published decisions from all divisions (RAD, RPD, ID, IAD). \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Unofficial Data: The data are unofficial reproductions. For official versions, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Non-Affiliation / Endorsement: The data has been collected and reproduced without any affiliation or endorsement from the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Non-Commerical Use: As indicated in the license, data may be used for non-commercial use (with attribution) only. For commercial use, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. \n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Accuracy: Data was collected and processed programmatically for the purposes of academic research. While we make best efforts to ensure accuracy, data gathering of this kind inevitably involves errors. As such the data should be viewed as preliminary information aimed to prompt further research and discussion, rather than as definitive information.\n",

      "[1] I allow the appeal. The Appellant, XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Iran.\n",
      "Summary of the narrative\n",
      "[2] The Appellant joined the Green Movement (Persian Awakening) and was arrested on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2009, while protesting the result of the presidential election. She was released after 24 hours on an undertaking to refrain from participating in anti-government protests again. She XXXX XXXX at a university from XXXX 1999, until her dismissal in XXXX 2015, after having promoted the ideas of Ahmad Kasravi in a departmental chat group on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. Kasravi was an advocate of Islamic reform who was murdered in 1946. A supporter of the government read her posts and accused her of blasphemy on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. He also said that she should suffer the same fate as Kasravi. The Appellant and her family then began to receive anonymous threatening phone calls. She spent four weeks in Canada beginning on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, to attend a wedding. The threats to her life and those of her family continued after her return and until she left the country. In addition, the Appellant was detained for not having observed the Islamic dress code which requires that she wear a hijab. The most recent arrest took place on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, at a shopping mall. She was questioned and released after about two hours.\n",
      "Sur place political activities\n",
      "[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision was signed on July 11, 2018. New evidence has been admitted in accordance with Rule 291 of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) Rules.2 The Appellant engaged in anti-government protests in the XXXX of 2018 when she became a supporter of the Workers Communist Party of Iran/Hekmatist (WCCI/H) in Toronto. She filed photographs of demonstrations which she attended on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, at the XXXX Plaza on XXXX Street between XXXXand XXXX. She also filed photographs of herself participating in a protest at XXXX XXXX Square. The photographs were reproduced by means of screenshots from Facebook posts. The Appellant filed an Affidavit in which she states that her daughter informed her in XXXX 2020, of a meeting she had with the secret police. Officers met with her daughter in a park and asked her to tell the Appellant to stop her anti-government activities. She also provided an Affidavit from a member of the Central Committee of the WCCI/H in Toronto which confirms that the Appellant is a member of the party who participated in demonstrations against the Iranian government. She also confirms that the attached photographs are from her Facebook account as well as that of her former husband.\n",
      "RPD reasons for decision\n",
      "[4] The RPD concluded that the Appellant lacks credibility and a subjective fear of persecution for the following reasons:3\n",
      "i) The Appellant's conduct demonstrates a lack of subjective fear. She failed to claim asylum in Canada in 2016. She returned to Iran, and then delayed leaving the country in 2017, despite having a valid passport and Canadian visa;\n",
      "ii) The reason for leaving Iran is unreasonable and inconsistent with the actions of a person who received death threats;\n",
      "iii) The Appellant's testimony about having been dismissed from her employment and about having been targeted for posting comments in support of Ahmad Kasravi was inconsistent, evolving and not credible; and\n",
      "iv) The RPD cited the United Kingdom's Home Office Guidance, which indicates that \"[t]he level of discrimination against women in Iran, although severe, does not in general amount to persecution.\"4\n",
      "Reasons for the appeal\n",
      "[5] Counsel submits that the appeal should be allowed for the following reasons:\n",
      "i) RPD counsel was negligent. He failed to provide the Appellant with proper advice and to present issues to the RPD that he reasonably ought to have done;\n",
      "ii) The RPD failed to assess the Appellant's fear of her aggressive husband;\n",
      "iii) If the new evidence is accepted, the documents would justify accepting the appellant's claim;\n",
      "iv) The RPD failed to assess the issue of Iran's dress code and relied on the application of a foreign law rather than a Canadian law. It also failed to consider the country condition documents that undermine its finding;\n",
      "v) The RPD failed to address the key reason for the Appellant's re-availment and delay in leaving Iran which concerned her family; and\n",
      "vi) One alleged inconsistency can be attributed to the Appellant's misunderstanding of the RPD's question. Pain and medication may have affected her because she had been involved in a car accident one month prior to the hearing.\n",
      "Summary of RAD assessment\n",
      "[6] The determinative issue for the appeal is the sur place claim. The RPD correctly rejected the Appellant's claim. My independent assessment of the evidence led me to the same conclusion in XXXX 2020. The draft decision could not be signed and finalized because the Registry closed due to COVID-19. The Appellant applied to admit new evidence pursuant to Rule 29 on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, before the Registry reopened. I accepted it because all of the material facts postdate the XXXX 2018 Appellant's Record, it is reliable, and it has significant probative value. A hearing was held to explore issues related to the Appellant's credibility. I concluded that the Appellant's has established that she joined a banned political party in Canada and that she has participated in public demonstrations against the Iranian government. Photographs of her involved in these protests have been posted on Facebook. Police contacted the Appellant's daughter in Iran to demand that she stop these activities. Documentary evidence confirms that authorities monitor the internet for opposition to the government. Returnees are screened and those found to have engaged in such conduct are arrested. Interrogation can be brutal and imprisonment can be life-threatening. The Appellant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n",
      "DECISION\n",
      "[7] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is Convention refugee.5\n",
      "NEW EVIDENCE\n",
      "The evidence presented by the Appellant with her record is rejected, but subsequent evidence filed pursuant to Rule 29 is accepted\n",
      "[8] According to the law,6 I can only accept evidence that:\n",
      "i. arose after the RPD decision; or\n",
      "ii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n",
      "iii. that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n",
      "[9] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.7\n",
      "[10] The Appellant has requested that the following documents be admitted as new evidence:\n",
      "a. Pictures of the Appellant living a secular life while on vacation outside of Iran prior to coming to Canada;8 b. and c. Pictures of the Appellant living a secular life while in Canada;9\n",
      "d. and e. Evidence that the Appellant was translating aXXXX XXXX book and that it was\n",
      "published in XXXX 2016, including:\n",
      "i) A screenshot from Amazon's website showing the English version of\n",
      "the book;10\n",
      "ii) Screenshots from two websites which confirm that the Appellant's\n",
      "translated book was published in XXXX 2016;11\n",
      "iii) The translation of the front cover of the XXXX book she translated;12\n",
      "iv) The original published version of the book in Farsi;13 and\n",
      "f. Evidence of the Appellant's injuries sustained on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, including:14\n",
      "i) Pictures of her injuries;\n",
      "ii) A letter from her doctor; and\n",
      "iii) Hospital medical records.\n",
      "[11] Counsel submits that documents should be accepted as new evidence because the RPD counsel did not explain to the Appellant the need to provide them. She reasonably relied on the advice of counsel. Moreover, the RPD counsel failed to advance her claim of persecution on the basis of risk from her husband. Counsel did not adequately advance the claim based on her desire to live a secular lifestyle and not wear a hijab. In addition, counsel failed to advise the RPD of the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 accident and that she was taking medication because she was still experiencing pain. The negligence of RPD counsel should not cause the Appellant to suffer. RAD counsel requested an oral hearing, under subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).15\n",
      "[12] RPD counsel was not served with the Memorandum until February 1, 2021, over 29 months after the Appellant's Record was filed.16 Submissions were made without former counsel having been served as required by the IRB Practice Notice - Allegations Against Former Counsel17 and by Federal Court jurisprudence.18 The Supreme Court of Canada has set a high threshold to establish that counsel's representation before the RPD was inadequate.19 The Court identified four factors to be considered in the analysis: relevancy, credibility, whether the evidence could have affected the result, and whether the complainant exercised due diligence. The allegation of incompetence \"cannot be . . . used routinely to augment the trial record.\" As a result, it is only applicable in \"exceptional cases\" to be determined on a reasonableness standard. There is a strong presumption that representation \"fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\" The Appellant has the onus to make the case. \"The wisdom of hindsight has no place in this assessment.\"20\n",
      "[13] I initially wrote a four-page assessment of this issue in light of the audio recording of the hearing and documentary evidence and concluded that the Appellant had failed to make the case that she was not adequately represented before the RPD. The recent response from former counsel provides additional support for this conclusion. I also wrote a two-page assessment of the new evidence and concluded that it could reasonably have been disclosed to the RPD under all of the relevant circumstances. Given that this is not a determinative issue, I removed this material from the decision because it no longer serves a useful purpose. I also denied the request for a hearing because no new evidence was admitted.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[14] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.21\n",
      "[15] I wrote a rather lengthy assessment of the appeal in March 2020 and concluded that the RPD did not err in its analysis. Although I completed a draft decision in which I dismissed the appeal, it could not be processed because the Registry was closed due to COVID-19. The Appellant filed an application on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, pursuant to Rule 29 of the RAD Rules to admit evidence concerning her recent political activities in Canada. All of the evidence postdates the RPD decision and the filing of the Appellant's Record on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. The application has been corroborated by reliable evidence and is of high probative value. I admit it because it complies with Rule 29 as well as subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. A hearing was also convened pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, because the documents raise determinative issues pertaining to the Appellant's credibility.\n",
      "Rule 29 sur place claim\n",
      "[16] A hearing was held on February 11, 2021, in accordance with subsection 110(6) of the IRPA22 at which both the Appellant and a member of the Central Committee testified. Both witnesses were credible and without material inconsistency between them. The Appellant's knowledge about the WCCI/H was reasonable and consistent with testimony given by the Central Committee member. The photographs credibly establish that the Appellant participated in demonstrations which were posted on Facebook. Although no statement was received from the Appellant's daughter, the explanation that she did not want to put her at risk is reasonable in light of documentary evidence concerning state monitoring. I found no good reason to doubt the truthfulness of the Appellant's testimony. The fact that the police have not gone back to speak with her daughter is not significant, given the fact that the message has already been communicated and COVID-19 has likely affected the deployment of government resources. In short, the Appellant has credibly established that she is a member of the WCCI/H in Canada and that she has participated in demonstrations against the Iranian government which have been posted on social media. Iranian authorities are likely aware of her activities in Canada.\n",
      "[17] The Appellant's subjective fear has an objective basis in credible evidence. A January 2014 Response to Information Request (RIR) states that people who are known to have engaged in anti-government activities outside Iran are treated harshly when they return. Iranians are screened upon arrival, and there are numerous cases in which people who have engaged in protests against the government were detained when they tried to enter the country. This RIR also indicates that Iranian authorities monitor online activities outside Iran. Websites are closely monitored and authorities are very active in cyber-monitoring, including surveillance of e-mails and online chats. Authorities are aware of actions of Iranians in Canada. Although the closure of the Iranian embassy in Canada has reduced their surveillance capability, human intelligence is still being used to monitory the activities of Iranians in Canada, including the infiltration of activist groups.23\n",
      "[18] The current United States Department of State report gives clear expression to the significant risks to which the Appellant would be exposed if she returns to Iran. Violations of important human rights include severe restrictions on free expression, the systematic use of arbitrary detention, the lack of fair trials, forced disappearance, the use of torture, unlawful or arbitrary killings, and life-threatening prison conditions. The report identifies 610 prisoners of conscience who are currently being held in jail.24\n",
      "[19] It is abundantly clear for the evidence that the Appellant's return to Iran would not end well for her. She would likely be detained at the airport and held under dangerous conditions in prison. Her interrogation could be brutal and even include the use of torture.\n",
      "[20] The Appellant's political opinion creates a nexus between the stated risk and the definition of a Convention refugee on the grounds of political opinion. Given that security authorities are the agents of persecution, she has no internal flight alternative, and state protection is not available to her. She has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n",
      "[21] Although she would also likely experience treatment described in section 97 of the IRPA, this issue does not need to be examined further.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[22] The appeal is allowed. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the IRPA, I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n",

      "APERÇU\n",
      "[1] Il s'agit de l'appel présenté par madame XXXX XXXX et son époux, monsieur XXXX XXXX, citoyens d'Haïti, relativement à une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) rendue le 2 avril 2019, ayant rejeté leur demande d'asile.\n",
      "[2] Le récit soumis au formulaire de Fondement de la demande d'asile (FDA) est à l'effet que monsieur XXXX, l'appelant au dossier, affirme qu'il a travaillé entre 2007 et 2017 comme directeur XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Il indique que le XXXX élu en 2016 l'était sous la bannière du parti politique XXXX XXXX XXXX tandis qu'il favorisait le parti \" Réponse paysanne \". Il ajoute que le XXXX le persécutait grâce à l'aide de bandits à sa solde; ceci dans le but de le faire démissionner.\n",
      "[3] Il signale que le XXXX XXXX 2016, le XXXX lui a transmis une lettre pour l'expulser de la XXXX et que le XXXX XXXX 2016, des bandits ont tiré des coups de feu et des pierres sur sa maison, brisant une fenêtre et causant un choc à la tête de sa mère, qui a entraîné sa mort. L'appelant indique que le XXXX XXXX 2017, lors d'une manifestation, des bandits l'ont agressé à coups de pieds et ont brûlé son véhicule. Le XXXX XXXX 2017, il dit avoir été battu par des bandits qui l'ont suivi jusqu'à Port-au-Prince. L'appelant soumet aussi avoir été l'objet à plusieurs reprises de menaces de mort, avoir déménagé à plusieurs reprises et avoir fait appel à la police, mais en vain, car il s'agissait d'une affaire politique. Il signale que le XXXX XXXX 2017, il a reçu une lettre de congédiement de son poste de directeur XXXX. Il a par la suite fait des démarches pour être dédommagé, après quoi il a reçu des menaces à l'effet que des bandits allaient incendier sa maison avec sa famille à l'intérieur. Les appelants quittent alors pour le Canada le XXXX XXXX 2017, transitent par les États-Unis et ils indiqueront leur intention de revendiquer la protection du Canada le 8 janvier 2018, selon les documents au dossier.\n",
      "[4] La SPR a rejeté leur demande d'asile en raison d'un manque de crédibilité, considérant les nombreuses omissions dans les formulaires déposés.\n",
      "[5] En appel, les appelants soumettent les arguments suivants :\n",
      "1. Est-ce que la SPR a fondé sa décision sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon arbitraire et capricieuse;\n",
      "2. Est-ce que la SPR a erré en ne considérant pas toute la preuve présentée devant elle.\n",
      "[6] Malgré les omissions notées par la SPR, les appelants allèguent que le tribunal a erré en concluant qu'ils n'étaient pas crédibles et en raison de leur comportement en lien avec la crainte.\n",
      "[7] Les appelants demandent à la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) d'accueillir l'appel, d'infirmer la décision rendue par la Commission et de renvoyer les dossiers des appelants à la SPR pour un nouvel examen.\n",
      "[8] Les appelants ne demandent pas à présenter un nouvel élément de preuve en vertu du paragraphe 110(4) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés (LIPR)1 et ils ne désirent pas la tenue d'une audience en vertu du paragraphe 110(6) de la LIPR \"\n",
      "[9] Le représentant du ministre n'est pas intervenu en appel.\n",
      "DÉCISION\n",
      "[10] En vert du paragraphe 111(1) de la LIPR, la SAR confirme la décision attaquée, à savoir que XXXX XXXX et XXXX XXXX n'ont pas la qualité de \" réfugié au sens de la Convention \", ni celle de \" personne à protéger \" au sens des articles 97 et 97 de la LIPR.\n",
      "[11] L'appel est rejeté.\n",
      "PORTÉE DE L'APPEL\n",
      "[12] Pour des questions de fait et de droit ainsi que des questions mixtes de fait et de droit, la SAR doit appliquer la norme de la décision correcte conformément à l'arrêt Huruglica2.\n",
      "[13] J'ai procédé à une analyse indépendante de l'ensemble de la preuve au dossier, après avoir fait une écoute attentive de l'audience, afin de me faire ma propre opinion au sujet de cette demande d'asile et de déterminer si la décision rendue par la SPR est correcte.\n",
      "ANALYSE\n",
      "[14] Après avoir pris connaissance de l'ensemble de la preuve au dossier, tant testimoniale que documentaire, la SAR en vient à une conclusion identique à celle rendue par la SPR, selon laquelle les appelants ne sont pas crédibles.\n",
      "[15] Les appelants sont d'avis que la SPR a fait défaut d'évaluer adéquatement leur crédibilité, et que cette incidence sur la décision va dans la direction que les appelants ne seraient pas persécutés dans leur pays de nationalité.\n",
      "[16] L'essence même de ce dossier repose sur la crédibilité.\n",
      "[17] Le premier élément soulevé au mémoire consiste à affirmer que la SPR a fondé sa décision sur des conclusions de faits erronées et les appelants ajoutent tirées de façon arbitraire et capricieuse. Selon les appelants, le fait d'omettre certaines informations n'est pas fatal à la demande. La SPR a conclu que les appelants n'étaient pas crédibles en regard de leur témoignage et de leur comportement. Qu'en est-il au sujet du témoignage livré?\n",
      "[18] Précisons au départ que monsieur XXXX a témoigné en très grande partie, considérant que c'est lui le principal intéressé dans l'affaire. Après avoir confirmé que leur formulaire de renseignements personnels était complet, conforme, exact et à jour, l'appelant a mentionné craindre de mourir et que sa crainte remonte au premier XXXX 2016.\n",
      "[19] Interrogé au sujet de l'événement survenu le XXXX XXXX 2016, l'appelant de répondre que vers minuit, une heure du matin, des individus sont venus à leur résidence. La famille a entendu des bruits à l'extérieur et ils se sont enfuis à la dérobée par la porte arrière. Invité à relater ce qui s'est passé à ce moment, l'appelant de répondre que les bandits \" ont tiré en l'air pour ne pas réveiller le voisinage \". Il ajouta que des slogans étaient relayés pas les truands dans la forme suivante : si vous ne voulez pas laisser XXXX XXXX en bon terme, sinon cela serait en mauvais terme. L'appelant a témoigné avec détails sur l'incident du XXXX XXXX 2016.\n",
      "[20] Il a ajouté que sa mère malade est demeurée sur place et que les bandits ont cassé les fenêtres, jeté des pierres sur la maison, etc. L'appelant revient à la maison accompagné du juge de paix, afin de constater les dégâts suite au passage des individus. Dans le rapport des autorités ou si l'on préfère, le procès-verbal, on ne fait mention des slogans racontés par ces personnes. Considérant que les individus viennent menacer directement l'appelant afin que ce dernier quitte XXXX XXXX, il est étonnant que le contenu du texte ne fasse référence qu'à des bris physiques et non au cœur des intentions du groupe, soit le départ de l'appelant de ses fonctions. Pour toute réponse au premier tribunal, l'appelant de témoigner : je ne fais pas trop attention à cela pour mettre au rapport.\n",
      "[21] Un peu plus loin dans l'audience, l'appelant a ajouté un élément qui détonne beaucoup. Il relate ne pas avoir indiqué les slogans dans ces documents car \" je ne l'ai pas dit, je me suis pas tout rappelé, c'est au fur et à mesure qu'on parle \".\n",
      "[22] La SAR ne peut accepter de telles explications afin d'étayer un moment phare dans le récit parcouru de l'appelant. Depuis l'élection du nouveau XXXX et de son équipe, des tiraillements existent avec l'appelant car il soutient que les individus ne sont pas issus de la même famille politique et que le nouveau XXXX veut que l'appelant quitte son poste pour favoriser son fils qui prendrait la relève. Les explications de l'appelant en regard de l'événement du XXXX XXXX 2016 sont beaucoup plus précises et directes que celles contenues au récit et dans le rapport des autorités. La SAR est d'avis que ces informations auraient dû être colligées dans les documents et ensuite expliquées en cours d'audience. À lire le récit soumis, on pourrait déduire que des manifestants veulent s'en prendre à la famille pour des raisons financières. Toutefois, le témoignage à ce sujet est bien différent. L'appelant explique que les manifestants sont à la solde du XXXX, qu'ils viennent s'en prendre à ce dernier et que l'édile utilise des fiers-à-bras pour inciter ce dernier à quitter son emploi. Les slogans entendus sont pour le moins directs et non équivoques. Ces informations pertinentes ne se retrouvent pas dans le récit et le rapport du juge de paix. Pas un seul endroit, mais deux textes ne comportent pas ces informations importantes. Les explications au sujet de ces omissions ne tiennent pas la route. Le fait de dire qu'il ne voulait pas mentionner certaines choses et que par la suite, il affirme que ces informations lui reviennent, il ne s'est pas tout rappelé et que c'est au fur et mesure qu'on parle; ne peuvent être retenues. C'est une personne éduquée qui détient un poste important XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, soit directeur XXXX et ce dernier, dans son récit manuscrit, n'ait pas songé à mentionner ces informations d'envergure et de conséquence ne peut que nuire à sa crédibilité. C'est la base, le nœud gordien de la crainte de l'appelant et ces renseignements ne sont pas colligés dans les textes.\n",
      "[23] À ce sujet, la SAR est d'avis que la SPR n'a pas erré.\n",
      "[24] Un élément connexe mentionné au mémoire, traité ci-haut, concerne l'omission dans la plainte d'éléments importants, s'explique par le fait que l'appelant se méfiait des autorités policières. La SAR a bien écouté l'enregistrement de l'audience. Nous n'avons pas noté cet élément au cours du témoignage. Au contraire, l'appelant, de par sa situation de directeur XXXX, au fait de XXXX XXXX XXXX, a de son propre chef requis la venue des autorités afin de constater les dégâts dans sa résidence. Le rapport (pièce D-13) relate ce que le juge de paix a constaté dans la résidence familiale de l'appelant. Nous n'agréons pas à l'affirmation contenue au mémoire.\n",
      "[25] Un autre sujet abordé au mémoire concerne l'omission des événements survenus XXXX XXXX. Les appelants soutiennent que ce n'est pas un événement important au dossier. Quant à la SPR, elle constate l'omission, soit une rencontre avec un bandit.\n",
      "[26] Le témoignage de l'appelant est à l'effet qu'il a déménagé XXXX XXXX après l'incident du XXXX XXXX 2016. Il y serait demeuré environ un an. Il ajoute avoir demeuré à plusieurs endroits mais que XXXX XXXX fut une ville où il a habité. L'appelant fut interrogé en regard de son départ de cette ville. Il a répondu : ça va se savoir et me reconnaître. Il ajouta ceci : un des bandits m'a vu et il m'a fait un geste et je savais qu'il m'avait retrouvé. Prié d'expliquer cette omission au récit à l'effet qu'un bandit l'avait reconnu dans la ville XXXX XXXX, la réponse fut surprenante. Il a fait part au tribunal qu'il n'a pas prêté attention à cela et que s'il avait tout relaté dans les détails, cela aurait été trop volumineux.\n",
      "[27] Force est de constater que le récit manuscrit est d'une longueur relative de quelques feuillets. Ce qui est déplorable dans ce dossier, c'est de nombreux événements que la SAR juge pertinents sont absents du récit alors qu'ils auraient dû se trouver dans l'histoire. Pour reprendre les explications de l'appelant à savoir s'il avait relaté dans les détails, le sujet amené en cours d'audience n'est pas anodin. Un bandit le reconnaît et lui fait un geste signifiant qu'il était retrouvé et pisté. La SAR est d'avis qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un détail en regard de cet élément et que cette information aurait dû être mentionnée au récit, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Cela nuit grandement à sa crédibilité.\n",
      "[28] Les appelants mentionnent au mémoire que la SPR n'a pas tenu compte de l'ensemble de la preuve et ignoré l'événement marquant comme l'incident du XXXX XXXX 2017 dans la capitale. La SAR a méticuleusement pris des notes au sujet de cet événement. Qu'a dit l'appelant au sujet de l'incident du XXXX XXXX 2017? Il témoigne avoir rencontré un groupe de personnes. Il soutient avoir été retrouvé. À cette occasion, il aurait reçu des coups de pieds et de poings. Surgis un gros bruit, selon ses dires, et les gens de la zone sont venus. La police est appelée et les individus se sont enfuis.\n",
      "[29] Invité à donner des détails sur l'événement et les individus présents, l'appelant de raconter que les individus avaient le visage caché qu'il ne peut les reconnaître mais il affirme que ces personnes le surveillaient car elles connaissaient son horaire. La SAR a de la difficulté à établir le syllogisme entre des individus masqués, le surveillant et connaissant son horaire de déplacement. Comment peut-il faire un amalgame entre une échauffourée et des individus à la solde du XXXX XXXX qu'il ne peut reconnaître alors qu'il se trouve dans la capitale. La SAR est d'avis que cet élément aurait pu faire l'objet d'un paragraphe dans la décision de la SPR, mais considérant les autres éléments que la SAR juge essentiels et qui n'ont pas été rapportés par l'appelant dans son récit, ce dernier point est mineur.\n",
      "[30] L'appelant a déclaré craindre la nouvelle administration depuis son élection en XXXX 2016. Selon ses propos, le nouveau XXXX désire chasser l'appelant de son poste qu'il occupe depuis 2007 afin d'y asseoir son fils. Il a rapporté avoir eu des ennuis de toutes sortes avec le XXXX. Malgré ces embuches, ces menaces pour le moins explicites, selon l'appelant, ce dernier continue à travailler dans son poste. Il souligne exécuter ses tâches quelques jours par semaine. Suite à la lettre de congédiement (pièce D-10) - qui est pour le moins curieusement rédigée- l'appelant fera des démarches auprès des XXXX XXXX pour récupérer son poste. Il a relaté plusieurs événements qui s'apparentent à des menaces directes de le voir disparaître, mais l'appelant poursuivra son travail jusqu'à son départ du pays en XXXX 2017.\n",
      "[31] La SAR est d'avis que les démarches entreprises par l'appelant pour demeurer en poste au XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, le fait qu'il vienne donner une prestation de service \" timidement \", comme il l'a rappelé, à quelques reprises pour la population est incompatible avec la crainte subjective qu'une personne peut ressentir.\n",
      "[32] En conséquence, la SAR est d'avis que la SPR n'a pas erré.\n",
      "[33] Pour les motifs exprimés dans cette décision, la SAR est d'avis que la SPR a rendu une décision correcte et celle qui s'imposait.\n",
      "RECOURS\n",
      "[34] Pour ces motifs, la SAR confirme la décision de la SPR, soit que madame XXXX XXXX et monsieur XXXX XXXX n'ont pas la qualité de \" réfugié au sens de la Convention \" en vertu de l'article 96 de la LIPR, ni la qualité de \" personne à protéger \" au sens de l'article 97 de la même Loi.\n",
      "[35] L'appel est rejeté.\n",

      "[1] Le 1er août 2014, la Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) a reçu un avis d'appel concernant la décision rendue par la Section de la protection des réfugiés (SPR) le 17 juillet 2014 qui portait sur la demande d'asile présentée par XXXX XXXX (l'\" appelant \"). L'appelant est réputé avoir reçu la décision et les motifs écrits de la SPR le 25 juillet 2014.\n",
      "[2] L'appel est rejeté pour défaut de compétence, car il porte sur une demande d'asile qui a été déférée à la SPR avant l'entrée en vigueur de l'article 36 de la Loi sur des mesures de réforme équitables concernant les réfugiés (LMRER) dans sa version modifiée par la Loi visant à protéger le système d'immigration du Canada (LVPSIC). Conformément à un décret publié le 15 août 2012 dans la Gazette du Canada, l'article 36 de la LMRER dans sa version modifiée par la LVPSIC est entré en vigueur le même jour. Selon le paragraphe 36(1), n'est pas susceptible d'appel devant la SAR la décision de la SPR à l'égard de toute demande d'asile qui lui a été déférée avant le 15 août 2012. La demande d'asile ayant été déférée à la SPR le 26 février 2012, elle n'est donc pas susceptible d'appel devant la SAR.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "[1] Mr. XXXX, you are a citizen of Chad, you presented evidence before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD),1 and you stated that you fear persecution by the Chadian authorities as a member of the Gorane ethnic group who participated in a demonstration on XXXX XXXX, 2017.2\n",
      "[2] The RPD rejected your claim for refugee protection, finding that your allegations in relation to your arrest and the fact that the Chadian authorities are looking for you are not credible. It also found that you did not establish that you had been subjected to persecution in the past or had a well-found fear of persecution in the future as a member of the Gorane ethnic group.3\n",
      "[3] On appeal, you provided documents4 and submitted that the RPD erred in rejecting your claim for refugee protection. First, you claim that it did not comply with the principles of procedural fairness owing to issues relating to the interpretation of your testimony. Next, you allege that the RPD erred in its assessment of your credibility. Lastly, you claim that the RPD has not considered your profile as a member of the Gorane ethnic group who is perceived as a political opponent.5\n",
      "[4] I conclude that some of the documents you provided on appeal are admissible (I), but that there is insufficient grounds to hold a hearing (II). After analyzing all the evidence, I determine that your appeal must be allowed, and that your danger of being subjected to torture if you return to Chad has been established (III).\n",
      "[5] In the following paragraphs, I will explain how I arrived at these conclusions.\n",
      "I. EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n",
      "[6] On appeal, you presented a series of documents:\n",
      "* a psychological report;\n",
      "* letters from various people living in Chad; and\n",
      "* documents concerning the current conditions in Chad.\n",
      "[7] I find that some of these documents are admissible and that others are not, under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and the relevant case law.6\n",
      "Psychological report\n",
      "[8] An expert report must be examined by the RAD and the RPD in the same way, taking into account the expert's qualifications, the detailed nature of the analysis, the information that the refugee protection claimant provided to them, the length of time that the expert spent with the refugee protection claimant, and the question of whether the report is an inadmissible recommendation that goes beyond the author's field of expertise.7\n",
      "[9] The requirements of reliability and relevance are not simply decided by the rules of technical evidence. They are the basis that decision-makers use to decide whether to give probative value to the information available for analysis.8 The Federal Court recently identified elements that are among the factors to be considered when examining the reliability of an expert report, one of which is the methodology used by the expert to formulate their opinion, their field of expertise and the extent to which they are found to be impartial and objective.9\n",
      "[10] A section of a report which goes beyond the author's expertise and defends the interests of the refugee protection claimant is neither reliable nor relevant with respect to the primary findings under the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal in question.10\n",
      "[11] Both the RAD and the RPD must take into account the refugee protection claimant's medical condition, and a medical or psychological report would allow them to consider whether the refugee protection claimant's physical or psychological health could affect their behaviour during the hearing.11 It would be erroneous to make findings regarding the credibility of a refugee protection claimant without having taken into account their psychological assessment, for example.12 However, when it is based on a discredited story, a report provided by a psychologist, anthropologist or other expert cannot rehabilitate the refugee protection claimant's story.13\n",
      "[12] In short, an expert report cannot, by itself, establish the credibility of a refugee protection claimant's allegations.14 In other words, an expert report cannot be used as a tool for evaluating whether a refugee protection claimant's account is truthful. Furthermore, Guideline 8 is very clear in this regard:\n",
      "8.4 Experts should not offer opinions on issues within the exclusive jurisdiction of the decision-maker, such as the merits of the person's case.\n",
      "8.5 An expert's opinion is not in itself proof of the truthfulness of the information upon which it is based. The weight given to the report will depend on, among other things, the credibility of the underlying facts in support of the allegation of vulnerability.15\n",
      "[13] In her report, the psychologist states that she completed the evaluation in a few hours by using a list of questions aimed at verifying the severity of your depression. She identified the results regarding your depression, the corresponding symptoms and the importance of consulting a psychiatrist who could prescribe appropriate medication for you.16 I find that this section of the report does not analyze your health at the time of your RPD hearing and that, as a result, it cannot be used as an explanation as to why, at certain points, you had difficulty giving your testimony. Moreover, after listening to the recording of the RPD hearing, I find that you were able to provide your testimony in a coherent manner, for the most part, though there were times when you did not understand the questions put to you by the RPD. With regard to your current medical condition, since you did not testify at a hearing before me, your medical condition could not have affected your behaviour during such a hearing. Consequently, the evidence provided in this section of the psychological report is not admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n",
      "[14] With regard to the section of the report concerning the events that you and your family experienced, I find that the information provided is not evidence of events that occurred after your claim for refugee protection was rejected. Consequently, this evidence is not admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n",
      "Letters from various people living in Chad\n",
      "[15] The letters that you provided on appeal contain information that arose after your claim for refugee protection was rejected.17 For example, your former spouse stated that, on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, 2019, she witnessed agents from the national security agency (ANS) visit the family home. Your cousin, mother and two neighbours stated that they witnessed the ANS agents' visits to the family home and that the last visit was in XXXX 2019. An employee of a company that offers check-in and boarding services at the airport where travellers enter or leave your country stated, in his letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2019, that your name appears on a list requiring the company to inform the authorities of your arrival in the country. The president of a human rights association stated that, on XXXX XXXX, 2019, your father and mother informed him that they had been the victims of persecution and that, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, one of your cousins had informed him of threats that he had received from the military.\n",
      "[16] In my opinion, these letters contain evidence that arose after your claim for refugee protection was rejected and are admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n",
      "Documents concerning the conditions in Chad\n",
      "[17] The documents concerning the current conditions in Chad18 refer to evidence included in the latest version of the National Documentation Package on Chad.19 However, these documents are not new evidence within the meaning of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and are not admissible.\n",
      "II. ORAL HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n",
      "[18] I found that the evidence presented on appeal that was deemed admissible raised serious issues with respect to your credibility, but that it is not central to the decision with respect to your refugee protection claim, and that this evidence alone cannot justify allowing your claim for refugee protection. Consequently, the three conditions necessary for holding a new hearing under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA have not been met.\n",
      "III. ANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\n",
      "[19] I conducted my own analysis of the record, primarily by listening to the recording of the hearing held before the RPD.20 I concluded that the correctness standard of review must be applied.21 In my opinion, the risk that you would be exposed to torture if you returned to Chad is the determinative issue. Consequently, I will limit my analysis to this issue alone.\n",
      "[20] Based on my own analysis of the record, the RPD erred in finding that your testimony was vague and included substantial contradictions with your Basis of Claim Form and prior statements.\n",
      "[21] I find that you gave coherent testimony on the essential elements of your claim for refugee protection. I identified no omissions or substantial contradictions.\n",
      "[22] As your counsel noted in her submissions before the RPD, you have clearly demonstrated that you are a member of the Gorane ethnic group and that you were arrested during a student protest when you were looking for your brother. He was also arrested. He subsequently went missing and, according to the information obtained by your family, apparently died during his detention.22\n",
      "[23] Based on my own analysis of the record, your testimony regarding the treatment you were subjected to following your arrest also appeared to be consistent, the doubts expressed by the RPD during the hearing having been resolved, particularly concerning the question of whether or not you were struck on the back while your head was held underwater.23\n",
      "[24] During the hearing, the RPD asked several questions based on the information provided in the documentary evidence. The RPD pointed out that your personal profile did not correspond to that of persons who, based on this documentary evidence, are targeted by the Chadian authorities.24 In my opinion, your claim for refugee protection should not have been analyzed in this way. While it is true that the documentary evidence suggests that certain categories of persons are generally targeted by the Chadian authorities, this does not necessarily mean that your testimony on your personal situation is not credible.\n",
      "[25] Moreover, the evidence that you provided on appeal establishes that the Chadian authorities are currently looking for you.\n",
      "[26] The documentary evidence indicates that the security forces in your country are not adequately monitored by the civil authorities, and that these security forces are corrupt, arbitrarily detain people, and engage in extortion and torture. The documentary evidence also indicates that impunity is rampant in your country since the judges, many of whom are corrupt, are overburdened and subject to executive interference.25\n",
      "[27] In this context, I am of the opinion that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, that you would risk being subjected to torture if you returned to Chad, that the Chadian authorities would provide you with no protection, and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[28] For these reasons, I set aside the RPD's determination and substitute the determination that, in my opinion, should have been made, namely, that you are a person in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA.\n",
      "[29] Your appeal is allowed.\n",

      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the father, Principal Appellant (PA) and Designated Representative) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the mother and Second Appellant (SA)), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the children and Minor Appellants), citizens of Nigeria, appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated July 19, 2019, rejecting their claims for refugee protection.\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[2] The appeal is dismissed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "Allegations\n",
      "[3] The PA began working with his father and uncle at his father's XXXX in XXXX 2011. His father became sick at the hands of his uncle using black magic. In XXXX 2012, the PA was abducted and beaten by men who warned him to never return to the XXXX. Months later he went to his uncle's home to try to make peace with him. The uncle threatened him and he became unconscious, which he later learned was due to his uncle using black magic. In XXXX 2014, he travelled to the United States (U.S); his wife, the SA, and children stayed behind. Shortly after he left Nigeria, men broke into their home and the SA was sexually assaulted. In XXXX 2017, after the SA was followed in her car, she and the Minor Appellants travelled to the U.S. The SA filed a claim for refugee status in the U.S., however, the PA did not. In January 2018, the family crossed into Canada seeking asylum.\n",
      "[4] On arrival in Canada, the PA's identity was questioned. He was subsequently detained for a period of time before being released on conditions.\n",
      "RPD Decision\n",
      "[5] The RPD concluded that the PA's identity had been sufficiently established. In respect of their allegations, the RPD found neither the PA or the SA to be credible. It noted material omissions by the PA in interviews with Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and found that he had failed to claim asylum in the U.S. The RPD concluded that their delay in leaving Nigeria was inconsistent with the alleged fear.\n",
      "Grounds of Appeal\n",
      "[6] The Appellants argue the RPD erred by not accepting reasonable explanations offered by the Appellants and failed to adequately assess supporting documentation, including medical reports.\n",
      "[7] With respect to the SA, they argue that the RPD erred in its application of the Chairperson's Guidelines on Gender. Finally, they argue the RPD failed to assess the separate risk to the SA and her daughter in relation to the prevalence of sexual assault in Nigeria.\n",
      "ROLE OF THE RAD\n",
      "[8] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it.1 The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in the assessment and weighing of oral testimony heard, which, in particular cases, attracts a standard of review of reasonableness.2 Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "[9] I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and arguments. This review includes listening to the entire recording of the hearing. Further, I have considered and applied the Chairperson's Guideline 3 and 4.3\n",
      "[10] In my view, the RPD erred by determining that the letters from family, friends and neighbors lacked probative value as they did not testify at the hearing. Nonetheless, I have concluded that the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellants were not credible and that they failed to establish their allegations on a balance of probabilities.\n",
      "[11] The determinative issues are credibility, delay and the PA's failure to seek asylum in the US.\n",
      "The PA did not identify risk of fear in his interviews with CBSA\n",
      "[12] The RPD found that the PA made material ommissions that were not reasonably explained in two interviews with CBSA after arriving to Canada and during his detention. The interviews occurred on February 1 and 7, 2018. In both interviews, he was asked why he left Nigeria. He indicated that there is no work, no hope and no future for his family.4\n",
      "[13] At the hearing, he was asked why there was no mention of his fear of his uncle in the interview on February 1:\n",
      "\"A. (PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT): I said at the time of the interview, we had just arrived at Canada then. And the previous 72 hours, I hardly have any sleep. Then, so I was too tired so exhausted and also, I try as much as possible then to answer the question as much as I'm supposed to do. But I didn't because I think I misunderstood the questions. But I thought it was just a, it was a situation of we have to answer the question in a general way so that's what I did and also, I also thought probably it was a situation where I have to -... Given complication of my story so probably I have to sit down later be able to write the story properly and that is what I did later on and that is what I'm sticking with today.\"5\n",
      "[14] The RPD then reviewed his answer in the second interview on February 7. The PA responded:\n",
      "\"A. (PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT): I was in depression; I mean I was in detention then and I was too depressed too thinking about my pregnant wife having 2 kids to herself. Probably, I misunderstood the question as well then I just was talking in general terms as well talking about situation in Nigeria but not telling me my story.\"6\n",
      "[15] The RPD did not find these explanations to be reasonable. The RPD pointed out that the PA is well-educated, has travelled and lived in the U.K. and speaks English fluently. The Appellants argue that the PA should be given the benefit of the doubt. The PA adequately explained that he had recently arrived in Canada, hadn't slept for 3 days and misunderstood the questions. The Appellants have cited Hamdar v Canada Minister of Citizenship and Immigration7 for the proposition that claimants should not be found lacking in credibility for a minor omission or a failure to recount full details at the port of entry. I agree with this caselaw, however, I do not agree that the omissions in both interviews are minor in nature.\n",
      "[16] In Hamdar, the claimant was interviewed by the CBSA on arrival. He gave a description of the agent of persecution and some but not all of incidents that caused him fear. The Court found the RPD had erred by expecting the Port of Entry notes \"to have revealed essentially what was revealed in the [Basis of Claim]\".8 This is easily distinguished from the present case. The PA did not fail to mention some incidents of harm. He made no reference at all to a fear of harm.\n",
      "[17] The PA was interviewed by CBSA on both February 1 and February 7, 2018. In both interviews he was asked why he left Nigeria. Neither of his answers included any mention of fear of being harmed by his uncle. I note the PA has an accounting degree, attended higher education in the UK and speaks fluent English. I agree with the RPD's finding that the PA's explanation that he misunderstood the question is not reasonable. It lacks plausibility that he misunderstood the question, \"why did you leave Nigeria?\". This is particularly so in the context of he and his family having recently crossed into Canada illegally to claim refugee status.\n",
      "[18] In my own review of the record, I note additional examples in the following excerpts from the February 7 interview:\n",
      "\"Q: How did your wife reacted [sic] when she found out you were leaving to USA without them?\n",
      "A: It was hard but she understood that I was doing it to help our family.\"....\n",
      "Q: Why did your wife travelled [sic] to USA with your kids?\n",
      "A: To come live with me, there is no hope in Nigeria.\"9\n",
      "[19] Again, the PA's answers make no mention of fear of harm in Nigeria, either to himself, his wife or their children. The PA's answers omit the basis of the Appellants' claim for refugee protection as set out in their BOCs. Both the PA and SA testified that he left Nigeria because he feared harm from his uncle. The SA also testified that as a result of being sexually assaulted and followed in her car, she too feared harm from the uncle and for this reason left Nigeria.\n",
      "[20] I find these omissions are central to the Appellants' narrative and as such draw a negative inference. As the court in Sava v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)10 noted:\n",
      "[21] In a case such as this where the Applicant says he is apolitical and makes no claim of persecution at the POE interview and then makes elaborate claims in his [BOC] and during the [hearing] in respect of persecution, the Board is certainly entitled to draw negative inferences from that omission.\n",
      "The PA omitted his job at the XXXX on schedule A\n",
      "[22] The RPD also noted that the PA had not listed his work on the XXXX in his Schedule A form, which he completed on February 1, 2018 and swore to its truthfulness in the CBSA interview. In his BOC11 and at the hearing, the PA explained that he did not list his work at the XXXX because it was not full-time work, he did not have an employment contract and he did not receive a regular salary. The RPD found this was not a reasonable explanation.\n",
      "[23] The Appellants argue the RPD should have given the benefit of the doubt to the PA as his explanation is plausible. I disagree. The Appellants' entire claim rests on the PA's work at the XXXX and the uncle's harmful actions as a result. Failing to list his work on the XXXX is a material omission. Based on this omission and those noted above in the CBSA interviews, I draw a further negative inference as to the PA and SA's credibility.\n",
      "Attempts to continue working on the XXXX are incompatible with subjective fear\n",
      "[24] The RPD found that the PA's repeated attempts to return to work at the XXXX was not coherently explained by the PA. In conducting its analysis, the RPD referred to the PA's testimony that he was violently attacked and threatened with death on several occasions and that he and his father were made ill through the uncle's black magic. He explained that he wanted to have a clear conscience as his father had always wanted him to work at the XXXX. The RPD rejected this explanation as the PA is an educated and sophisticated person and it defies logic that the PA would repeatedly make efforts to return to the XXXX when he believed his uncle would kill him. The RPD further found that the supporting documents lacked probative value as there was no testimony from the friends and family. It also found that medical reports submitted by the Appellants were not sufficient to overcome the credibility concerns.\n",
      "[25] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by assigning little weight to documents from the PA's aunt, father and brother. They say they support the PA's efforts to resolve the family conflict and the pressure he felt to continue to work on the XXXX. They argue the medical reports support the PA's narrative describing the harm caused by the PA's uncle.\n",
      "[26] I also conclude that the medical reports are insufficient to overcome the significant credibility concerns noted above.\n",
      "Documents from family members\n",
      "[27] I agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred by deciding that the family letters were of less probative value because they did not testify. Despite this error, I do not find these documents explain the implausibility of the PA repeatedly returning to the XXXX.\n",
      "[28] The letters do provide some support for the Appellants' narrative. For example, the PA's father, brother and aunt all confirm there is a family XXXX and there has been conflict between the PA and the uncle. They do not provide any specifics with respect to incidents or dates for the most part. Nor do they provide support for the PA's repeated attempts to return to work at the XXXX despite his concern that his uncle would kill him. For example, the PA's brother's letter indicates that when the family realized that the PA was abducted and threatened and had a sinister illness inflicted on him by the uncle, \"we decided that he should do all he could to leave the country\".12 Similarly, the PA's aunt's letter indicates that she went to the uncle several times after she learned of a \"rift\" between the PA and her brother in XXXX 2013, \"so the two of them can manage the XXXX together, but he refused.\"13 She refers to the PA being kidnapped, unconscious for some days and being taken to the hospital several times without a medical explanation. Although she states that there was a financial, emotional and moral cost to the family, there is no information that explains why the PA continued to try to work at the XXXX despite fearing for his life at the hands of the uncle.\n",
      "Medical reports\n",
      "[29] The RPD found that the medical reports did little to corroborate the allegations, specifically that the illnesses and injuries were inflicted by or at the instruction of the uncle. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by assessing the medical reports for what was not contained in them, rather than for what information they did provide.\n",
      "[30] I have reviewed the medical reports carefully. The report from XXXX XXXX XXXX indicates the PA was \"experiencing Exsanguinations when he was admitted to the emergency ward\" on XXXX XXXX, 2013.14 It supports the PA's claim that he was injured in some way that day requiring hospital treatment. The reports from XXXX XXXX XXXX indicate the PA's father was admitted for declining health, that no significant findings were made and that he was discharged when his family was concerned he wasn't improving.15 Finally, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX reports support that both the PA and his father were treated for spiritual illnesses.16 Certainly, these reports generally correlate with the Appellants' overall claims of injuries and illnesses to himself and his father. On their own, however, these reports do not provide sufficient corroborative evidence to overcome the significant credibility concerns.\n",
      "[31] I find that the Appellants have not credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that the injuries and illnesses they claim to have suffered in Nigeria were at the hands of the PA's uncle. I confirm the RPD's conclusion in this respect.\n",
      "Failure of PA to claim asylum in U.S.\n",
      "[32] The RPD found that it was reasonable to expect that the PA would have made some inquiries into how to regularize his status in the U.S. between his arrival in XXXX 2014 and January 2018 when he filed a claim for refugee status in Canada. The RPD rejected his explanation that he thought refugee status was only given to persons fleeing war, as the PA is well-educated and has travelled internationally. The RPD also noted that the PA's visitor visa expired on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and he had made no efforts to consider the options he had in the U.S. despite his testimony that he left Nigeria because he believed his life was in danger.\n",
      "[33] The Appellants argue that the PA believed only persons fleeing war could apply for refugee status. They argue that after the PA's visitor visa expired he was in a relationship that resulted in him being sponsored and able to obtain a work permit. The last work permit was issued XXXX XXXX, 2017 and expired in XXXX 2018. Finally, they argue the PA's profile meant the U.S. would not give him asylum after the new administration came into power.\n",
      "[34] Following my review and analysis, I cannot agree with all of the Appellants' arguments. I note that the PA testified that he left Nigeria because he believed he would be killed by his uncle. In XXXX 2014, after he learned his wife was assaulted, the PA testified he knew he could not return to Nigeria. Once in the U.S., the PA was without status from the expiry of his visitor visa on XXXX XXXX, 2015 until he married in XXXX 2015, a period of 7 months. Failing to inquire or explore any option to resolve his fear of harm in Nigeria is inconsistent with the PA's claims.\n",
      "[35] I agree that between XXXX 2015 and XXXX 2017, the PA was sponsored and this may not have caused him to be concerned about his fear in Nigeria. However, after the PA's relationship ended in XXXX 2017 and his sponsorship was withdrawn, his wife and children joined him in the U.S. in XXXX 2017. Despite his wife filing for asylum in the U.S., the PA believed that they would not be successful in the U.S. because of the American political context.\n",
      "[36] The Appellants argue that the RPD ignored three articles they submitted with respect to the U.S. political context. They argue that these articles justify the the Appellants' need to seek asylum in Canada rather than in the U.S. because of their profile.\n",
      "[37] Having completed my own review and assessment, I do not find that the RPD erred. There is no documentary evidence that indicates that the Trump administration has changed its asylum laws or that the U.S. is no longer a Signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees. I agree with the RPD's conclusion and accept the finding that the PA's failure to seek asylum in the U.S. is inconsistent with having a subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n",
      "Claim for protection in relation to sexual assault in Nigeria\n",
      "[38] The Appellants argue that the SA and her daughter should be considered Convention refugees based on the general risk of sexual violence for women in Nigeria. They allege the RPD erred by failing to conduct this analysis. The RPD decision does not make reference to the issue. I have conducted my own analysis and find that the Appellants have failed to establish the SA and her daughter would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of their gender.\n",
      "[39] Country documentation does indicate that sexual assault in widespread in Nigeria17. This alone, however, is insufficient to establish that the SA and her daughter face a serious possibility of persecution. The Appellants have the onus to show that they are individually at risk of sexual assault.\n",
      "[40] It is important to note that in order to establish the SA's claim under section 96 there must be evidence supporting a subjective fear of harm that is unrelated to the Appellants' claims with respect to the uncle as those allegations have not been established.\n",
      "[41] In her BOC narrative, the SA stated that she is fearful of the uncle and terrified that she could be sexually assaulted again. She also stated she fears the same could happen to her daughter. In testimony, she stated that she is afraid of the uncle, the men who raped her in 2013 and the man who followed her in XXXX 2017. She stated that did not know who the men were in these attacks but believes in was related to the uncle. In my review of the record, I see no evidence in relation to the SA's fear of she and her daughter being sexually assaulted other than as it is stated in her BOC.\n",
      "[42] The Appellants argue that country documentation provides an objective basis to support this claim. However, they do not provide any other support for why the female appellant and her daughter would be personally at risk. The SA is an educated woman, a teacher and lives in the south of Nigeria. She has resources and is not a vulnerable person. She does not live in a conflict area, she does not live in poverty. In addition, she is married and does not live alone. The claimants have not established that their profile gives rise to a serious possibility of persecution.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[43] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n",
